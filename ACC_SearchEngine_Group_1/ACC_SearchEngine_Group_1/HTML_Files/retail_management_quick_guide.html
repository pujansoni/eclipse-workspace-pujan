<h1>Retail Management - Overview</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In my whole retailing career, I have stuck to one guiding principle: give your customers what they want…and customers want everything: a wide assortment of good quality merchandise, lowest possible prices, guaranteed satisfaction with what they buy, friendly knowledgeable service, convenient hours, free parking, and a pleasant shopping experience.</i></p>
<p><i>You love it when you visit a store that somehow exceeds your expectations and you hate it when a store inconveniences you, or gives you hard time, or just pretends you are invisible…</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i><b>&minus; Sam Walton (Founder, Walmart)</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the complex world of today, the consumer is king and retailers are keener on consumer satisfaction. Considering the busy lifestyles of today’s consumers, the retailers also provide services apart from products.</p>
<p>Retailing occupies a very important place in the economics of any country. It is the final stage of distribution of product or service. It not only contributes to country’s GDP but also empowers a large number of people by providing employment.</p>
<p>Retail Management starts with understanding the term 'Retail'.</p>
<h2>What is Retail?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;">Retailing includes all activities involved in selling goods or services to the final consumers for personal, non-business use.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><b>&minus; Phillip Kotler</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any organization that sells the products for consumption to the customers for their personal, family, or household use is in the occupation of retailing.</p>
<h3>Functions of a Retailor</h3>
<p>Retailor provides the goods that customer needs, in a desired form, at a required time and place.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A retailor does not sell raw material. He sells finished goods or services in the <b>form</b> that customer wants.</p></li>
<li><p>A retailer buys a wide range of products from different wholesalers and offers the best products under one roof. Thus, the retailor performs the function of both <b>buying</b> and <b>selling</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>A retailor keeps the products or services within easy reach of the customer by making them available at appropriate <b>location</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Retail in Marketing Channels</h3>
<p>With industrialization and globalization, the distance between the manufacturer and the consumer has increased. Many times a product is manufactured in one country and sold in another. The levels of intermediaries involved in the marketing channel depends upon the level of service the consumer desires.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/marketing_channels.jpg" alt="Marketing Channels" />
<p><b>Type A and B</b> &minus; Retailers. For example, Pantaloons, Walmart.</p>
<p><b>Type C</b> &minus; Service Providers. For example, Eureka Forbes.</p>
<h2>Classification of Retailing Formats</h2>
<p>The retailing formats can be classified into following types as shown in the diagram &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/retailing_formats.jpg" alt="Retailing Formats" />
<h3>Ownership Based Retailing</h3>
<p>Let us see these retailers in detail &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Independent Retailers</b> &minus; They own and run a single shop, and determine their policies independently. Their family members can help in business and the ownership of the unit can be passed from one generation to next. The biggest advantage is they can build personal rapport with consumers very easily. For example, stand-alone grocery shops, florists, stationery shops, book shops, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Chain Stores</b> &minus; When multiple outlets are under common ownership it is called a chain of stores. Chain stores offer and keep similar merchandise. They are spread over cities and regions. The advantage is, the stores can keep selected merchandise according to the consumers’ preferences in a particular area. For example, Westside Stores, Shopper’s Stop, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Franchises</b> &minus; These are stores that run business under an established brand name or a particular format by an agreement between franchiser and a franchisee. They can be of two types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Business format. For example, Pizza Hut.</li>
<li>Product format. For example, Ice cream parlors of Amul.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Consumers Co-Operative Stores</b> &minus; These are businesses owned and run by consumers with the aim of providing essentials at reasonable cost as compared to market rates. They have to be contemporary with the current business and political policies to keep the business healthy. For example, Sahakar Bhandar from India, Puget Consumers Food Co-Operative from north US, Dublin Food Co-Operative from Ireland.
</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Merchandise Based Retailing</h3>
<p>Let us see these in detail &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Convenience Stores</b> &minus; They are small stores generally located near residential premises, and are kept open till late night or 24x7. These stores offer basic essentials such as food, eggs, milk, toiletries, and groceries. They target consumers who want to make quick and easy purchases.</p>
<p>For example, mom-and-pop stores, stores located near petrol pumps, 7-Eleven from US, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Supermarkets</b> &minus; These are large stores with high volume and low profit margin. They target mass consumer and their selling area ranges from 8000 sq.ft. to 10,000 sq.ft. They offer fresh as well as preserved food items, toiletries, groceries and basic household items. Here, at least 70% selling space is reserved for food and
grocery products.</p>
<p>For example, Food Bazar and Tesco.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hypermarkets</b> &minus; These are one-stop shopping retail stores with at least 3000 sq.ft. selling space, out of which 35% space is dedicated towards non-grocery products. They target consumers over large area, and often share space with restaurants and coffee shops. The hypermarket can spread over the space of 80,000 sq.ft. to 250,000 sq.ft. They offer exercise equipment, cycles, CD/DVDs, Books, Electronics equipment, etc.</p>
<p>For example, Big Bazar from India, Walmart from US.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Specialty Stores</b> &minus; These retail stores offer a particular kind of merchandise such as home furnishing, domestic electronic appliances, computers and related products, etc. They also offer high level service and product information to consumers. They occupy at least 8000 sq.ft. selling space.</p>
<p>For example, Gautier Furniture and Croma from India, High &amp; Mighty from UK.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Departmental Stores</b> &minus; It is a multi-level, multi-product retail store spread across average size of 20,000 sq.ft. to 50,000 sq.ft. It offers selling space in the range of 10% to 70% for food, clothing, and household items.</p>
<p>For example, The Bombay Store, Ebony, Meena Bazar from India, Marks &amp; Spencer from UK.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Factory Outlets</b> &minus; These are retail stores which sell items that are produced in excess quantity at discounted price. These outlets are located in the close proximity of manufacturing units or in association with other factory outlets.</p>
<p>For example, Nike, Bombay Dyeing factory outlets.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Catalogue Showrooms</b> &minus; These retail outlets keep catalogues of the products for the consumers to refer. The consumer needs to select the product, write its product code and handover it to the clerk who then manages to provide the selected product from the company’s warehouse.</p>
<p>For example, Argos from UK. India’s retail HyperCity has joined hands with Argos to provide a catalogue of over 4000 best quality products in the categories of computers, home furnishing, electronics, cookware, fitness, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-Store Based (Direct) Retailing</h3>
<p>It is the form of retailing where the retailer is in direct contact with the consumer at the workplace or at home. The consumer becomes aware of the product via email or phone call from the retailer, or through an ad on the television, or Internet. The seller hosts a party for interacting with people. Then introduces and demonstrates the products, their utility, and benefits. Buying and selling happens at the same place. The consumer itself is a distributor.</p>
<p>For example, Amway and Herbalife multi-level marketing.</p>
<p>Non-Store based retailing includes non-personal contact based retailing such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Mail Orders/Postal Orders/E-Shopping</b> &minus; The consumer can refer a product catalogue on internet and place order for purchasing the product via email/post.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Telemarketing</b> &minus; The products are advertised on the television. The price, warranty, return policies, buying schemes, contact number etc. are described at the end of the Ad. The consumers can place order by calling the retailer’s number. The retailer then delivers the product at the consumer’s doorstep. For example, Asian Skyshop.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Automated Vending/Kiosks</b> &minus; It is most convenient to the consumers and offers frequently purchased items round the clock, such as drinks, candies, chips, newspapers, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The success of non-store based retailing hugely lies in timely delivery of appropriate product.</p>
<h3>Service Based Retailing</h3>
<p>These retailers provide various services to the end consumer. The services include banking, car rentals, electricity, and cooking gas container delivery.</p>
<p>The success of service based retailer lies in service quality, customization, differentiation and timeliness of service, technological upgradation, and consumer-oriented pricing.</p>

<p>Though the barter system is considered as the oldest form of retailing, the traditional forms of retailing such as neighborhood stores, main-street stores and fairs still exist in the laid-back towns around the world. During post-war years in the US and Europe, small retailers reformed their shops into large organized stores, markets, and malls.</p>
<p>Retail evolution mainly took place in three stages &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Conventional</li>
<li>Established</li>

<h1>Retail Challenges &amp; Theories</h1>
<p>Michael Porter, a professor from Harvard Business School, designed a framework named <b>Five Forces Analysis</b> for structured analysis of industries. This framework helps to understand the degree of competition in the industry. Let us see according to his framework, what are the five fundamental forces of competition in the retail industry &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/five_forces_analysis.jpg" alt="Five Forces Analysis" />
<h2>Threat of New Competitors</h2>
<p>The easier it is for a new company to enter the industry, fiercer is the competition. Any new entrant poses a threat to the existing players as it can decrease the profit share of existing players. The factors that limit new entrants are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>How loyal are end consumers in the industry?</li>
<li>How difficult it is for the consumer to switch to the new product?</li>
<li>How large is the amount of capital required to enter into the industry?</li>
<li>How difficult it is to access distribution channel?</li>
<li>How hard it is to acquire new skills for the staff?</li>
</ul>
<table class="table table-bordered"> 
<tr>
<th>Threat is high when…</th>
<th>Threat is low when…</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Products of the retail company are not differentiated.</td>
<td>Products of the retail company are differentiated.</td>

<tr>
<td>Consumer perception is not good for existing product and switching cost is low.</td>
<td>Consumer perception is healthy for existing product and switching cost is high.</td>

</table>
<p>For example, Pizza Hut, an old player in food services retail, was founded in 1958 at Kansas, US. The entry of Dominos in 1960 at Michigan posed a threat of competition to it. But following their different marketing policies, they both have acquired prominent places in the market.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/new_competitors.jpg" alt="New Competitors" />
<h2>Threat of Substitutes</h2>
<p>Substitutes are the products or services that provide the same functionality. A successful product leads to creating other similar products. While entering into retail, one should think of &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>How many near substitutes are available in the market?</li>
<li>What is the price of the substitute?</li>
<li>What is the consumer perception about those substitutes?</li>
</ul>
<p>By advertising, marketing, and investing in R&amp;D for the product or service, a retail business can elevate its position in the industry.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered"> 
<tr>
<th>Substitute threat is high when…</th>
<th>Substitute threat is low when…</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Products of the retail company are not differentiated.</td>
<td>Products of the retail company are differentiated.</td>

<tr>
<td>Cheaper parallel products of the same category are available.</td>
<td>No cheaper parallel products are available.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/threat_of_substitutes.jpg" alt="Threat of Substitutes" />
<p>For example, Google+ and Facebook both are social platforms the consumers use for socializing. They provide similar features such as posts, chat, share text, graphics and media content, forming groups, etc.</p>
<h2>Bargaining Power of Buyers</h2>
<p>It is the position of buyers and likelihood of their ability to gain benefit while buying. If there are many suppliers and few buyers, the buyers are at advantageous position while pricing and they generally have the last word. The retail managers need to think of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>How large market share the retail company has?</li>
<li>What size of consumers is the company depending upon for its sales?</li>
<li>Are buyers buying in large volumes?</li>
<li>How many other retail competitors are in the same product line?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bargaining Power of Suppliers</h2>
<p>It is the ability of the supplier to control the cost and supply of the products in the market. If the suppliers are at a dominating position over the company while product pricing, threatening to raise price or reduce supply, then that retail industry is said to be less attractive. The retail managers need to find out answers for the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>What are the substitute products other than what the supplier provides?</li>
<li>Is the supplier providing goods to multiple industries?</li>
<li>Is the supplier-switching cost high?</li>
<li>If the supplier and the company are capable of entering into one another’s business?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intensity of Rivalry among Existing Competitors</h2>
<p>The rivalry is intense when there are more or less equal sized competitors in the market and there is no unparalleled market leader.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered"> 
<tr>
<th>Intensity of Rivalry is high when…</th>
<th>Intensity of Rivalry is low when…</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>There is no or very less product or service differentiation.</td>
<td>The product or service is in differentiation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>There are less competitors.</td>
<td>There are more competitors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Availability of product in a particular area is less.</td>
<td>The product is widely available in a particular area.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Theories of Development</h2>
<p>In retail management, theories can be broadly classified as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Environmental Theory (Natural Selection)</h3>
<p>It is based on Darwin’s theory of survival: “The fittest would survive the longest”. The retail sector comprises consumers, manufacturers, marketers, suppliers, and changing technology. Those retailers that adapt to changes in demography, technology, consumer preferences, and legal changes are more likely to survive for long and prosper.</p>
<h3>Cyclical Theory</h3>
<p>McNair represents this theory by <b>Wheel of Retailing</b> that explains the changes taking place in retailing.</p>
<p>According to him, the new entrant retailers are often into low cost, low profit margin, low structure retail business, which offers some unique, real benefit to the consumers. Over some time they establish themselves well, prosper, and expand their products with more expensive facilities, without losing focus on their core values.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/cyclical_theory.jpg" alt="Cyclical Theory" />
<p>This creates a place for yet new entrants in the market thereby creating threat of
competition, substitution, and rivalry.</p>
<h3>Conflict Theories (Evolution through Dialectic Process)</h3>
<p>Within a broad retail category, there is always a conflict between the retailing of similar formats, which leads to the development of new formats. Thus, the new retail formats are evolved through dialectic process of blending two formats.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/evolution_through_dialectic.jpg" alt="Evolution through Dialectic" />
<p>Say, <b>Thesis</b> is a single retailer around the corner of the residential area. <b>Antithesis</b> is a large departmental store nearby the same residential area, which develops over some time in opposition to Thesis. <b>Antithesis</b> poses a challenge to <b>Thesis</b>. When there is conflict between Thesis and Antithesis, a new format of retail is born.</p>
<h1>Understanding Retail Consumer</h1>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i>Whether it is stocks or socks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i><b>&minus; Warren Buffet (American business magnate)</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding retail consumer deals with understanding their buying behavior in retail stores. Understanding the consumer is important to know who buys what, when, and how. It is also important to know how to evaluate consumer’s response to sales promotion. It is very vital to understand the consumer in the retail sector for the survival and prosperity of the business.</p>
<h2>Consumer versus Customer</h2>
<p>A <b>consumer</b> is a user of a product or a service whereas a <b>customer</b> is a buyer of the product or service. The customer decides what to buy and executes the deal of purchasing by paying and availing the product or service. The <b>consumer</b> uses the product or service for oneself.</p>
<p>For example, the customer of a pet food is not the consumer of the same. Also, if a mother in a supermarket is buying <i>Nestlé Milo</i> for her toddler son then she is a customer and her son is a consumer.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/consumer_versus_customer.jpg" alt="Consumer Versus Customer" />
<h3>Identifying a Customer</h3>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to understand who is actually a decision maker while purchasing when a customer enters the shop accompanying someone else. Thus everyone who enters the shop is considered as a customer. Still, it is necessary to identify composition and origin of the customers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Composition of Customers</b> &minus; It includes customers of various gender, age, economic and educational status, religion, nationality, and occupation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Origin of Customer</b> &minus; From where the customer comes to shop, how much the customer travels to reach the shop, and which type of area the customer lives in.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Objective of Customer</b> &minus; Shopping or Buying? Shopping is visiting the shops with the intention of looking for new products and may or may not necessarily include buying. Buying means actually purchasing a product. What does the customer’s body language depict?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Customer’s Buying Behavior Patterns</h2>
<p>The needs, tastes, and preferences of the consumer for whom the products are purchased drives the buying behavior of the customer. The pattern of customer’s buying behavior can be categorized as &minus;</p>
<h3>Place of Purchase</h3>
<p>Customers divide their place of purchase. Even if all the products they want are available at a shop, they prefer to visit various shops and compare them in terms of prices. When the customers have a choice of which shop to buy from, their loyalty does not remain permanent to a single shop.</p>
<p>Study of customer’s place of purchase is important for selection of location, keeping appropriate merchandise, and selecting a distributor in close proximity.</p>
<h3>Product Purchased</h3>
<p>It pertains to what items and how many units of items the customer purchases. The customer purchases a product depending upon the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Availability/Shortage of product</li>
<li>Requirement/Choice of product</li>
<li>Perishability of product</li>
<li>Storage requirements</li>
<li>Purchasing power of oneself</li>
</ul>
<p>This category is important for producers, distributors, and retailers. Say, soaps, toothbrushes, potatoes, and apples are purchased by a large group of customers irrespective of their demographics but live lobsters, French grapes, avocadoes, baked beans, or beef are purchased by only a small number of customers with strong regional demarcation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the customers rarely purchase a single potato or a banana, like more than two watermelons at a time.</p>
<h3>Time and Frequency of Purchase</h3>
<p>Retailers need to keep their working time tuned with customer’s availability. The time of purchase is influenced by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Season</li>
<li>Location of customer</li>
</ul>
<p>The frequency of purchase mainly depends on the following factors &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Type of commodity</li>
<li>Degree of necessity involved</li>
<li>Lifestyle of customers</li>
<li>Festivals and customs</li>
<li>Influence of the person accompanying the customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Indian family man from intermediate income group would purchase a car not more than two times in his lifetime whereas a same-class customer from US may buy it more frequently. A tennis player would buy required stuff more frequently than a student learning tennis at a school.</p>
<h3>Method of Purchase</h3>
<p>It is the way a customer purchases. It involves factors such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Is the customer purchasing alone or is accompanied by someone?</li>
<li>How does the customer pay: by cash or by credit?</li>
<li>What is the mode of travel for the customer?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Response to Sales Promotion Methods</h3>
<p>The more the customer visits a retail shop, the more (s)he is exposed to the sales promotion methods. The use of sales promotional devices increases the number of shop visitors-turned-impulsive buyers.</p>
<p>The promotional methods include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Displays</b> &minus; Consumer products are packaged and displayed with aesthetics while on display. Shape, size, color, and decoration create appeal.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Demonstrations</b> &minus; Consumers are influenced by giving away sample product or by showing how to use the product and its benefits.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Special pricing</b> &minus; Unit’s special price under some scheme or during festive season, coupons, contests, prizes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sales talks</b> &minus; It is verbal or printed advertisement conducted by the salesperson in the shop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An urban customer, due to fast paced life would select easy-to-cook or ready-to-eat food over raw food material as compared to rural counterpart who comes from laid-back lifestyle and self-sufficiency in food items grown on farm.</p>
<p>It is found that the couples buy more items in a single transaction than a man or a woman shopping alone. Customers devote time for analyzing alternative products or services. Customers purchase required and perishable products quickly but when it comes to investing in consumer durables, (s)he tries to gather more information about the product.</p>
<h2>Factors Influencing Retail Consumer</h2>
<p>Understanding consumer behavior is critical for a retail business in order to create and develop effective marketing strategies and employ four Ps of marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, and Promotion) to generate high revenue in the long run.</p>
<p>Here are some factors which directly influence consumer buying behavior &minus;</p>
<h3>Market Conditions/Recession</h3>
<p>In a well-performing market, customers don’t mind spending on comfort and luxuries. In contrast, during an economic crisis they tend to prioritize their requirements from basic needs to luxuries, in that order and focus only on what is absolutely essential to survive.</p>
<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
<p>Every child (a would-be-customer) acquires a personality, thought process, and attitude while growing up by learning, observing, and forming opinions, likes, and dislikes from its surrounding. Buying behavior differs in people depending on the various cultures they are brought up in and different demographics they come from.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/cultural_background.jpg" alt="Cultural Background" />
<h3>Social Status</h3>
<p>Social status is nothing but a position of the customer in the society. Generally, people form groups while interacting with each other for the satisfaction of their social needs.</p>
<p>These groups have prominent effects on the buying behavior. When customers buy with family members or friends, the chances are more that their choice is altered or biased under peer pressure for the purpose of trying something new. Dominating people in the family can alter the choice or decision making of a submissive customer.</p>
<h3>Income Levels</h3>
<p>Consumers with high income has high self-respect and expects everything best when it comes to buying products or availing services. Consumers of this class don’t generally think twice on cost if he is buying a good quality product.</p>
<p>On the other hand, low-income group consumers would prefer a low-cost substitute of the same product. For example, a professional earning handsome pay package would not hesitate to buy an iPhone6 but a taxi driver in India would buy a low-cost mobile.</p>
<h3>Personal Elements</h3>
<p>Here is how the personal elements change buying behavior &minus;</p>
<p><b>Gender</b> &minus; Men and women differ in their perspective, objective, and habits while deciding what to buy and actually buying it. Researchers at Wharton’s Jay H. Baker Retail Initiative and the Verde Group, studied men and women on shopping and found that men buy, while women shop. Women have an emotional attachment to shopping and for men it is a mission. Hence, men shop fast and women stay in the shop for a longer time. Men make faster decisions, women prefer to look for better deals even if they have decided on buying a particular product.</p>
<p>Wise retail managers set their marketing policies such that the four Ps are appealing to both the genders.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Age</b> &minus; People belonging to different ages or stages of life cycles make different purchase decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Occupation</b> &minus; The occupational status changes the requirement of the products or services. For example, a person working as a small-scale farmer may not require a high-priced electronic gadget but an IT professional would need it.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Lifestyle</b> &minus; Customers of different lifestyles choose different products within the same culture.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Nature</b> &minus; Customers with high personal awareness, confidence, adaptability, and dominance are too choosy and take time while selecting a product but are quick in making a buying decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Psychological Elements</h3>
<p>Psychological factors are a major influence in customer’s buying behavior. Some of them
are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Motivation</b> &minus; Customers often make purchase decisions by particular motives such as natural force of hunger, thirst, need of safety, to name a few.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Perception</b> &minus; Customers form different perceptions about various products or services of the same category after using it. Hence perceptions of customer leads to biased buying decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Learning</b> &minus; Customers learn about new products or services in the market from various resources such as peers, advertisements, and Internet. Hence, learning largely affects their buying decisions. For example, today’s IT-age customer finds out the difference between two products’ specifications, costs, durability, expected life, looks, etc., and then decides which one to buy.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Beliefs and Attitudes</b> &minus; Beliefs and attitudes are important drivers of customer’s buying decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Consumer’s Decision Making Process</h2>
<p>A customer goes through a number of stages as shown in the following figure before
actually deciding to buy the product.</p>
<p>However, customers get to know about a product from each other. Smart retail managers therefore insist on recording customers’ feedback upon using the product. They can use this information while interacting with the manufacturer on how to upgrade the product.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/decision_making_process.jpg" alt="Decision Making Process" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Identifying one’s need is the stimulating factor in buying decision. Here, the customer recognizes his need of buying a product. As far as satisfying a basic need such as hunger, thirst goes, the customer tends to decide quickly. But this step is important when the customer is buying consumer durables.</p></li>
<li><p>In the next step, the customer tries to find out as much information as he can about the product.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, the customer tries to seek the alternative products.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, the customer selects the best product available as per choice and budget, and decides to buy the same.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Retail Market Segmentation &amp; Strategies</h1>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i>Market segmentation is the natural result of vast differences among people.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i><b>&minus; Donald Norman (Director, The Design Lab)</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market segmentation gives a clear understanding of the retail customers’ requirements. With the clear understanding of market segmentation, the retail managers and marketing personnel can develop strategies to reach out to the customers with specific needs and preferences.</p>
<h2>What is a Market Segmentation?</h2>
<p>It is a process by which the customers are divided into identifiable groups based on their product or service requirements. Market segmentation is very useful for the marketing force of the retail organization to create a custom marketing mix for specific groups.</p>
<p>For example, Venus is in the business of retailing organic vegetables. She would prefer to invest her money for advertising to reach out to working and health conscious people who have monthly income of more than say, $10,000.</p>
<p>Market segmentation can also be conducted based on customer’s gender, age, religion, nationality, culture, profession, and preferences.</p>
<h2>Types of Retail Markets</h2>
<p>There are two types of retails &minus; Organized Retail and Unorganized Retail.</p>
<h3>Organized Retail</h3>
<p>Organized Retailing is a large retail chain of shops run with up-to-date technology, accounting transparency, supply chain management, and distribution systems.</p>
<h3>Unorganized Retail</h3>
<p>Unorganized Retailing is nothing but a small retail business conducted by an owner or a caretaker of the shop with no technological and accounting aids.</p>
<p>The following table highlights the points that differentiate organized retail from unorganized retail &minus;</p>

<h2>What is Retail Strategy?</h2>
<p>It is a plan designed by a retail organization on how the business intends to offer its products and services to the customers. There can be various strategies such as merchandise strategy, own-brand strategy, promotion strategy, to name a few.</p>
<p>A retail strategy includes identification of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The retailer’s target market.</li>
<li>Retail format the retailer works out to satisfy the target market’s needs.</li>
<li>Sustainable competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategies for Effective Market Segmentation</h2>
<p>For effective market segmentation, the following two strategies are used by the marketing force of the organization &minus;</p>
<h3>Concentration (Niche) Strategy</h3>
<p>Under this strategy, an organization focuses going after large share of only one or very few segment(s). This strategy provides a differential advantage over competing organizations which are not solely concentrating on one segment.</p>
<p>For example, Toyota employs this strategy by offering various models under hybrid vehicles market.</p>
<h3>Multi-segment Strategy</h3>
<p>Under this strategy, an organization focuses its marketing efforts on two or more distinct market segments.</p>
<p>For example, Johnson and Johnson offers healthcare products in the range of baby care, skin care, nutritionals, and vision care products segmented for the customers of all ages.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Market Penetration</h2>
<p>Market penetration strategies include the following &minus;</p>
<h3>Price Penetration</h3>
<p>It is setting the price of the product or service lesser than that of the competitor’s product or service. Due to decreased cost, volume may increase which can help to maintain a decent level of profit.</p>
<h3>Aggressive Promotion</h3>
<p>Increasing product or service promotion on TV, print media, radio channels, e-mails, pulls the customers and drives them to view and avail the product or service. By offering discounts, various buying schemes along with the added benefits can be useful in high market penetration.</p>
<h3>High Product Distribution</h3>
<p>By distributing the product or service up to the level of saturation helps penetration of market in a better way. For example, Coca Cola has a very high distribution and is available everywhere from small shops to hypermarkets.</p>
<h2>Growth Strategies</h2>
<p>If a retail organization conducts <b>SWOT Analysis</b> (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) before considering growth strategies, it is helpful for analyzing the organization’s current strategy and planning the growth strategy.</p>
<h3>Ansoff’s Matrix</h3>
<p>An American planning expert named Igor Ansoff developed a strategic planning tool that presents four alternative growth strategies. On one dimension there are products and on the other is markets.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/ansoff_matrix.jpg" alt="Ansoff’s Matrix" />
<p>This matrix provides strategies for market growth. Here is the sequence of these strategies &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Market Penetration</b> &minus; Company focuses on selling the existing products or services in the existing market for higher market share.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Market Development</b> &minus; Company focuses on selling existing products or services to new markets or market segments.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Product Development</b> &minus; Company works on innovations in existing products or developing new products for the existing market.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Diversification</b> &minus; Company works on developing new products or services for new markets.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Retail Management - Business Location</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Silicon valley is a mindset; not a location.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i><b>&minus; Reid Hoffman (Co-Founder, LinkedIn)</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before visiting a mall or a shop, the first question that arises in consumers’ mind is, “How far do I have to walk/drive?”</p>
<p>In populous cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Tokyo, and Shanghai to name a few, consumers face rush-hour traffic jams or jams because of road structure. In such cases, to access a retail outlet to procure day-to-day needs becomes very difficult. It is very important for the consumers to have retail stores near where they stay.</p>

<h3>Solitary Sites</h3>
<p>These are single, free standing shops/outlets, which are isolated from other retailers. They are positioned on roads or near other retailers or shopping centers. They are mainly used for food and non-food retailing, or as convenience shops. For example, kiosks, mom-andpop stores (similar to <i>kirana</i> stores in India).</p>

<p><b>Step 5 – Finalize the best and most suitable Location for the retail outlet.</b></p>
<h2>Measuring the Success of Location</h2>
<p>Once the retail outlet is opened at the selected location, it is important to keep track of how feasible was the choice of the location. To understand this, the retail company carries out two types of location assessments &minus;</p>
<h3>Macro Location Evaluation</h3>
<p>It is conducted at a national level when the company wants to start a retail business internationally. Under this assessment, the following steps are carried out &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Detailed external audit of the market by analyzing locations as macro environment such as political, social, economic, and technical.</p></li>
<li><p>Most important factors are listed such as customer’s level of spending, degree of competition, Personal Disposable Income (PDI), availability of locations, etc., and minimum acceptable level for each factor is defined and the countries are ranked.</p></li>
<li><p>The same factors listed above are considered for local regions within the selected countries to find a reliable location.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Micro Location Evaluation</h3>
<p>At this level of evaluation, the location is assessed against four factors namely &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Population</b> &minus; Desirable number of suitable customers who will shop.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Infrastructure</b> &minus; The degree to which the store is accessible to the potential customers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Store Outlet</b> &minus; Identifying the level of competing stores (those which the decrease attractiveness of a location) as well as complementary stores (which increase attractiveness of a location).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cost</b> &minus; Costs of development and operation. High startup and ongoing costs affect the performance of retail business.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><b>Step 7 - Record the Buying Figures</b> &minus; Recording details of transactions, number of unit pieces of products according to product categories and sub-classes, and respective unit prices in the inventory management system of the retail business.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor Relations</h3>
<p>Cordial relationship with the vendor can be a great asset for the business. A strong rapport with vendors can lead to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

</ul>
<h2>Merchandise Performance</h2>
<p>The following methods are commonly practiced to analyze merchandise performance &minus;</p>
<h3>ABC Analysis</h3>
<p>It is a process of inventory classification in which the total inventory is classified into three categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>A – Extremely Important Items</b> &minus; Very crucial inventory control on order scheduling, safety, prompt inspection, consumption pattern, stock balance, refill demands.</p></li>
<li><p><b>B – Moderately Important Items</b> &minus; Average attention is paid to them.</p></li>
<li><p><b>C – Less important Items</b> &minus; Inventory control is completely stress free.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach of segregation gives importance to each item in the inventory. For example, the telescope retailing company might be having small market share but each telescope is an expensive item in its inventory. This way, a company can decide its investment policy in particular items.</p>
<h3>Sell-Through Analysis</h3>
<p>In this method, the actual sales and forecast sales are compared and the difference is analyzed to determine whether to apply markdown or to place a fresh request for additional merchandise to satisfy current demand.</p>
<p>This method is very helpful in evaluating fashion merchandise performance.</p>
<h3>Multi-Attribute Method</h3>
<p>This method is based on the concept that the customers consider a retailer or a product as a set of features and attributes. It is used to analyze various alternatives available with regard to vendors and select the best one, which satisfies the store requirements.</p>
<h1>Retail Management - Business Operations</h1>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i>Customers remember the service a lot longer than they remember the price.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i><b>&minus; Lauren Freedman (President, E-tailing Group)</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The retail business operations include all the activities that the employers perform to keep the store functioning smoothly. The shopping experience of a customer is planned before the customer enters, shops, and leaves the store with a smile or with agony by carrying a perception about the store. This experience drives the customer’s decision of visiting the store in future.</p>
<p>Let us see, what efforts retail business operations executives put in to make the shopping experience memorable for the customer.</p>
<h2>Store Management</h2>
<p>The retail store being the fundamental source of revenue and the place of customer
interaction, is vital to the retailer.</p>
<p>The store manager may not himself perform, but is responsible for the following duties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Maintaining cleanliness in the store.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring adequate stock of merchandise in the store.</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate planning, scheduling, and organization of staff, inventory and expenses, for short and long-term success.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring the loss and taking preventive measures to protect the company’s assets and products in the store.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrading store to reflect high profitable image.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating with head office/regional office when required.</p></li>
<li><p>Conducting constructive meetings with staff to boost their morale and motivate the staff to achieve sales goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating with customers to identify their needs, grievances, and complaints.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring that the store is in compliance with employment laws regarding salary, work hours, and equal employment opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing performance appraisals for assisting staff.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The store manager ensures that these duties are performed according to the guidelines
set by the company.</p>
<h2>Premises Management</h2>
<p>The store premises are as important as the retail store itself. Managing premises includes the following tasks &minus;</p>
<p><b>Determining Working Hours of Store.</b> It majorly depends upon the target audience, retailed products, and store location.</p>
<p>For example, a grocery store near residential area should open earlier than a fashion store. Also, a solitary store can be open as long as the owner wants to but a store in a mall has to adhere to working hours set by the mall management.</p>
<p><b>Managing Store Security.</b> It helps avoiding inventory shrinkage. It depends upon the size of store, the product, and the location of store. Some retailers attach electronic tags on products, which are sensed at store entrance and exits by sensors for theft detection. Some stores install video cameras to monitor movement and some provide separate entry and exit for personnel so that they can be checked.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/managing_store_security.jpg" alt="Managing Store Security" />
<p>For example, a large departmental store needs high security than the grocery store located near residential area.</p>
<p>Here are some basic formulae used while managing premises &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Transaction per Hour = No. of Transactions/Number of Hours
</pre>
<p>The retailer keeps track of the number of transactions per hour, which helps in determining store hours and staff scheduling.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Sales per Transaction = Net Sales/Number of Transactions 
</pre>
<p>The result gives the value of the average sales and net return, which is used to study sales trends over time.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hourly Customer Traffic = Customer Traffic In/Number of Hours
</pre>
<p>This measure is used to track total number of customer traffic per unit time. It is then applied to schedule hours and determine staff strength.</p>
<h2>Inventory Management</h2>
<p>Merchandise manager, category manager, and other staff handle the inventory. It includes the following tasks &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Receiving products from the vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording inward entry of the products.</p></li>
<li><p>Checking the products against quality norms laid by the retail company and for details such as colors, sizes, and styles. In case of large stores, this task is automated to a large extent.</p></li>
<li><p>Separating and documenting the faulty or damaged products for returning.</p></li>
<li><p>Displaying the products appropriately to gain customers’ attention. Heavy products are kept at the lower level. Most accessed products are kept at the eye-level and the less accessed products are kept at high level of shelves. On-the-fly-purchased products such as chocolates, candies, etc. are placed near payment counters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some formulae used for inventory control &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Inventory Turnover Rate = Net Sales/Average Retail Value of Inventory
</pre>
<p>It is expressed in number of times and indicates how often the inventory is sold and replaced during a given period of time.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Cost of Goods Sold/Average Value of Inventory at Cost
</pre>
<p>When either of these ratio declines, there is a possibility that inventory is excessive.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
% Inventory Carrying Cost = (Inventory Carrying Cost/Net Sales) * 100 
</pre>
<p>This measure has gained importance due to rise in inventory carrying cost because of high interest rates. This prevents blockage of working capital.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Gross Margin Return on Inventory (GMROI) = Gross Margin/Average Value of Inventory
</pre>
<p>The GMROI compares the margin on sales on the original cost value of merchandise to
yield a return on merchandise investment.</p>
<h2>Receipt Management</h2>
<p>Managing receipt is nothing but determining the manner in which the retailer is going to get the payment for the sold products. The basic modes of receipt are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cash</li>
<li>Credit card</li>
<li>Debit card</li>
<li>Gift card</li>
</ul>
<p>Large stores have the facility of paying by the modes listed above but small retailers generally prefer accepting cash. The retailer pays card fees depending upon the volume of transactions with the suppliers, manufacturers, or producers.</p>
<p>The staff responsible for accepting payment needs to clearly understand the procedure for accepting payment by cards and collecting the amount from the bank.</p>
<h2>Supply Chain Management and Logistics</h2>
<p>Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management of materials, information, and finances while they move from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer. It involves the activities of coordinating and integrating these flows within and out of a retail business.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/retail_management/images/supply_chain_management.jpg" alt="Supply Chain Management" />
<p>Most supply chains operate in collaboration if the suppliers and retail businesses are dealing with each other for a long time. Retailers depend upon supply chain members to a great extent. If the retailers develop a strong partnership with supply chain members, it can be beneficial for suppliers to create seamless procedures, which are difficult to imitate.</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p>The top management of a retail business decides the customer service policy. The entire
retail store staff is trained for customer service. Each employer in the retail store ensures that the service starts with smile and the interacting customer is comfortable and has a pleasant shopping experience.</p>
<p>The promptness and politeness of the retail store staff, their knowledge about the product and language, ability to overcome challenges, and rapidness at the billing counter; everything is noted by the customer. These aspects build a great deal of customer’s perception about the store.</p>
<p>Many retail stores train staff members to handle the cash counter. They have also introduced a concept of express billing where customers buying less than 10 products can bill faster without having to stand in the regular payment queue.</p>
<p>During festivals and markdown periods, the trend of shopping increases.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Customer Conversion Ratio = (Number of Transactions/Customer Traffic) * 100
</pre>
<p>The result is the retailer’s ability to turn a potential customer into a buyer. It is also called “walk to buy ratio”. Low results mean that promotional activities are not being converted into sales and the overall sales efforts need to be assessed afresh.</p>
<h1>Retail Management - Space</h1>
<p>Space management is one of the crucial challenges faced by today’s retail managers. A well-organized shopping place increases productivity of inventory, enhances customers’ shopping experience, reduces operating costs, and increases financial performance of the retail store. It also elevates the chances of customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Let us see, how space management is important and how retailers manage it.</p>
<h2>What is Space Management?</h2>
<p>It is the process of managing the floor space adequately to facilitate the customers and to increase the sale. Since store space is a limited resource, it needs to be used wisely.</p>
<p>Space management is very crucial in retail as the sales volume and gross profitability depends on the amount of space used to generate those sales.</p>
<h2>Optimum Space Use</h2>
<p>While allocating the space to various products, the managers need to consider the
following points &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Product Category &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Profit builders</b> &minus; High profit margins-low sales products. Allocate quality space rather than quantity.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Star performers</b> &minus; Products exceeding sales and profit margins. Allocate large amount of quality space.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Space wasters</b> &minus; Low sales-low profit margins products. Put them at the top or bottom of shelves.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Traffic builders</b> &minus; High sales-low profit margins products. These products need to be displayed close to impulse products.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Size, shape, and weight of the product.</p></li>
<li><p>Product adjacencies &minus; It means which products can coexist on display?</p></li>
<li><p>Product life on the shelf.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Retail Floor Space</h2>
<p>Here are the steps to take into consideration for using floor space effectively &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Measure the total area of space available.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide this area into selling and non-selling areas such as aisle, storage, promotional displays, customer support cell, (trial rooms in case of clothing retail) and billing counters.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <b>Planogram</b>, a pictorial diagram that depicts how and where to place specific retail products on shelves or displays in order to increase customer purchases.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocate the selling space to each product category. Determine the amount of space for a particular category by considering historical and forecasted sales data. Determine the space for billing counter by referring historical customer volume data. In case of clothing retail, allocate a separate space for trial rooms that is near the product display but away from the billing area.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the location of the product categories within the space. This helps the customers to locate the required product easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide product adjacencies logically. This facilitates multiple product purchase. For example, pasta sauces and spices are kept near raw pasta packets.</p></li>
<li><p>Make use of irregular shaped corner space wisely. Some products such as domestic cleaning devices or garden furniture can stand in a corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocate space for promotional displays and schemes facing towards road to notify
and attract the customers. Use glass walls or doors wisely for promotion.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Store Layout and Design</h2>
<p>Customer buying behavior is an important point of consideration while designing store
layout. The objectives of store layout and design are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>It should attract customers.</li>
<li>It should help the customers to locate the products effortlessly.</li>
<li>It should help the customers spend longer time in the store.</li>
<li>It should motivate customers to make unplanned, impulsive purchases.</li>
<li>It should influence the customers’ buying behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Store Layout Formats</h3>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Clear and adequate walking space, separate from product display area.</p></li>
<li><p>Free standing displays: Fixtures, rotary displays, or mannequins installed to attract customers’ attention and bring them to the store.</p></li>

<h1>Retail Management - Pricing</h1>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i>The bitterness of poor quality remains a long after low price is forgotten.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><i><b>&minus; Leon M. Cautillo</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We as customers, often get to read advertisements from various retailers saying, “Quality product for right price!” This leads to following questions such as what is the right price and who sets it? What are the factors and strategies that determine the price for what we buy?</p>
<p>The core capability of the retailers lies in pricing the products or services in a right manner to keep the customers happy, recover investment for production, and to generate revenue.</p>
<h2>What is Retail Pricing?</h2>
<p>The price at which the product is sold to the end customer is called the retail price of the product. Retail price is the summation of the manufacturing cost and all the costs that retailers incur at the time of charging the customer.</p>
<h2>Factors Influencing Retail Prices</h2>
<p>Retail prices are affected by internal and external factors.</p>
<h3>Internal Factors</h3>
<p>Internal factors that influence retail prices include the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Manufacturing Cost</b> &minus; The retail company considers both, fixed and variable costs of manufacturing the product. The fixed costs does not vary depending upon the production volume. For example, property tax. The variable costs include varying costs of raw material and costs depending upon volume of production. For example, labor.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The Predetermined Objectives</b> &minus; The objective of the retail company varies with time and market situations. If the objective is to increase return on investment, then the company may charge a higher price. If the objective is to increase market share, then it may charge a lower price.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Image of the Firm</b> &minus; The retail company may consider its own image in the market. For example, companies with large goodwill such as Procter & Gamble can demand a higher price for their products.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Product Status</b> &minus; The stage at which the product is in its product life cycle determines its price. At the time of introducing the product in the market, the company may charge lower price for it to attract new customers. When the product is accepted and established in the market, the company increases the price.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Promotional Activity</b> &minus; If the company is spending high cost on advertising and sales promotion, then it keeps product price high in order to recover the cost of investments.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>External Factors</h3>
<p>External prices that influence retail prices include the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Competition</b> &minus; In case of high competition, the prices may be set low to face the competition effectively, and if there is less competition, the prices may be kept high.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Buying Power of Consumers</b> &minus; The sensitivity of the customer towards price variation and purchasing power of the customer contribute to setting price.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Government Policies</b> &minus; Government rules and regulation about manufacturing and announcement of administered prices can increase the price of product.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Market Conditions</b> &minus; If market is under recession, the consumers buying pattern changes. To modify their buying behavior, the product prices are set less.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Levels of Channels Involved</b> &minus; The retailer has to consider number of channels involved from manufacturing to retail and their expectations. The deeper the level of channels, the higher would be the product prices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Demand-Oriented Pricing Strategy</h2>
<p>The price charged is high if there is high demand for the product and low if the demand is low. The methods employed while pricing the product on the basis of demand are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Price Skimming</b> &minus; Initially the product is charged at a high price that the customer is willing to pay and then it decreases gradually with time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Odd Even Pricing</b> &minus; The customers perceive prices like 99.99, 11.49 to be cheaper than 100.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Penetration Pricing</b> &minus; Price is reduced to compete with other similar products to allow more customer penetration.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Prestige Pricing</b> &minus; Pricing is done to convey quality of the product.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Price Bundling</b> &minus; The offer of additional product or service is combined with the main product, together with special price.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost-Oriented Pricing Strategy</h2>
<p>A method of determining prices that takes a retail company’s profit objectives and production costs into account. These methods include the following &minus;</p>
<p><b>Cost plus Pricing</b> &minus; The company sets prices little above the manufacturing cost. For example, if the cost of a product is Rs. 600 per unit and the marketer expects 10 per cent profit, then the selling price is set to Rs. 660.</p>
<p><b>Mark-up Pricing</b> &minus; The mark-ups are calculated as a percentage of the selling price and not as a percentage of the cost price.</p>
<p>The formula used to determine the selling price is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Selling Price = Average unit cost/Selling price
</pre>
<p><b>Break-even Pricing</b> &minus; The retail company determines the level of sales needed to cover all the relevant fixed and variable costs. They break-even when there is neither profit nor loss.</p>
<p>For example, Fixed cost = Rs. 2, 00,000, Variable cost per unit = Rs. 15, and Selling price = Rs. 20.</p>
<p>In this case, the company needs to sell (2,00, 000 / (20-15)) = 40,000 units to break even the fixed cost. Hence, the company may plan to sell at least 40,000 units to be profitable. If it is not possible, then it has to increase the selling price.</p>
<p>The following formula is used to calculate the break-even point &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Contribution = Selling price – Variable cost per unit
</pre>
<p><b>Target Return Pricing</b> &minus; The retail company sets prices in order to achieve a particular Return On Investment (ROI).</p>
<p>This can be calculated using the following formula &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Target return price = Total costs + (Desired % ROI investment)/Total sales in units
</pre>
<p>For example, Total investment = Rs. 10,000,</p>
<p>Desired ROI = 20 per cent,</p>
<p>Total cost = Rs.5000, and</p>
<p>Total expected sales = 1,000 units</p>
<p>Then the target return price will be Rs. 7 per unit as shown below &minus;</p>
<p>Target Return Price = (5000 + (20% * 10,000))/ 1000 = Rs. 7</p>
<p>This method ensures that the price exceeds all costs and contributes to profit.</p>
<p><b>Early Cash Recovery Pricing</b> &minus; When market forecasts depict short life, it is essential for the price sensitive product segments such as fashion and technology to recover the investment. Sometimes the company anticipates the entry of a larger company in the market. In these cases, the companies price their products to shorten the risks and maximize short-term profit.</p>
<h2>Competition-Oriented Pricing Strategy</h2>
<p>When a retail company sets the prices for its product depending on how much the competitor is charging for a similar product, it is competition-oriented pricing.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Competitor’s Parity</b> &minus; The retail company may set the price as close as the giant competitor in the market.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Discount Pricing</b> &minus; A product is priced at low cost if it is lacking some feature than the competitor’s product.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Differential Pricing Strategy</h2>
<p>The company may charge different prices for the same product or service.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Customer Segment Pricing</b> &minus; The price is charged differently for customers from different customer segments. For example, customers who purchase online may be charged less as the cost of service is low for the segment of online customers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Pricing</b> &minus; The retailer charges price depending upon time, season, occasions, etc. For example, many resorts charge more for their vacation packages depending on the time of year.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Location Pricing</b> &minus; The retailer charges the price depending on where the customer is located. For example, front-row seats of a drama theater are charged high price than rear-row seats.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
