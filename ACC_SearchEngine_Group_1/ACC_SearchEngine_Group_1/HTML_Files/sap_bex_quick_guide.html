<h1>SAP BEx - Architecture</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the architecture of SAP Business Explorer and how it can be integrated with SAP BusinessObjects.</p>
<h2>Business Explorer – Architecture</h2>
<p>SAP Business Explorer consists of multiple tools that can be used to design queries and to perform report analysis, create web applications. The BEx Web Analyzer, Report Designer and Query Designer uses BI content in SAP NetWeaver BW system and communication happens using BI Consumer Service also called as BICS.</p>
<p>The content developed using Business Explorer can be published in the <b>NetWeaver Portal</b> or can also be used in Composite Applications.</p>
<p>The following image shows the functional area/ basic architecture of SAP Business Explorer suite &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture" />
<h3>Components in SAP BEx Architecture</h3>
<p>At the bottom, you have SAP NetWeaver BI content in the BW system. The BI Content is managed in the form of OLAP Cubes from InfoProviders. An InfoCube is defined as a multidimensional dataset which is used for analysis in a BEx query. An InfoCube consists of a set of relational tables which are logically joined to implement the star schema.</p>
<p>You can add data from one or more InfoSource or InfoProviders to an InfoCube. They are available as InfoProviders for analysis and reporting purposes.</p>
<h3>BI Consumer Service (BICS)</h3>
<p>BICS is used to connect the Business Explorer queries to SAP NetWeaver BW system.  While creating an OLAP connection in IDT, you can use BICS connectivity to connect to the SAP BW system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/bics.jpg" alt="BIC S" />
<p>The next in line is SAP Business Explorer Suite that contains multiple tools to perform query analysis and design and for Report formatting. The Web Application Development (WAD) can be used for application development and content can be published on to the portal or composite applications using Broadcasting Information.</p>
<p>The BEx Analyzer provides an option for excel integration and you can analyze selected InfoProvider data and use it for planning by navigating in queries created in a BEx Query Designer.</p>
<p>At the top, you have the presentation layer that is used to publish the objects that are created using SAP Business Explorer. The NetWeaver Portal can be used for publishing the project or you can also use them in composite applications or analyze further using Microsoft Excel.</p>
<h2>Business Explorer  – Integration with BO</h2>
<p>You can integrate SAP Business Warehouse system with SAP BusinessObjects, then the use of Business Explorer increases in terms of reporting and querying options. SAP BusinessObjects provide a complete set of Analytical reporting, Dashboard and Data Visualization tools.</p>
<p>The following integrations can be performed &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can integrate SAP BusinessObjects Dashboard (Xcelsius) tool to create an interactive dashboard on top of the BI Content in the SAP BW server.</p></li> 
<li><p>It is also possible to integrate a Crystal Report with BW that can be used to generate form based data on top of the BW content which can be used for printing purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible to call Web Applications created using BEx Web Application Designer in SAP BusinessObjects BI Launchpad and to store and publish them into a BO repository server.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To integrate a SAP BW system to BusinessObjects tools, you can create a BICS connection to the BEx query. You can select a Cube while creating an OLAP connection using the BICS connection.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/integration_bo.jpg" alt="Integration BO" />
<h1>SAP BEx - Query Designer</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss what a Query Designer is and understand its functions. We will also learn how to create new queries.</p>
<h2>Business Explorer – BEx Query Designer Overview</h2>
<p>With the BEx Query Designer you can analyze the BI Content by combining characteristics and key figures along with other query elements. You can pass different parameters- hierarchies, variables, text and formulas in the query.</p>
<p>Filters can be applied in the query to restrict the data returned for the query. You can also insert query in workbook and that has been shown in the BEx Analyzer.</p>
<p>To open the BEx Query Designer, navigate to the Business Explorer &rarr; Query Designer &rarr; Run.</p>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/new_query.jpg" alt="New Query" />
<p>The next step is to make the selection screen for all the InfoProviders that you can define in a new query.</p>
<p>In the history tab, you can see all the recently used InfoProviders. From all the available InfoProviders under InfoAreas, select the InfoProvider that you want to use. You can also search for an InfoProvider in History or under InfoAreas.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/infoareas.jpg" alt="InfoAreas" />
<p>Once you add the InfoProvider, it is added to the InfoProvider pane. The list of all the available objects are then shown in their hierarchical structure. Drag the characteristics that you want to add to the Character Restrictions.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/character_restrictions.jpg" alt="Character Restrictions" />
<p>Note that the filter screen area contains empty directories for the filter selection and the Rows/Columns screen area contains empty directories for the rows, the columns, and the free characteristics of the query.</p>
<p>The preview of the results area for the query can be found at the bottom right of the screen.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/filter.jpg" alt="Filter" />
<p>The filter selection has a restricting effect on BEx query. All the data from the InfoProvider is aggregated with the filter selection.</p>
<p>You can also add the default values to the filter. You can double click on any of the characteristics and it will open a new window to make the default value selection.</p>

<p>In the Query Designer, you can save the filter locally or reuse in any other context. To save the filter locally, you can save the query.</p>
<p>To reuse the filter, you need to define a technical name and description of the filter.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/reusing.jpg" alt="Reusing" />
<p>In a similar way, you can also save and reuse other objects in a Business Explorer. The following objects can be saved and reused &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Query Views</li>
<li>Data Providers</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
<li>Reusable Web Items</li>
<li>Workbooks</li>
<li>Broadcast Settings</li>
<li>Dashboards</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn in detail about the accessibility mode in SAP Business Explorer.</p>
<h1>SAP BEx - Accessibility Mode</h1>
<p>To perform data analysis, you need to use the BEx Analyzer and you can add the data in a workbook. When you use the Web Applications, you can activate user profiles in the Portal configuration.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/portal.jpg" alt="Portal" />
<p>To show and hide the filter in a workbook area, you can use following keyboard shortcuts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Filter: ALT + F</li> 
<li>Information: ALT + I</li>
</ul>
<p>In a filter, you can also define filter conditions. The following functions can be performed using key combinations as shown below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Display key/text: CTRL + SHIFT + P</li>
<li>Settings: CTRL + SHIFT + E</li>
<li>Move to the beginning CTRL + SHIFT + T</li>
<li>Move up: CTRL + SHIFT + U</li>
<li>Move down: CTRL + SHIFT + N</li>
<li>Move to the end: CTRL + SHIFT + L</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define variables in a query and different key functions can be performed in a variable dialog box.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Save variant: CTRL + S</li>
<li>Save as new variant: CTRL + A</li>
<li>Deleting variants: CTRL + D</li>
<li>Attributes: CTRL + P</li>
<li>Display Object Name as: CTRL + R</li>
<li>Personalize Variables: CTRL + E</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn in detail about the various Broadcasting Options in SAP Business Explorer.</p>
<h1>SAP BEx - Information Broadcasting</h1>
<p>Using broadcasting options in Business Explorer, you can make BEx objects available to a wide range of users. You can pre-calculate a workbook, web templates, reports and query views and broadcast them in an email to the NetWeaver Portal. These documents can be shared in different formats like HTML, MHTML and other formats, whereas you can also share the URL and online links.</p>
<p>You can call a BEx broadcaster from different Business Explorer tools.</p>
<h2>Calling Broadcaster from Query Designer</h2>
<p>To call a BEx broadcaster from a Query designer, navigate to Publish &rarr; BEx Broadcaster.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/calling.jpg" alt="Calling" />
<h2>Calling Broadcaster from a Web Application Designer</h2>
<p>You can view the list of all broadcast settings for the web application. In a Web Application Toolbar, navigate to Web Template &rarr; Publish &rarr; BEx Broadcaster.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/web_application_design.jpg" alt="Web Application Design" />
<h2>Calling Broadcaster in Analyzer</h2>
<p>To view the Broadcaster settings, navigate to BEx Analyzer analysis toolbar, choose Tools &rarr; Broadcaster.</p>
<p>The BEx Broadcaster displays a list of the available broadcast settings for the workbook that you edited in the BEx Analyzer.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/broadcaster_in_analyzer.jpg" alt="Broadcaster in Analyzer" />
<h1>SAP BEx - Integration With BO</h1>
<p>You can also integrate all BEx objects with SAP BusinessObjects tools. When you integrate BEx with BO tools, it broadens the scope for reporting and data analysis. You can perform the following integration with SAP BusinessObjects &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Integration with SAP BO Dashboards</li>
<li>Integration with SAP Crystal Reports</li>
<li>Integration with SAP BusinessObjects Analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you open any of the BusinessObjects tools, you have an option to consume BEx Query to create a BI Report or Dashboard. You can use the existing queries in the Query Designer and can also create new queries in the BEx Query Designer tool.</p>
<p>Open SAP Crystal Report Designer to integrate with the BEx Query. Navigate to Data Source &rarr; Select BEx Query.</p>
<p>To connect to a Data source, go to File &rarr; New &rarr; from the Data Source.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/data_source.jpg" alt="Data Source" />
<p>You can also connect to other SAP BusinessObjects tools to connect to BEx Query and you can import the characteristics and key figures to create dashboards and BI reports.</p>
<p>To connect the Dashboard to the BEx Query, you need to navigate to the Query Browser &rarr; Add Query &rarr; Select BEx.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/add_query.jpg" alt="Add Query" />
<p>Next is to select the connection &rarr; Search for BEx Query that you should use based on the InfoProvider to use in the BO Tool.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bex/images/search.jpg" alt="Search" />
<p>This is how you can connect SAP BusinessObjects tools to BEx Objects.</p>
