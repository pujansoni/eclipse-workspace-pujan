<p>It is the standard theme of Fiori applications and comes with a new color palette and icons which are better scalable.</p>
<p>The background texture has a stroke pattern in white and light blue with a gradient layer.</p>
<p>As it replaces Corbu with Blue Crystal, this integrates SAP GUI for Windows 7.40 and NWBC 5.0</p>
<h3>Complete icons redesign for Blue Crystal</h3>
<p>All SAP GUI icons used by SAP applications have been redesigned and are now fitting the Blue Crystal Design. Additionally, they are much better scalable than before. The new set of icons is exclusive to Blue Crystal Design.</p>

<h1>SAP Basis - GUI Selection</h1>
<p>As mentioned, there are three different GUIs available and we can select the right version based on the requirement. The following scenario can help you find a suitable SAP GUI &minus;</p>
<h3>When users are working rarely in the SAP system</h3>
<p>Suppose most of the users fall in this category, then it is suggested to use SAP GUI for HTML format. This allows you to save effort and money for client deployment.</p>
<h3>When users are working mostly in the SAP system</h3>
<p>In a case such as this, SAP GUI for Win dows or SAP GUI for Java is recommended.</p>
<h3>When users are ABAP developers</h3>
<p>For ABAP developers, it is recommended that they use SAP GUI for Windows.</p>
<h3>When users use operating systems other than Microsoft</h3>
<p>It is recommended they use SAP GUI for Java and HTML or they can use the SAP GUI for Windows on a remote server.</p>
<h3>When users are integrating Dynpro transactions to the Portal</h3>
<p>It is recommended they use SAP GUI for HTML. This allows you to integrate classic Dynpro-based applications into the portal easily.</p>
<h2>SAP Instance and SID</h2>
<p>A SAP instance is when you install and configure a SAP system. This instance defines a group of resources — memory, processors and other resources in the system. This allows users to login to the SAP system and share the same resources.</p>
<p>SAP instance is managed by CCMS. Users can login to the SAP system using an instance.</p>
<p>A SAP system can consist of one or more instances — you can set up a SAP system with a single instance with only one CCMS or you can configure a system with two or more separate instances in client/server environment.</p>
<h3>Configuring a SAP instance</h3>
<p>You need to follow these steps to configure a SAP instance &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; You need to define separate directories for UNIX, AS/400, or Microsoft Windows NT server on which the instance is to run.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; You can use a shared file system.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; For each instance, there are entries created in operating system configuration files (/etc/services, /etc/sapconfig…).</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; There are communication entries created in the host.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; For each instance, start and system profiles are created.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; For each instance, operating system users are installed.</p>
<h3>Creating an instance for one server</h3>
<p>You need to follow these steps to create an instance for one server &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To create an instance, you should first define the mode of operation.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; To create an instance, go to CCMS > Configuration or use Transaction code RZ04.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Go to instances/operation modes as shown in shown in the screenshots below.</p>

<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; If the application server is not running, you should use the input help to display the possible entries and fill the below values.</p>
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Enter the host name and choose current settings. If the application server is already running, the system will display the current settings for that instance. However, if the application server is not yet running, you should use the input help to display the possible entries and fill in the following fields&minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_maintain_instance.jpg" alt="SAP Maintain Instance" />
<h2>SAP System Number</h2>
<p>The SAP System Number is the number that is mentioned when the SAP System is installed.</p>
<p><b>Start Profile</b> &minus; Profile Name</p>
<p>Insert the name of the start profile from Profiles to start the instance. You can also click on “choose the input help” to display a list of available start profiles. You can select a profile from the available list.</p>
<p><b>Instance Profile</b> &minus; Profile Name</p>
<p>You have to select the name of instance profile from Profiles to run the instance. You can click on “input help” to display a list of available instance profiles.</p>
<p>To save the instance, click on Save button at the top &gt; Continue</p>
<h2>Maintaining Instance Definition</h2>
<p>When you define operation modes, you need to maintain instance definition. Follow these steps to change the definition &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Use Transaction Code: RZ04.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Select Instances/operation mode</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select an entry from the list of productive instances.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; You can then change the data for that instance.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_operation_modes.jpg" alt="SAP Operation Modes" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; You can also delete an instance, operation mode using the same transaction code.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; To delete an operation mode — From the list of productive operation modes, position the cursor on a line with the operation mode. Select operation mode &gt; Delete. This deletes the operation mode, and all the instances and work process definitions assigned to it.</p>
<h1>System Landscape &amp; Architecture</h1>
<p>SAP system landscape is defined as an arrangement of SAP servers. Ideally, in a Sap environment, a three-system landscape exists. A system landscape consists of Development Server (Dev), Production Server (PROD), and Quality Assurance server (QAS).</p>
<p>SAP Architecture is defined as a technology framework of SAP system and it changes with time unlike the system landscape. SAP Architecture changes with new software like SAP ECC 6.0, the most recent one.</p>
<p>The following is a request in SAP System Landscape &minus;</p>
<p><b>DEVELOPMENT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quality &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>The following figure represents SAP three tier system landscape where work flows from Dev &gt; QAS &gt; PROD and not in backward direction.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_three_tire_system.jpg" alt="SAP Three Tire System" />
<p>Let us now discuss the system landscape &minus;</p>
<h3>Sandbox Server</h3>
<p>When a project is implemented, at the initial stages, a sandbox server is used where all the customization, configuration is performed.</p>
<h3>Development Server</h3>
<p>Next is to save the configuration in development server and saved in workbench requests and this has to be transported to Production server.</p>
<h3>Production Server</h3>
<p>You can consider it as the final or the most refined stage where the work is done when project is in production/go live. All the changes that are required by the client are performed in the DEV environment and later, the request is transported to production.</p>
<h2>SAP System 3 – Tier Architecture</h2>
<p>The image given below shows 3-tier architecture of the SAP system. The <b>presentation layer</b> is the topmost one. This contains the device/application to control the SAP system. This can include mobile devices, end user systems or SAP GUI or web browser based client.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/3_tier_architecture.jpg" alt="3-Tire Architecture" />
<p>The presentation layer communicates with the application server to perform all the processing and which is known as brains of an SAP system.</p>
<p>An application server consists of multiple instances and communicates with the database layer of the three-tier architecture.</p>
<p>The bottom layer is called the <b>database layer</b>. This is responsible to store all the data. The database of SAP system is kept on a separate server for performance and security reasons.</p>
<p>The presentation layer consists of different components for ABAP and JAVA that enables the communication and processing of data in SAP system.</p>
<p>The key components of the presentation layer include the following &minus;</p>
<p><b>Message Server</b> &minus; This is used to manage communication between distributed dispatchers in the ABAP system.</p>
<p><b>Message Server</b> &minus; This is used to manage server processes and JAVA dispatchers. It is used to manage communication within JRE.</p>
<p><b>Dispatcher Queue</b> &minus; This is used to store multiple work process types.</p>
<p><b>Dispatcher</b> &minus; This is used to distribute the requests to the work processes.</p>
<p><b>Memory Pipes</b> &minus; This is used to manage communication between ICM and ABAP work processes.</p>
<p><b>Enqueue Server</b> &minus; This is used to handle logical locks set by the executed Java application program.</p>
<p><b>Java Dispatcher</b> &minus; This is responsible to receive the client requests via presentation layer and forward to the server process.</p>
<p><b>Gateway</b> &minus; This is used to manage communication between SAP system and external systems.</p>
<p><b>ABAP Work processes</b> &minus; This separately executes dialog steps in R/3 applications separately.</p>

<li>Password complexity and other such aspects need to be considered too.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following parameters are used to define system password policy &minus;</p>
<p><b>login/min_password_lng</b></p>
<p>This is used to define minimum password length. The default value for this field is 3 characters and can be set to any value between 3 and 8.</p>
<p><b>login/password_expiration_time</b></p>
<p>This parameter is used to define the number of days after which a password expires. To allow users to keep their password from expiring without any limit, set the default value to 0.</p>
<h2>Limit Users on Password Selection</h2>
<p>You can also select the password which you don’t want users to choose. These passwords are maintained in table USR40 and transaction code SM30 is used for this purpose.</p>
<p>There are two wildcard characters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>?- stands for a single character.</li>
<li>*- stands for a sequence of any combination characters of any length.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you select <b>123*</b> in table USR40, it means that any password that begins with the sequence "123." is prohibited.</p>
<p>If you enter <b>*123*</b>, it prohibits any password that contains the sequence "123."</p>
<p>If you select <b>AB?</b>, passwords that begin with "AB" and an additional character will not be allowed. For example — "ABB", "ABF", etc.</p>

<h1>SAP Basis - Managing Transports</h1>
<h2>Transport Management System Overview (TMS)</h2>
<p>Transport Management System is one of the key components in SAP system. TMS is used to control new requests, monitor changes like who has implemented the changes, defining and configuring system landscape in SAP environment.</p>
<p>TMS consists of 3 different Change and Transport System (CTS) components &minus;</p>
<h3>Change and Transport Organizer (CTO)</h3>
<p>Transaction Code — SE01</p>
<p>This is used to manage, configure the changes in SAP repository and other objects. This provides you a central environment for development and configuration projects.</p>
<h3>Transport Management System (TMS)</h3>
<p>This is used to manage, control and copy development objects and for customization of settings across SAP systems in landscape using pre-defined transport routes configured with RFC Connections. This includes exporting the objects from one SAP system and importing to another target system.</p>
<h3>Transport Tools</h3>
<p>Tools are a part of SAP Kernel and are used to manage R3 trans and transport control program.</p>
<p>R3trans is known as SAP system transport which is used to transport the objects between different SAP systems. It is usually called for other transport control program, in particular from tp or by using SAP upgrade utilities.</p>
<p>Transport control program is used to support data and object transport between different systems running on different platforms and also on different database.</p>
<h2>Configuring Transport Management</h2>
<p>Transport management is one of the key components in SAP system landscape and is used to perform the following activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Defining Transport Domain Controller.</li>
<li>Configuring the SAP system landscape.</li>
<li>Defining the Transport Routes among systems within the system Landscape.</li>
<li>Distributing the configuration</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transport Domain Controller</h3>
<p>This is used to manage all TMS configuration details. Any changes to configuration settings are distributed across all systems. To set up the Domain controller, use transaction code — STMS</p>
<p>In case, the SAP system doesn’t have a Domain Controller, you will be prompted to create a new one. Transport domain includes the following activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>User creation TMSADM</li>
<li>RFC connection and request creation, TMSADM is used login to target system</li>
<li>DOMAIN.CFG file is created under usr/sap/trans/bin directory which stores TMS configuration and is used by systems and domains for checking existing configurations.</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/transport_management_system.jpg" alt="Transport Management System" />
<p>Follow these steps to add a system to Transport domain &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Log on to the SAP system, that you want to add as a System, in client 000 and enter the transaction code — STMS. If system is not added, TMS will check configuration file DOMAIN.CFG and will prompt you to create one. Click on — <b>Select the Proposal and Save</b>. The system will remain in ‘Waiting’ status initially.</p>
<p>To complete the task&#8594; login to the Domain Controller System &#8594; Transaction STMS &#8594; Go to Overview &#8594; Systems.</p>
<p>You can now see that a new system is available. Go to SAP System &#8594; Approve</p>

<h1>SAP Basis - Managing Transport Routes</h1>
<p>Transport routes are defined as routes that are defined by a SAP Administrator to transmit the changes between different SAP systems.</p>
<p>The following are the two types of transport routes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Consolidation</b> (From DEV to QAS) — Transport Layers are used</p></li>
<li><p><b>Delivery</b> (From QAS to PRD) — Transport Layers not required</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Transport Request</h2>
<p>This contains a number of changes to be implemented in the development system. It consists of the types of changes, purpose, change category, target system and other details.</p>
<p>Transport request are named in a standard format like <b>&lt;SID&gt;K&lt;Number&gt;</b></p>
<p>For example, in <b>&lt;SID&gt;K&lt;Number&gt;</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SID represents System ID</li>
<li>K stands for fixed keyword/alphabet</li>
<li>Number can be anything from a range starting with 900001</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two type of request types that can be created in the SAP system &minus;</p>
<h3>Workbench Request</h3>
<p>This request type contains the repository objects and cross-client customizing objects. Workbench requests are used to make changes in the ABAP workbench objects.</p>
<h3>Customizing Request</h3>
<p>This request type contains objects that belong to ‘client-specific’ customizing. These requests are created in system automatically when a user performs customizing setting and a target system is automatically assigned as per the transport layer.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/transport_organizer.jpg" alt="Transport Organizer" />
<p>To create a Transport Request, use transaction code — SE01</p>
<p>A Transport Request can be created in the following two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Automatic</b> &minus; This way you can create or modify an object, or perform customizing settings. Here, the system displays the 'Dialog box' for creating a transport request or mention name of an already created request, if available.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Manual</b> &minus; This way you can create the transport request from the Transport Organizer, and then enter required attributes and insert objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/organizer_extended_view.jpg" alt="Organizer Extended View" />
<h2>Import / Export of Objects</h2>
<p>Once transport request is completed in the source system, you have to export the request from the source system and import it to the target system. To perform the import, you have to select an import queue.</p>
<p>Transaction STMS &#8594; Import or you can go to Overviews tab at the top &#8594; Imports</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_overview.jpg" alt="SAP Overview" />
<p>You can see a list of systems in the current domain, description and a number of requests available in <b>Import Queue</b> and the status.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/import_overview.jpg" alt="Import Overview" />
<h3>Import a Queue</h3>
<p>This list contains Transport Requests in the common directory. These requests are ready to be imported to the target system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/import_queues.jpg" alt="Import Queues" />
<p>To add a request manually, you can go to other requests &#8594; Add (you should know the name of Transport request).</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/other_requests.jpg" alt="Other Requests" />
<h2>Transport Request Logs</h2>
<p>You can also check the logs once the transport request is completed. To check the logs, use transaction code — SE01 &#8594; GoTo &#8594; Transport Logs</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/extended_view.jpg" alt="Extended View" />
<p>There are two types of logs available in Transport Management System &minus;</p>
<h3>Transport Logs</h3>
<p>It keeps track of the transport log files that have been moved in a Transport Request.</p>
<h3>Action Log</h3>
<p>It includes the details of all the actions that have been performed in a Transport Request. Actions such as exports, import, etc.</p> 
<p>One of the important functions provided by the logs are the following return codes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>0</b> &minus; This value represents that export was successful.</p></li>
<li><p><b>4</b> &minus; This value represents that a warning was issued and the objects were transported successfully.</p></li>
<li><p><b>8</b> &minus; This value represents that a warning was issued and at least one object could not be transported.</p></li>
<li><p><b>12 or higher</b> &minus; This value represents an error in transport request and it is generally not caused by the objects in Transport Request. This probably occurs because of system failure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Basis - Patch Management</h1>

<h2>Support Packages and Add-ons</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, support packages are used to fix the bug and to improve the quality of SAP system. Support package implementation and administration is done with Transaction Spam (Support Package Manager). Each support package is valid for one release and Support Package Manager ensures that all support packages are applied in a specified order.</p>
<p>Support packs are applied in the above mentioned order — Basis &gt; ABAP &gt; HR &gt; Applications. It is not necessary that Basis and ABAP patch levels should be same but SAP recommends that they should be at the same level. Generally, Basis and ABAP should be applied together however to apply one first, it should be Basis.</p>
<p>All support packs are applied with client 000. Support packages should be imported at regular intervals to avoid errors and to keep system landscape up to date.</p>
<p>There are different types of support packages available &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>SPAM Update</b> &minus; A SPAM Update contains updates and improvements to Support Package Manager (SPAM) and Add-On Installation Tool.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Component Support Package</b> &minus; This contains improvement for one software component such as SAP Basis, SAP HR or SAP APPLICATIONS and to update repository and dictionary objects.</p></li>

<h2>Requirements to Implement Support Package</h2>
<p>A support package is always implemented on client 000 and user should have an authorization equivalent to DDIC or SAP.</p>
<p>To implement a support package, use transaction code — SPAM. You can check if any previous package is in progress or is incomplete. If there is an incomplete support package, you can’t proceed with the implementation of a new one.</p>
<p><b>Note &minus; Transport directory /usr/sap/trans should have enough space.</b></p>
<h3>Support Package and Stack Update</h3>
<p>You can download support package from SAP Service Market place. Open the link — service.sap.com and login with your SID.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_service.jpg" alt="SAP Service" />
<p>Go to SAP Support Portal from the dropdown &#8594; Software Downloads</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_marketplace.jpg" alt="SAP Marketplace" />

<p>Download the support package and save in OS level Transport directory /usr/sap/trans</p>
<p>Uncompress the file- sapcar –xvf &lt;support package name&gt;</p>
<p>You can see .ATT and .PAT files in Transport directory.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/att_and_pat.jpg" alt="ATT and PAT" />
<p>To load the support package from application Server, use transaction code — SPAM. Support Package &#8594; Load Packages &#8594; From Application Server</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_spam.jpg" alt="SAP SPAM" />
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/load_packages.jpg" alt="Load Packages" />
<p>Or you can also load it from Front End in case it is &lt; 10 MB. The support packages which are in the form of .car will be decompressed into eps/in directory.</p>
<p>If the size of the Support Package is greater than 10mb, then copy the support packages to /trans directory as above and uncompress to .ATT and .PAT files.</p>
<h3>SPAM Update</h3>
<p>You can also update Support Package Manager and Add-on installation tool. This should be performed before any support package upgrade.</p>

<h1>SAP Basis - Kernel Upgrade and Patching</h1>
<p>Kernel is an executable program that exists between SAP Applications and Operating System. It consists of executable program under the path — "/sapmnt/&lt;SID&gt;/exe" for UNIX and \usr\sap\SID\SYS\exe\run Windows. It starts and stops application services such as message server, dispatcher, etc.</p>
<p>In Kernel upgrade, new .exec files replace old executable files in SAP system. To check the current version, use transaction code — SM51 &gt; Go to Release Notes.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/server_list.jpg" alt="Server List" />
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_information.jpg" alt="SAP Information" />

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/kernel_version.jpg" alt="Kernel Versions" />
<h2>Upgrade Kernel Version</h2>
<p>Let us now follow these steps to upgrade the Kernel version &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Create a directory with enough disk space and enter the name of directory.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Copy the upgrade files SAPEXEDB.SAR & SAPEXE.SAR files to the new directory at OS level.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; To check directory, use 'pwd' to ensure you are in the same directory.</p>
<p><b>STep 4</b> &minus; Now, uncompress .SAR files by sapcar exe.</p>
<p>SAPCAR –xvf sapexe.SAR</p>
<p>SAPCAR –xvf sapexedb.SAR</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sapcar.jpg" alt="SAPCAR" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; To take backup of existing Kernel, you have to create one more directory with the name "exe_old&lt;ddmmyy&gt;" and take backup of existing Kernel file.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; To perform upgrade, stop the SAP application. You don’t need to shut down the database for Kernel upgrade but you need to stop the SAP application using this command — stopsap r3.</p>
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Copy the files from the new kernel directory exe_new&lt;ddmmyy &#8594; to the existing kernel directory exe.</p>
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Use this command to copy — cp -rp /sapmnt/&lt;SID&gt;/exe_new&lt;ddmmyy&gt;/* /sapmnt/&lt;SID&gt;/exe/</p>
<p><b>Step 9</b> &minus; Now if you check the current Kernel version using disp+work, then check the kernel version from OS level by the command <b>disp+work &minus; versions</b> and new patch version should be displayed.</p>
<p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; Login to the operating system as root specific to UNIX. Execute the script in Kernel directory — ./saproot.sh &lt;SID&gt;</p>
<p>You use this to assign correct permissions to all the executable programs in the kernel such as br* file etc.</p>
<p><b>Step 11</b> &minus; Start SAP Applications using this command — startsap r3.</p>
<p><b>Step 12</b> &minus; If you run Transaction SM52, you can see current kernel version level.</p>

<h1>SAP Basis - Remote Function Call</h1>
<h2>What is RFC?</h2>
<p>To communicate between SAP systems, there is a need to define a mechanism. One of the most common ways is to define Remote Function Call (RFC Connection) between two systems. By creating a trusted RFC connection between two systems, it allows you to create <b>trusted-trusting relationship between systems</b> wherein, you can communicate and exchange information and data.</p>
<p>There are different types of trusted RFC connections.</p>
<h3>Type 3 Connection</h3>
<p>This connection type is used to specify connection between ABAP systems. Here, you need to mention the host name and IP address of source system and also the logon information. This is applicable for both type of RFCs, between ABAP systems and external calls to ABAP systems.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/remote_logon.jpg" alt="Remote Logon" />
<h3>Type I Connection</h3>
<p>This connection type is used to specify ABAP systems connected to the same data base as the current system. Let us take an example entry name — ws0015_K18_24</p>
<p>ws0015=host name</p>
<p>K18=system name (data base name)</p>
<p>24=TCP-service name</p>
<h3>Type T Connection</h3>
<p>This connection type helps connect destinations to external programs that use the RFC API to receive RFCs. This can be activated using start or registration.</p>
<h1>SAP Basis - RFC Between SAP ECC &amp; HANA</h1>
<h2>Creating a Trusted RFC between SAP ECC and HANA</h2>
<p>Suppose, you want to set up a trusted RFC towards target system BB1 on your source SAP system AA1. With the completion of the setup, you would be logged onto AA1 and your user would have enough authorization in BB1; you can use the RFC connection and logon to BB1 without having to re-enter username and password.</p>
<p>Using RFC trusted/trusting relationship between two SAP systems, RFC from a trusted system to a trusting system, password is not required for logging on to the trusting system.</p>
<p>Open SAP ECC system using SAP logon. Enter transaction code SM59 &#8594; this is the transaction code to create a new Trusted RFC connection &#8594; Click on the 3rd icon to open a new connection wizard &#8594; click on Create and a new window will open.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/sap_ecc.jpg" alt="SAP ECC" />
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/configuration_rfc.jpg" alt="Configuration" />
<p>RFC Destination ECCHANA (Enter name of RFC destination) Connection Type — 3 (for ABAP system)</p>
<p>Go to Technical Setting.</p>
<p>Enter target host — ECC system name, IP and enter system number.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/connection_type.jpg" alt="/connection Type" />
<p>Go to Logon & Security Tab, Enter Language, Client, ECC system username and password.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/test_rfc_sap.jpg" alt="Test RFC SAP" />
<p>Click on the Save option at the top.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/destination.jpg" alt="Destination" />
<p>Click on Test Connection to successfully test the connection.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/rfc_connection_test.jpg" alt="RFC Connection Test" />
<h2>Configuring RFC Connection</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to configure RFC connection &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Run transaction — ltr (to configure RFC connection) &#8594; New browser will open&#8594; Enter ECC system username and password and logon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/monitoring_dashboard.jpg" alt="Monitoring" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click on New &#8594; New Window will open &#8594; Enter configuration name &#8594; Click Next &#8594; Enter RFC Destination (connection name created earlier), Use search option, Choose name and click Next.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_basis/images/create_configuration.jpg" alt="Create Configuration" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; In Specify Target system, Enter HANA system admin username & password, host name, Instance number and click Next. Enter number of data transfer jobs like 007 (it can’t be 000) &#8594; Next &#8594; Create Configuration.</p>
<h2>Testing Trusted RFC</h2>

<h1>SAP Basis - New Dimensional Product</h1>
<h2>Introduction to BI / BW</h2>
<p>SAP BI/BW is a data warehousing product and is based on SAP ABAP infrastructure. It is used to convert raw data into reports. This can also be used to build analytical reports and for decision making by business managers.</p>
<p>Using a Business Warehouse, you can combine data from different heterogeneous sources, organize and manage the data for detailed reporting.</p>
<p>This data warehousing product can easily be integrated with different SAP reporting tools. This product can help to analyze multidimensional data from different sources.</p>
<p>The key components in SAP NetWeaver Business Intelligence are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (BW)</li>
<li>SAP Business Explorer (SAP BEx) and</li>
<li>SAP NetWeaver BW Accelerator (BWA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides replicating data from the source to the SAP NetWeaver BW system, it is also possible to access the source data directly from the SAP NetWeaver BW system using <b>Virtual Providers</b>. The analytic engine provides methods and services for analysis, planning and generic services such as caching and security.</p>
<p>SAP Business Explorer BEx is used to define how data is displayed. This tool also supports the creation of Excel-based and web-based applications for analysis, planning, and reporting. The BEx applications created with the BEx tools can be integrated into the SAP Enterprise Portal. Integration with SAP BusinessObjects tools offers further options for analysis and reporting in addition to the standard SAP BEx functions. You can access BI information (like reports, analysis and dashboards) with the SAP BusinessObjects BI Portal InfoView.</p>

<h2>Basis Integration with ECC</h2>
<p>SAP ERP is based on SAP NetWeaver version. For example, SAP ERP 6.0 is based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0. SAP ERP is also based on enhancement packages; for example, ERP 6.0 is based on EHP04 and NetWeaver Enhancement Package — EHP01.</p>
<p>The software components always follow product numbering like SAP HR 6.04 belongs to Enhancement Package 4 for SAP ERP 6.0 and SAP BASIS 7.01 belongs to EHP01 for SAP NetWeaver 7.0.</p>
<p>Likewise,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>SAP ECC 6.0 Enhancement Package 5 is based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 Enhancement Package 02</p></li>
<li><p>ECC 6.0 Enhancement Package 4 is based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 Enhancement Package 01</p></li>
<li><p>ECC 6.0 Enhancement Package 6 is based on SAP NetWeaver 7.0 Enhancement Package 03</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation of an EHP for ECC involves the application of SAP NetWeaver EHP (starting with ECC EHP 4).</p>
