<h1>Data Analysis - Overview</h1>
<p>Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions and supporting decision-making</p>.  
<h2>Types of Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Several data analysis techniques exist encompassing various domains such as business, science, social science, etc. with a variety of names. The major data analysis approaches are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list"> 
<li>Data Mining</li>
<li>Business Intelligence</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis</li>
<li>Predictive Analytics</li>
<li>Text Analytics</li>
</ul>  
<h3>Data Mining</h3>
<p>Data Mining is the analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns of data, unusual data and the dependencies. Note that the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data and not the extraction of data itself.</p>
<p>Data mining analysis involves computer science methods at the intersection of the artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems.</p>
<p>The patterns obtained from data mining can be considered as a summary of the input data that can be used in further analysis or to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system.</p> 
<h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
<p>Business Intelligence techniques and tools are for acquisition and transformation of large amounts of unstructured business data to help identify, develop and create new strategic business opportunities.</p>
<p>The goal of business intelligence is to allow easy interpretation of large volumes of data to identify new opportunities. It helps in implementing an effective strategy based on insights that can provide businesses with a competitive market-advantage and long-term stability.</p> 
<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>Statistics is the study of collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.</p> 
<p>In data analysis, two main statistical methodologies are used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Descriptive statistics</b> &minus; In descriptive statistics, data from the entire population or a sample is summarized with numerical descriptors such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Mean, Standard Deviation for Continuous Data</p></li> 
<li><p>Frequency, Percentage for Categorical Data</p></li>
</ul>
</li> 
<li><p><b>Inferential statistics</b> &minus; It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the represented population or  accounting for randomness. These inferences can be &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>answering yes/no questions about the data (hypothesis testing)</p></li> 
<li><p>estimating numerical characteristics of the data (estimation)</p></li>
<li><p>describing associations within the data (correlation)</p></li> 
<li><p>modeling relationships within the data (E.g. regression analysis)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Predictive Analytics</h3>
<p>Predictive Analytics use statistical models to analyze current and historical data for forecasting (predictions) about future or otherwise unknown events. In business, predictive analytics is used to identify risks and opportunities that aid in decision-making.</p>  
<h3>Text Analytics</h3>
<p>Text Analytics, also referred to as Text Mining or as Text Data Mining is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text, deriving patterns within the structured data using means such as statistical pattern learning, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output.</p> 
<h3>Data Analysis Process</h3>
<p>Data Analysis is defined by the statistician John Tukey in 1961 as "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.”</p>
<p>Thus, data analysis is a process for obtaining large, unstructured data from various sources and converting it into information that is useful for &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Answering questions</li>
<li>Test hypotheses</li>
<li>Decision-making</li>
<li>Disproving theories</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Data Analysis with Excel</h2>
<p>Microsoft Excel provides several means and ways to analyze and interpret data. The data can be from various sources. The data can be converted and formatted in several ways. It can be analyzed with the relevant Excel commands, functions and tools - encompassing Conditional Formatting, Ranges, Tables, Text functions, Date functions, Time functions, Financial functions, Subtotals, Quick Analysis, Formula Auditing, Inquire Tool, What-if Analysis, Solvers, Data Model, PowerPivot, PowerView, PowerMap, etc.</p>  
<p>You will be learning these data analysis techniques with Excel as part of two parts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data Analysis with Excel and</li>
<li>Advanced Data Analysis with Excel</li>
</ul>
<h1>Data Analysis - Process</h1>
<p>Data Analysis is a process of collecting, transforming, cleaning, and modeling data with the goal of discovering the required information. The results so obtained are communicated, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data visualization is at times used to portray the data for the ease of discovering the useful patterns in the data. The terms Data Modeling and Data Analysis mean the same.</p>
<p>Data Analysis Process consists of the following phases that are iterative in nature &minus;</p>
<ul class="list"> 
<li>Data Requirements Specification</li>
<li>Data Collection</li>
<li>Data Processing</li>
<li>Data Cleaning</li>
<li>Data Analysis</li>
<li>Communication</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/data_analysis_process.jpg" alt="Data Analysis Process" />
<h2>Data Requirements Specification</h2>
<p>The data required for analysis is based on a question or an experiment. Based on the requirements of those directing the analysis, the data necessary as inputs to the analysis is identified (e.g., Population of people). Specific variables regarding a population (e.g., Age and Income) may be specified and obtained. Data may be numerical or categorical.</p> 
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>Data Collection is the process of gathering information on targeted variables identified as data requirements. The emphasis is on ensuring accurate and honest collection of data. Data Collection ensures that data gathered is accurate such that the related decisions are valid. Data Collection provides both a baseline to measure and a target to improve.</p> 
<p>Data is collected from various sources ranging from organizational databases to the information in web pages. The data thus obtained, may not be structured and may contain irrelevant information. Hence, the collected data is required to be subjected to Data Processing and Data Cleaning.</p>
<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>The data that is collected must be processed or organized for analysis. This includes structuring the data as required for the relevant Analysis Tools. For example, the data might have to be placed into rows and columns in a table within a Spreadsheet or Statistical Application. A Data Model might have to be created.</p> 
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>The processed and organized data may be incomplete, contain duplicates, or contain errors. Data Cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors.  There are several types of Data Cleaning that depend on the type of data. For example, while cleaning the financial data, certain totals might be compared against reliable published numbers or defined thresholds. Likewise, quantitative data methods can be used for outlier detection that would be subsequently excluded in analysis.</p> 
<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Data that is processed, organized and cleaned would be ready for the analysis. Various data analysis techniques are available to understand, interpret, and derive conclusions based on the requirements. Data Visualization may also be used to examine the data in graphical format, to obtain additional insight regarding the messages within the data.</p> 
<p>Statistical Data Models such as Correlation, Regression Analysis can be used to identify the relations among the data variables. These models that are descriptive of the data are helpful in simplifying analysis and communicate results.</p> 
<p>The process might require additional Data Cleaning or additional Data Collection, and hence these activities are iterative in nature.</p>  
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>The results of the data analysis are to be reported in a format as required by the users to support their decisions and further action. The feedback from the users might result in additional analysis.</p> 
<p>The data analysts can choose data visualization techniques, such as tables and charts, which help in communicating the message clearly and efficiently to the users. The analysis tools provide facility to highlight the required information with color codes and formatting in tables and charts.</p>
<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Overview</h1>
<p>Excel provide commands, functions and tools that make your data analysis tasks easy. You can avoid many time consuming and/or complex calculations using Excel. In this tutorial, you will get a head start on how you can perform data analysis with Excel. You will understand with relevant examples, step by step usage of Excel commands and screen shots at every step.</p>
<h2>Ranges and Tables</h2>
<p>The data that you have can be in a range or in a table. Certain operations on data can be performed whether the data is in a range or in a table.</p>
<p>However, there are certain operations that are more effective when data is in tables rather than in ranges. There are also operations that are exclusively for tables.</p>
<p>You will understand the ways of analyzing data in ranges and tables as well. You will understand how to name ranges, use the names and manage the names. The same would apply for names in the tables.</p>
<h2>Data Cleaning – Text Functions, Dates and Times</h2>
<p>You need to clean the data obtained from various sources and structure it before proceeding to data analysis. You will learn how you can clean the data.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>With Text Functions</li>
<li>Containing Date Values</li>
<li>Containing Time Values</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conditional Formatting</h2>
<p>Excel provides you conditional formatting commands that allow you to color the cells or font, have symbols next to values in the cells based on predefined criteria. This helps one in visualizing the prominent values. You will understand the various commands for conditionally formatting the cells.</p> 
<h2>Sorting and Filtering</h2>
<p>During the preparation of data analysis and/or to display certain important data, you might have to sort and/or filter your data. You can do the same with the easy to use sorting and filtering options that you have in Excel.</p>
<h2>Subtotals with Ranges</h2>
<p>As you are aware, PivotTable is normally used to summarize data. However, Subtotals with Ranges is another feature provided by Excel that will allow you to group / ungroup data and summarize the data present in ranges with easy steps.</p> 
<h2>Quick Analysis</h2>
<p>With Quick Analysis tool in Excel, you can quickly perform various data analysis tasks and make quick visualizations of the results.</p>
<h2>Understanding Lookup Functions</h2>
<p>Excel Lookup Functions enable you to find the data values that match a defined criteria from a huge amount of data.</p>
<h2>PivotTables</h2>
<p>With PivotTables you can summarize the data, prepare reports dynamically by changing the contents of the PivotTable.</p>
<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p>You will learn several Data Visualization techniques using Excel Charts. You will also learn how to create Band Chart, Thermometer Chart, Gantt chart, Waterfall Chart, Sparklines and PivotCharts.</p>
<h2>Data Validation</h2>
<p>It might be required that only valid values be entered into certain cells. Otherwise, they may lead to incorrect calculations. With data validation commands, you can easily set up data validation values for a cell, an input message prompting the user on what is expected to be entered in the cell, validate the values entered with the defined criteria and display an error message in case of incorrect entries.</p>
<h2>Financial Analysis</h2>
<p>Excel provides you several financial functions. However, for commonly occurring problems that require financial analysis, you can learn how to use a combination of these functions.</p>
<h2>Working with Multiple Worksheets</h2>
<p>You might have to perform several identical calculations in more than one worksheet. Instead of repeating these calculations in each worksheet, you can do it one worksheet and have it appear in the other selected worksheets as well. You can also summarize the data from the various worksheets into a report worksheet.</p> 
<h2>Formula Auditing</h2>
<p>When you use formulas, you might want to check whether the formulas are working as expected. In Excel, Formula Auditing commands help you in tracing the precedent and dependent values and error checking.</p>    
<h2>Inquire</h2>
<p>Excel also provides Inquire add-in that enables you compare two workbooks to identify changes, create interactive reports, and view the relationships among workbooks, worksheets, and cells. You can also clean the excessive formatting in a worksheet that makes Excel slow or makes the file size huge.</p>
<h1>Working with Range Names</h1>
<p>While doing Data Analysis, referring to various data will be more meaningful and easy if the reference is by Names rather than cell references – either a single cell or a range of cells. For example, if you are calculating Net Present Value based on a Discount Rate and a series of Cash Flows, the formula</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Net_Present_Value = NPV (Discount_Rate, Cash_Flows)</b></p>
<p>is more meaningful than</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">C10 = NPV (C2, C6:C8)</p>
<p>With Excel, you can create and use meaningful names to various parts of your data. The advantages of using range names include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A meaningful Range name (such as Cash_Flows) is much easier to remember than a Range address (such as C6:C8).</p></li>
<li><p>Entering a name is less error prone than entering a cell or range address.</p></li>
<li><p>If you type a name incorrectly in a formula, Excel will display a <b>#NAME?</b> error.</p></li>
<li><p>You can quickly move to areas of your worksheet by using the defined names.</p></li>
<li><p>With Names, your formulas will be more understandable and easier to use. For example, a formula Net_Income = Gross_Income – Deductions is more intuitive than C40 = C20 – B18.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating formulas with range names is easier than with cell or range addresses. You can copy a cell or range name into a formula by using formula Autocomplete.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Syntax rules for names.</li>
<li>Creating names for cell references.</li>
<li>Creating names for constants.</li>
<li>Managing the names.</li>
<li>Scope of your defined names.</li>
<li>Editing names.</li>
<li>Filtering names.</li>
<li>Deleting names.</li>
<li>Applying names.</li>
<li>Using names in a formula.</li>
<li>Viewing names in a workbook.</li>
<li>Using paste names and paste list.</li>
<li>Using names for range intersections.</li>
<li>Copying formulas with names.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Copying Name using Formula Autocomplete</h2>
<p>Type the first letter of the name in the formula. A drop-down box appears with function names and range names. Select the required name. It is copied into your formula.</p>
<img src="images/copying_name.jpg" alt="Copying Name" />
<h2>Range Name Syntax Rules</h2>
<p>Excel has the following syntax rules for names &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can use any combination of letters, numbers and the symbols - underscores, backslashes, and periods. Other symbols are not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>A name can begin with a character, underscore or backslash.</p></li>
<li><p>A name cannot begin with a number (example - 1stQuarter) or resemble a cell address (example - QTR1).</p></li>
<li><p>If you prefer to use such names, precede the name with an underscore or a backslash (example - \1stQuarter, _QTR1).</p></li>
<li><p>Names cannot contain spaces. If you want to distinguish two words in a name, you can use underscore (example- Cash_Flows instead of Cash Flows)</p></li>
<li><p>Your defined names should not clash with Excel’s internally defined names, such as <b>Print_Area, Print_Titles, Consolidate_Area, and Sheet_Title</b>. If you define the same names, they will override the Excel’s internal names and you will not get any error message. However, it is advised not to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the names short but understandable, though you can use up to 255 characters</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Range Names</h2>
<p>You can create Range Names in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the <b>Name box</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <b>New Name</b> dialog box.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <b>Selection</b> dialog box.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Create a Range Name using the Name Box</h3>
<p>To create a Range name, using the <b>Name</b> box that is to the left of formula bar is the fastest way. Follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Select the range for which you want to define a Name.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click on the Name box.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Type the name and press Enter to create the Name.</p>
<img src="images/creating_range_names.jpg" alt="Creating Range Names" />
<h3>Create a Range Name using the New Name dialog box</h3>
<p>You can also create Range Names using the New Name dialog box from Formulas tab.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Select the range for which you want to define a name.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the Formulas tab.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Click Define Name in the Defined Names group. The <b>New Name</b> dialog box appears.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Type the name in the box next to Name</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Check that the range that is selected and displayed in the Refers box is correct. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/creating_range_name_using_new_name.jpg" alt="Creating Range Name Using New Name" />
<h3>Create a Range Name using the Create Names from Selection dialog box</h3>
<p>You can also create Range names using the <b>Create Names</b> from the Selection dialog box from Formulas tab, when you have Text values that are adjacent to your range.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Select the range for which you want to define a name along with the row / column that contains the name.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the Formulas tab.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Click <b>Create from Selection</b> in the Defined Names group. The <b>Create Names from Selection</b> dialog box appears.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Select top row as the Text appears in the top row of the selection.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Check the range that got selected and displayed in the box next to Refers to be correct. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/create_from_selection.jpg" alt="Create from Selection" />
<p>Now, you can find the largest value in the range with =<b>Sum</b>(Student Name), as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/find_largest_value.jpg" alt="Find Largest Value" />
<p>You can create names with multiple selection also. In the example given below, you can name the row of marks of each student with the student’s name.</p>
<img src="images/create_names_with_multiple_selection.jpg" alt="Create Names with Multiple Selection" />
<p>Now, you can find the total marks for each student with =<b>Sum</b> (student name), as shown
below.</p>
<img src="images/find_total_marks.jpg" alt="Find Total Marks" />
<h2>Creating Names for Constants</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a constant that will be used throughout your workbook. You can assign a name to it directly, without placing it in a cell.</p>
<p>In the example below, Savings Bank Interest Rate is set to 5%.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click Define Name.</li>
<li>In the New Name dialog box, type Savings_Bank_Interest_Rate in the Name box.</li>
<li>In Scope, select Workbook.</li>
<li>In Refers to box, clear the contents and type 5%.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/creating_names_for_constants.jpg" alt="Creating Names for Constants" />
<p>The Name <b>Savings_Bank_Interest_Rate</b> is set to a constant 5%. You can verify this in Name Manager. You can see that the value is set to 0.05 and in the <b>Refers to</b> =0.05 is placed.</p>
<img src="images/name_manager.jpg" alt="Name Manager" />
<h2>Managing Names</h2>
<p>An Excel Workbook can have any number of named cells and ranges. You can manage these names with the Name Manager.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Formulas tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Name Manager</b> in the <b>Defined Names</b> group. The <b>Name Manager</b> dialog box appears. All the names defined in the current workbook are displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/managing_names.jpg" alt="Managing Names" />
<p>The List of <b>Names</b> are displayed with the defined <b>Values, Cell Reference</b> (including Sheet Name), <b>Scope</b> and <b>Comment</b>.</p>
<p>The Name Manager has the options to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Define a <b>New</b> Name with the <b>New</b> Button.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Edit</b> a Defined Name.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Delete</b> a Defined Name.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Filter</b> the Defined Names by Category.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the Range of a Defined Name that it <b>Refers to</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/name_manager_options.jpg" alt="Name Manager Options" />
<h2>Scope of a Name</h2>
<p>The <b>Scope</b> of a name by default is the workbook. You can find the <b>Scope</b> of a defined names from the list of names under the <b>Scope</b> column in the <b>Name Manager</b>.</p>
<p>You can define the <b>Scope</b> of a <b>New Name</b> when you define the name using <b>New Name</b> dialog box. For example, you are defining the name Interest_Rate. Then you can see that the <b>Scope</b> of the <b>New Name</b> Interest_Rate is the <b>Workbook</b>.</p>
<img src="images/scope_of_a_name.jpg" alt="Scope of a Name" />
<p>Suppose you want the <b>Scope</b> of this interest rate restricted to this <b>Worksheet</b> only.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Click the down-arrow in the Scope Box. The available Scope options appear in the drop-down list.</p>
<img src="images/scope.jpg" alt="Scope" />
<p>The Scope options include <b>Workbook</b>, and the sheet names in the workbook.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the current worksheet name, in this case NPV and click OK. You can define / find the sheet name in the worksheet tab.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; To verify that Scope is worksheet, click <b>Name Manager</b>. In the Scope column, you will find NPV for Interest_Rate. This means you can use the Name Interest_Rate only in the
Worksheet NPV, but not in the other Worksheets.</p>
<img src="images/verify_scope.jpg" alt="Verify Scope" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Once you define the Scope of a Name, it cannot be modified later.</p>
<h2>Deleting Names with Error Values</h2>
<p>Sometimes, it may so happen that Name definition may have errors for various reasons. You can delete such names as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Click <b>Filter</b> in the <b>Name Manager</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>The following filtering options appear &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Clear Filter</li>
<li>Names Scoped to Worksheet</li>
<li>Names Scoped to Workbook</li>
<li>Names with Errors</li>
<li>Names without Errors</li>
<li>Defined Names</li>
<li>Table Names</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply <b>Filter</b> to the <b>defined Names</b> by selecting one or more of these options.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Select <b>Names with Errors</b>. Names that contain error values will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/names_with_errors.jpg" alt="Names with Errors" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; From the obtained list of <b>Names</b>, select the ones you want to delete and click <b>Delete</b>.</p>
<img src="images/names_list.jpg" alt="Names List" />
<p>You will get a message, confirming delete. Click OK.</p>
<h2>Editing Names</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>Edit</b> option in the <b>Name Manager</b> dialog box to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Change the <b>Name</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the <b>Refers to</b> range</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the <b>Comment</b> in a <b>Name</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Change the Name</h3>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Click the cell containing the function <b>Large</b>.</p>
<p>You can see, two more values are added in the array, but are not included in the function as they are not part of Array1.</p>
<img src="images/change_name.jpg" alt="Change Name" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the <b>Name</b> you want to edit in the <b>Name Manager</b> dialog box. In this case, <b>Array1</b>.</p>

<img src="images/scope_deactivated.jpg" alt="Scope Deactivated" />
<p>Click OK. You will observe the changes made.</p>
<img src="images/cell_changed.jpg" alt="Cell Changed" />
<h2>Applying Names</h2>
<p>Consider the following example &minus;</p>
<img src="images/applying_names.jpg" alt="Applying Names" />
<p>As you observe, names are not defined and used in PMT function. If you place this function somewhere else in the worksheet, you also need to remember where exactly the parameter values are. You know that using names is a better option.</p>
<p>In this case, the function is already defined with cell references that do not have names. You can still define names and apply them.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Using <b>Create from Selection</b>, define the names.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Select the cell containing the formula. Click <img class="inline" src="images/select_button.jpg" alt="Select Button" /> next to <b>Define Name</b> in the <b>Defined Names</b> group on the <b>Formulas</b> tab. From the drop-down list, click <b>Apply Names</b>.</p>
<img src="images/select_cell.jpg" alt="Select Cell" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; The <b>Apply Names</b> dialog box appears. Select the <b>Names</b> that you want to <b>Apply</b> and click OK.</p>
<img src="images/apply_names.jpg" alt="Apply Names" />
<p>The selected names will be applied to the selected cells.</p>
<img src="images/selected_cells.jpg" alt="Selected Cells" />
<p>You can also <b>Apply Names</b> to an entire worksheet, by selecting the worksheet and repeating the above steps.</p>
<h2>Using Names in a Formula</h2>
<p>You can use a <b>Name</b> in a <b>Formula</b> in the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Typing the <b>Name</b> if you remember it, or</p></li>
<li><p>Typing first one or two letters and using the <b>Excel Formula Autocomplete</b> feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking Use in Formula in the Defined Names group on the Formulas tab.</p>
<ul class="list">

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/using_names_in_formula.jpg" alt="Using Names in a Formula" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the <b>Paste Name</b> dialog box.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the Paste Names option from the drop-down list of defined names. The
Paste Name dialog box appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <b>Name</b> in the <b>Paste Names</b> dialog box and double-click it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_name.jpg" alt="Select Name" />
<h2>Viewing Names in a Workbook</h2>
<p>You can get all the <b>Names</b> in your workbook along with their <b>References</b> and <b>Save</b> them or <b>Print</b> them.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click an empty Cell where you want to copy the <b>Names</b> in your workbook.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Use in Formula</b> in the <b>Defined Names</b> group.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Paste Names</b> from the drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Paste List</b> in the <b>Paste Name</b> dialog box that appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/viewing_names.jpg" alt="Viewing Names" />
<p>The list of names and their corresponding references are copied at the specified location on your worksheet as shown in the screen shot given below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/worksheet.jpg" alt="Worksheet" />
<h2>Using Names for Range Intersections</h2>
<p><b>Range Intersections</b> are those individual cells that have two Ranges in common.</p>
<p>For example, in the data given below, the Range B6:F6 and the Range C3:C8 have Cell C6 in common, which actually represents the marks scored by the student Kodeda, Adam in Exam 1.</p>
<img src="images/range_intersections.jpg" alt="Range Intersections" />
<p>You can make this more meaningful with the <b>Range Names</b>.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create <b>Names</b> with <b>Create from Selection</b> for both Students and Exams.</p></li>
<li><p>Your <b>Names</b> will look as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/range_names.jpg" alt="Range Names" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Type =<b>Kodeda_Adam Exam_1</b> in B11.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, you are using the Range Intersection operation, space between the two ranges.</p>
<img src="images/range_intersection_operation.jpg" alt="Range Intersection operation" />
<p>This will display marks of Kodeda, Adam in Exam 1, that are given in Cell C6.</p>
<img src="images/display_marks.jpg" alt="Display Marks" />
<h2>Copying Formulas with Names</h2>
<p>You can copy a formula with names by <b>Copy</b>and <b>Paste</b> within the same worksheet.</p>
<p>You can also copy a formula with names to a different worksheet by <b>copy</b> and <b>paste</b>, provided all the <b>names</b> in the <b>formula</b> have <b>workbook</b> as <b>Scope</b>. Otherwise, you will get a <b>&#35;VALUE</b> error.</p>
<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Tables</h1>
<p>A <b>Table</b> is a rectangular range of structured data. The key features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Each row in the table corresponds to a single record of the data. Example - Employee information.</p></li>
<li><p>Each column contains a specific piece of information. Exmaple - The columns can contain data such as name, employee number, hire date, salary, department, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The top row describes the information contained in each column and is referred to as header row.</p></li>
<li><p>Each entry in the top row is referred to as column header.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/table.jpg" alt="Table" />
<p>You can create and use an Excel table to manage and analyze data easily. Further, with Excel Tables you get built-in Filtering, Sorting, and Row Shading that ease your reporting activities.</p>
<p>Further, Excel responds to the actions performed on a table intelligently. For example, you have a formula in a column or you have created a chart based on the data in the table. When you add more data to the table (i.e., more rows), Excel extends the formula to the new data and the chart expands automatically.</p>
<h2>Difference between Tables and Ranges</h2>
<p>Following are the differences between a table and range &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A table is a more structured way of working with data than a range.</li>
<li>You can convert a range into a table and Excel automatically provides &minus;
<ul class="list">
<li>a Table Name</li>
<li>Column Header Names</li>
<li>Formatting to the Data (Cell Color and Font Color) for better Visualization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tables provide additional features that are not available for ranges. These are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Excel provides table tools in the ribbon ranging from properties to styles.</p></li>
<li><p>Excel automatically provides a Filter button in each column header to sort the data or filter the table such that only rows that meet your defined criteria are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have multiple rows in a table, and you scroll down the sheet so that the header row disappears, the column letters in the worksheet are replaced by the table headers.</p></li>
<li><p>When you place a formula in any cell in a column of the table, it gets propagated to all the cells in that column.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use table name and column header names in the formulas, without having to use cell references or creating range names.</p></li>
<li><p>You can extend the table size by adding more rows or more columns by clicking and dragging the small triangular control at the lower-right corner of the lower-right cell.</p></li>
<li><p>You can create and use slicers for a table for filtering data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn about all these Features in this Chapter.</p>
<h2>Create Table</h2>
<p>To create a table from the data you have on the worksheet, follow the given steps &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Select the Range of Cells that you want to include in the Table. Cells can contain data or can be empty. The following Range has 290 rows of employee data. The top row of the data has headers.</p>
<img src="images/create_table.jpg" alt="Create Table" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Under the <b>Insert</b> tab, in the Tables group, click Tables. The <b>Create Table</b> dialog box appears. Check that the data range selected in the <b>Where is the data for your table?</b> Box is correct.</p>
<img src="images/insert_tab.jpg" alt="Insert Tab" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Check the <b>My table has headers</b> box if the top row of the selected Range contains data that you want to use as the Table Headers.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; If you do not check this box, your table will have Headers – Column1, Column2, …</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/create_table_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Create Table Dialog Box" />
<p>Range is converted to Table with the default Style.</p>
<img src="images/table_with_default_size.jpg" alt="Table with Default Size" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; You can also convert a range to a table by clicking anywhere on the range and pressing Ctrl&plus;T. A <b>Create Table</b> dialog box appears and then you can repeat the steps as given above.</p>
<h2>Table Name</h2>
<p>Excel assigns a name to every table that is created.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To look at the name of the table you just created, click table, click on <b>table tools – design</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; In the <b>Properties</b> group, in the <b>Table Name</b> box, your Table Name will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/table_name_box.jpg" alt="Table Name Box" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; You can edit this Table Name to make it more meaningful to your data.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Click the Table Name box. Clear the Name and type Emp_Data.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The syntax rules of range names are applicable to table names.</p>
<img src="images/syntax_rules_applicable.jpg" alt="Syntax Rules Applicable" />
<h2>Managing Names in a Table</h2>
<p>You can manage table names just similar to how you manage range names with Name Manager.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Table.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Name Manager</b> in the <b>Defined Names</b> group on <b>Formulas</b> tab.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Name Manager</b> dialog box appears and you can find the <b>Table Names</b> in your workbook.</p>
<img src="images/managing_names_in_table.jpg" alt="Managing Names in Table" />
<p>You can <b>Edit</b> a <b>Table Name</b> or add a comment with <b>New</b> option in the <b>Name Manager</b> dialog box. However, you cannot change the range in <b>Refers to</b>.</p>
<img src="images/edit_table_name.jpg" alt="Edit Table Name" />
<p>You can <b>Create Names</b> with column headers to use them in formulas, charts, etc.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Column Header <b>EmployeeID</b> in the Table.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Name Manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>New</b> in the Name Manager dialog box.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>New Name</b> dialog box appears.</p>
<p>In the Name box, you can find the Column Header, and in the <b>Refers to</b> box,you will find <b>Emp_Data[[#Headers],[EmployeeID]]</b>.</p>
<img src="images/name_box.jpg" alt="Name Box" />
<p>As you observe, this is a quick way of defining Names in a Table.</p>
<h2>Table Headers replacing Column Letters</h2>
<p>When you are working with more number of rows of data in a table, you may have to scroll down to look at the data in those rows.</p>
<p>However, while doing so, you also require the table headers to identify which value belongs to which column. Excel automatically provides a smooth way of doing this. As you scroll down your data, the column letters of the worksheet themselves get converted to table headers.</p>
<p>In the worksheet given below, the column letters are appearing as they are and the table headers are in row 2. 21 rows of 290 rows of data are visible.</p>
<img src="images/column_letters.jpg" alt="Column Letters" />
<p>Scroll down to see the table rows 25 – 35. The table headers will replace the column letters for the table columns. Other column letters remain as they are.</p>
<img src="images/column_letters_replaced.jpg" alt="Column Letters Replaced" />
<h2>Propagation of a Formula in a Table</h2>
<p>In the table given below, suppose you want to include the age of each employee.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Insert a column to the right of the column Birthdate. Type Age in the Column Header.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; In any of the Cells in that empty column, type the Formula, =<b>DAYS ([&commat;BirthDate], TODAY ())</b> and Press Enter.</p>
<img src="images/formula_propagation.jpg" alt="Formula Propagation" />
<p>The formula propagates automatically to the other cells in that column of the table.</p>
<img src="images/formula_propagates_automatically.jpg" alt="Formula Propagates Automatically" />
<h2>Resize Table</h2>
<p>You can resize a table to add or remove rows/columns.</p>
<p>Consider the following table Student_Marks that contains Total Marks for Batches 1 - 15.</p>
<img src="images/resize_table.jpg" alt="Resize Table" />
<p>Suppose you want to add three more batches 16 – 18 and a column containing pass percentage.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the table.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the blue-color control at the lower-right, downwards to include three more rows in the table.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/add_batches.jpg" alt="Add Batches" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Again drag the blue-color control at the lower-right, sideways to include one more column in the table.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your table looks as follows. You can also check the range included in the table in the Name Manager dialog box &minus;</p>
<img src="images/check_range.jpg" alt="Check Range" />
<h2>Remove Duplicates</h2>
<p>When you gather data from different sources, you probably can have duplicate values. You need to remove the duplicate values before going further with analysis.</p>
<p>Look at the following data where you have information about various products of various brands. Suppose, you want to remove duplicates from this data.</p>
<img src="images/remove_duplicates.jpg" alt="Remove Duplicates" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the table.</p></li>
<li><p>On the <b>DESIGN</b> tab, click <b>Remove Duplicates</b> in the Tools group on the Ribbon. The <b>Remove Duplicates</b> dialog box appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/design_tab.jpg" alt="Design Tab" />
<p>The column headers appear under columns in the Remove Duplicates dialog box.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Check the column headers depending on which column you want to remove the duplicates and click OK.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will get a message on how many rows with duplicate values are removed and how many unique values remain. The cleaned data will be displayed in the table.</p>

<h1>Cleaning Data with Text Functions</h1>
<p>The data that you obtain from different sources many not be in a form ready for analysis. In this chapter, you will understand how to prepare your data that is in the form of text for analysis.</p>
<p>Initially, you need to clean the data. Data cleaning includes removing unwanted characters from text. Next, you need to structure the data in the form you require for further analysis. You can do the same by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Finding required text patterns with the text functions.</li>
<li>Extracting data values from text.</li>
<li>Formatting data with text functions.</li>
<li>Executing data operations with the text functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Removing Unwanted Characters from Text</h2>
<p>When you import data from another application, it can have nonprintable characters and/or excess spaces. The excess spaces can be &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>leading spaces, and/or</li>
<li>extra spaces between words.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you sort or analyze such data, you will get erroneous results.</p>
<p>Consider the following example &minus;</p>
<img src="images/product_data.jpg" alt="Product Data" />
<p>This is the raw data that you have obtained on product information containing the Product ID, Product description and the price. The character “&#x7c” separates the field in each row.</p>
<p>When you import this data into Excel worksheet, it looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/import_data.jpg" alt="Import Data" />
<p>As you observe, the entire data is in a single column. You need to structure this data to perform data analysis. However, initially you need to clean the data.</p>
<p>You need to remove any nonprintable characters and excess spaces that might be present in the data. You can use the CLEAN function and TRIM function for this purpose.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:5%">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Function &amp; Description</th>

<p>Removes spaces from text</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the Cells C3 – C11.</li>
<li>Type =TRIM (CLEAN (B3)) and then press CTRL &plus; Enter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The formula is filled in the cells C3 – C11.</p>

<img src="images/formula_filled_result.jpg" alt="Formula Filled Result" />
<h3>Finding required Text Patterns with the Text Functions</h3>
<p>To structure your data, you might have to do certain Text Pattern matching based on which you can extract the Data Values. Some of the Text Functions that are useful for this purpose are &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:5%">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Function &amp; Description</th>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3.</td>
<td><p><b>SEARCH</b></p>
<p>Finds one text value within another (not case-sensitive)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Extracting Data Values from Text</h2>
<p>You need to extract the required data from text in order to structure the same. In the above example, say, you need to place the data in three columns – ProductID, Product_Description and Price.</p>
<p>You can extract data in one of the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Extracting Data Values with Convert Text to Columns Wizard</li>
<li>Extracting Data Values with Text Functions</li>
<li>Extracting Data Values with Flash Fill</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extracting Data Values with Convert Text to Columns Wizard</h3>
<p>You can use the <b>Convert Text to Columns Wizard</b> to extract Data Values into Excel columns if your fields are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Delimited by a character, or</li>
<li>Aligned in columns with spaces between each field.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above example, the fields are delimited by the character “&#x7c;”. Hence, you can use the <b>Convert Text to Columns</b> wizard.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy and paste values in the same place. Otherwise, <b>Convert Text to Columns</b> takes the functions rather than the data itself as the input.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/convert_text_to_columns.jpg" alt="Convert Text to Columns" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b>Text to Columns</b> in the <b>Data Tools</b> group under <b>Data</b> Tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Convert Text to Columns Wizard - Step 1 of 3 appears.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select Delimited.</li>
<li>Click Next.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/convert_text_to_columns_step1.jpg" alt="Convert Text to Columns Step1" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Convert Text to Columns Wizard - Step 2 of 3 appears.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Under <b>Delimiters</b>, select <b>Other</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the box next to <b>Other</b>, type the character <b>&#x7c;</b></p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Next</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/convert_text_to_columns_step2.jpg" alt="Convert Text to Columns Step2" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Convert Text to Columns Wizard - Step 3 of 3 appears.</p>
<p>In this screen, you can select each column of your data in the wizard and set the format for that column.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>For <b>Destination</b>, select the cell D3.</p></li>
<li><p>You can click <b>Advanced</b>, and set <b>Decimal Separator</b> and <b>Thousands Separator</b> in the <b>Advanced Text Import Settings</b> dialog box that appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Finish</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/convert_text_to_columns_step3.jpg" alt="Convert Text to Columns Step3" />
<p>Your data, which is converted to columns appears in the three Columns – D, E and F.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Name the Column headers as ProductID, Product_Description and Price.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/name_column_headers.jpg" alt="Name Column Headers" />
<h3>Extracting Data Values with Text Functions</h3>
<p>Suppose the fields in your data neither are delimited by a character nor are aligned in columns with spaces between each field, you can use text functions to extract data values. Even in the case the fields are delimited, you can still use text functions to extract data.</p>
<p>Some of the text functions that are useful for this purpose are &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Function &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1.</td>
<td><p><b>LEFT</b></p>
<p>Returns the leftmost characters from a text value</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2.</td>
<td><p><b>RIGHT</b></p>
<p>Returns the rightmost characters from a text value</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3.</td>
<td><p><b>MID</b></p>
<p>Returns a specific number of characters from a text string starting at the position you specify</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">4.</td>
<td><p><b>LEN</b></p>
<p>Returns the number of characters in a text string</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You can also combine two or more of these text functions as per the data you have at hand, to extract the required data values. For example, using a combination of LEFT, RIGHT and VALUE functions or using a combination of FIND, LEFT, LEN and MID functions.</p>
<p>In the above example,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>All the characters left to the first &#x7c; give the name ProductID.</p></li>
<li><p>All the characters right to the second &#x7c; give the name Price.</p></li>
<li><p>All the characters that lie between the first &#x7c; and second &#x7c; give the name Product_Description.</p></li>
<li><p>Each &#x7c; has a space before and after.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Observing this information, you can extract the data values with the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Find the Position of First &#x7c; - <b>First &#x7c; Position</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can use FIND function</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>Find the Position of Second &#x7c; - <b>Second &#x7c; Position</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can use FIND function again</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>Beginning to (<b>First &#x7c; Position</b> – 2) Characters of the Text give ProductID</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can use LEFT Function</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>(<b>First &#x7c Position</b> &plus; 2) to (<b>Second &#x7c Position</b> - 2) Characters of the Text give Product_Description</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can use MID Function</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>(<b>Second &#x7c Position</b> &plus; 2) to End Characters of the Text give Price</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can use RIGHT Function</p></li>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<img src="images/extract_data_values.jpg" alt="Extract Data Values" />
<p>The result will be as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/extract_data_values_result.jpg" alt="Extract Data Values Result" />
<p>You can observe that the values in the price column are text values. To perform calculations on these values, you have to format the corresponding cells. You can look at the section given below to understand formatting text.</p>
<h3>Extracting Data Values with Flash Fill</h3>
<p>Using Excel <b>Flash Fill</b> is another way to extract data values from text. However, this works only when Excel is able to find a pattern in the data.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Create three columns for ProductID, Product_Description and Price next to the data.</p>
<img src="images/create_columns.jpg" alt="Create Columns" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Copy and paste the values for C3, D3 and E3 from B3.</p>
<img src="images/paste_values.jpg" alt="Paste Values" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select cell C3 and click <b>Flash Fill</b> in the <b>Data Tools</b> group on the <b>Data</b> tab. All the values for ProductID get filled.</p>
<img src="images/flash_fill.jpg" alt="Flash Fill" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Repeat the above given steps for Product_Description and Price. The data is filled.</p>
<img src="images/repeat_steps.jpg" alt="Repeat Steps" />

<h2>Date Formats</h2>
<p>Excel supports <b>Date</b> values in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Serial Format</li>
<li>In different Year-Month-Day Formats</li>
</ul>
<p>You can convert &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A <b>Date</b> in Serial Format to a <b>Date</b> in Year-Month-Day Format</p></li>
<li><p>A <b>Date</b> in Year-Month-Day Format to a <b>Date</b> in Serial Format</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Date in Serial Format</h3>
<p>A <b>Date</b> in serial format is a positive integer that represents the number of days between the given date and January 1, 1900. Both the current <b>Date</b> and January 1, 1900 are included in the count. For example, 42354 is a <b>Date</b> that represents 12/16/2015.</p>
<h3>Date in Month-Day-Year Formats</h3>
<p>Excel supports different <b>Date</b> Formats based on the <b>Locale</b> (Location) you choose. Hence, you need to first determine the compatibility of your <b>Date</b> formats and the Data Analysis at hand. Note that certain <b>Date</b> formats are prefixed with &ast;(asterisk) &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Date</b> formats that begin with &ast;(asterisk) respond to changes in regional date and time settings that are specified for the operating system</p></li>
<li><p><b>Date</b> formats without an &ast;(asterisk) are not affected by operating system settings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For understanding purpose, you can assume United States as the Locale. You find the following <b>Date</b> formats to choose for the <b>Date</b> - 8<sup>th</sup> June, 2016 &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>*6/8/2016 (affected by operating system settings)</li>
<li>*Wednesday, June 8, 2016 (affected by operating system settings)</li>
<li>6/8</li>
<li>6/8/16</li>
<li>06/08/16</li>
<li>8-Jun</li>
<li>8-Jun-16</li>
<li>08-Jun-16</li>
<li>Jun-16</li>
<li>June-16</li>
<li>J</li>
<li>J-16</li>
<li>6/8/2016</li>
<li>8-Jun-2016</li>
</ul>
<p>If you enter only two digits to represent a year and if &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The digits are 30 or higher, Excel assumes the digits represent years in the twentieth century.</p></li>
<li><p>The digits are lower than 30, Excel assumes the digits represent years in the twenty-first century.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, 1/1/29 is treated as January 1, 2029 and 1/1/30 is treated as January 1, 1930.</p>
<h2>Converting Dates in Serial Format to Month-Day-Year Format</h2>
<p>To convert dates from serial format to Month-Day-Year format, follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>Number</b> tab in the <b>Format Cells</b> dialog box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Date</b> under <b>Category</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Locale</b>. The available <b>Date</b> formats will be displayed as a list under <b>Type</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on a <b>Format</b> under <b>Type</b> to look at the preview in the box adjacent to <b>Sample</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/converting_dates_in_serial_format.jpg" alt="Converting Dates in Serial Format" />
<p>After choosing the Format, click <b>OK.</b></p>
<h2>Converting Dates in Month-Day-Year Format to Serial Format</h2>
<p>You can convert dates in Month-Day-Year format to Serial format in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using <b>Format Cells</b> dialog box</p></li>
<li><p>Using Excel <b>DATEVALUE</b> function</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Format Cells dialog box</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>Number</b> tab in the <b>Format Cells</b> dialog box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>General</b> under <b>Category</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/format_cells.jpg" alt="Format Cells" />
<h3>Using Excel DATEVALUE Function</h3>
<p>You can use Excel <b>DATEVALUE</b> function to convert a <b>Date</b> to <b>Serial Number</b> format. You need to enclose the <b>Date</b> argument in “”. For example,</p>
<p style="padding-left:25%">=DATEVALUE ("6/8/2016") results in 42529</p>
<h2>Obtaining Today's Date</h2>
<p>If you need to perform calculations based on today’s date, simply use the Excel function TODAY (). The result reflects the date when it is used.</p>
<p>The following screenshot of TODAY () function usage has been taken on 16<sup>th</sup> May, 2016 &minus;</p>
<img src="images/obtaining_todays_date.jpg" alt="Obtaining Today's Date" />
<h2>Finding a Workday after Specified Days</h2>
<p>You might have to perform certain calculations based on your workdays.</p>
<p>Workdays exclude weekend days and any holidays. This means if you can define your weekend and holidays, whatever calculations you do will be based on workdays. For example, you can calculate invoice due dates, expected delivery times, the next meeting date, etc.</p>
<p>You can use Excel <b>WORKDAY</b> and <b>WORKDAY.INTL</b> functions for such operations.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Function &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1.</td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2.</td>
<td><p><b>WORKDAY.INTL</b></p>
<p>Returns the serial number of the date before or after a specified number of workdays using parameters to indicate which and how many days are weekend days</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>For example, you can specify the 15<sup>th</sup> working day from today (the screenshot below is taken on 16<sup>th</sup> May 2016) using the Functions TODAY and WORKDAY.</p>
<img src="images/finding_workday.jpg" alt="Finding Workday" />
<p>Suppose 25<sup>th</sup> May 2016 and 1<sup>st</sup> June 2016 are holidays. Then, your calculation will be as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/calculation.jpg" alt="Calculation" />
<h2>Customizing the Definition of a Weekend</h2>
<p>By default, weekend is Saturday and Sunday, i.e. two days. You can also optionally define your weekend with the <b>WORKDAY.INTL</b> function. You can specify your own weekend by a weekend-number that corresponds to the weekend days as given in the table below. You need not remember these numbers, because when you start typing the function, you get a list of numbers and the weekend days in the drop-down list.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Weekend Days</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Weekend-number</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Saturday, Sunday</td>
<td>1 or omitted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sunday, Monday</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monday, Tuesday</td>
<td>3</td>

<p>Suppose, if weekend is Friday only, you need to use the number 16 in the WORKDAY.INTL function.</p>
<img src="images/workday_intl_function.jpg" alt="WORKDAY.INTL function" />
<h2>Number of Workdays between two given Dates</h2>
<p>There might be a requirement to calculate the number of workdays between two dates, for example, in the case of calculating payment to a contract employee who is paid on per day basis.</p>
<p>You can find the number of workdays between two dates with the Excel functions <b>NETWORKDAYS</b> and <b>NETWORKDAYS.INTL</b>. Just as in the case of WORKDAYS and WORKDAYS.INTL, NETWORKDAYS and NETWORKDAYS.INTL allow you to specify holidays and with NETWORKDAYS.INTL you can additionally specify the weekend.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2.</td>
<td><p><b>NETWORKDAYS.INTL</b></p>
<p>Returns the number of whole workdays between two dates using parameters to indicate which and how many days are weekend days</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You can calculate the number of workdays between today and another date with the functions TODAY and NETWORKDAYS. In the screen shot given below, today is 16<sup>th</sup> May 2016 and end date is 16<sup>th</sup> June 2016. 25<sup>th</sup> May 2016 and 1<sup>st</sup> June 2016 are holidays.</p>

<p>Again, the weekend is assumed to be Saturday and Sunday. You can have your own definition for weekend and calculate the number of workdays between two dates with the NETWORKDAYS.INTL function. In the screen shot given below, only Friday is defined as weekend.</p>
<img src="images/weekend_friday.jpg" alt="Weekend Friday" />
<h2>Extracting Year, Month, Day from Date</h2>
<p>You can extract from each date in a list of dates, the corresponding day, month and year using the excel functions DAY, MONTH and YEAR.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following dates &minus;</p>
<img src="images/dates.jpg" alt="Dates" />
<p>From each of these dates, you can extract day, month and year as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/extracting_year_month_day_from_date.jpg" alt="Extracting Year, Month, Day from Date" />
<h2>Extracting Day of the Week from Date</h2>
<p>You can extract from each date in a list of dates, the corresponding day of the week with Excel WEEKDAY function.</p>
<p>Consider the same example given above.</p>
<img src="images/extracting_day_of_week_from_date.jpg" alt="Extracting Day of the Week from Date" />
<h2>Obtaining Date from Year, Month and Day</h2>
<p>You data might have the information about Year, Month and Day separately. You need to get the date combining these three values to perform any calculation. You can use the DATE function for getting the date values.</p>
<p>Consider the following data &minus;</p>
<img src="images/obtaining_date_from_year_month_and_day.jpg" alt="Obtaining Date from Year, Month and Day" />
<p>Use the DATE function to obtain DATE values.</p>
<img src="images/date_function.jpg" alt="DATE function" />
<h2>Calculating Years, Months and Days between two Dates</h2>
<p>You might have to calculate the time lapsed from a given date. You might need this information in the form of years, months and days. A simple example would be calculating the current age of a person. It is effectively the difference between the birth date and today. You can use Excel DATEDIF, TODAY and CONCATENATE functions for this purpose.</p>
<img src="images/calculate_time_lapsed.jpg" alt="Calculate Time Lapsed" />
<p>The output is as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Working with Time Values</h1>
<p>The data that you obtain from different sources might contain time values. In this chapter, you will understand how to prepare your data that contains time values for analysis.</p>
<p>You will learn about &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Time Formats
<ul class="list">
<li>Time in Serial Format</li>
<li>Time in Hour-Minute-Second Format</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Obtaining Time from Hour, Minute and Second</li>
<li>Extracting Hour, Minute and Second from Time</li>
<li>Number of hours between Start Time and End Time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time Formats</h2>
<p>Excel supports <b>Time</b> Values in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Serial Format</li>
<li>In various Hour-Minute-Second Formats</li>
</ul>
<p>You can convert &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Time</b> in Serial Format to <b>Time</b> in Hour-Minute-Second Format</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time</b> in Hour-Minute-Second Format to <b>Time</b> in Serial Format</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Time in Serial Format</h3>
<p><b>Time</b> in serial format is a positive number that represents the <b>Time</b> as a fraction of a 24-hour day, the starting point being midnight. For example, 0.29 represents 7 AM and 0.5 represents 12 PM.</p>
<p>You can also combine <b>Date</b> and <b>Time</b> in the same cell. The serial number is the number of days after January 1, 1900, and the time fraction associated with the given time. For example, if you type May 17, 2016 6 AM, it gets converted to 42507.25 when you format the cell as <b>General</b>.</p>
<h3>Time in Hour-Minute-Second Format</h3>
<p>Excel allows you to specify time in Hour-Minute-Second Format with a colon (:) after the hour and another colon before the seconds. Example, 8:50 AM, 8:50 PM or just 8:50 using the 12-Hour Format or as 8:50, 20:50 in 24-Hour format. The time 8:50:55 AM represents 8 hours, 50 minutes and 55 seconds.</p>
<p>You can also specify date and time together. For example, if you type May 17, 2016 7:25 in a cell, it will be displayed as 5/17/2016 7:25 and it represents 5/17/2016 7:25:00 AM.</p>
<p>Excel supports different <b>Time</b> formats based on the <b>Locale</b> (Location) you choose. Hence, you need to first determine the compatibility of your <b>Time</b> formats and data analysis at hand.</p>
<p>For understanding purpose, you can assume United States as the Locale. You find the following <b>Time</b> formats to choose for <b>Date</b> and <b>Time</b> – 17<sup>th</sup> May, 2016 4 PM &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>4:00:00 PM</li>
<li>16:00</li>
<li>4:00 PM</li>
<li>16:00:00</li>
<li>5/17/16 4:00 PM</li>
<li>5/17/16 16:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>Converting Times in Serial Format to Hour-Minute-Second Format</h2>
<p>To convert serial time format to hour-min-sec format follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>Number</b> tab in the <b>Format Cells</b> dialog box</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Time</b> under <b>Category</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <b>Locale</b>. Available <b>Time</b> formats will be displayed as a list under <b>Type</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on a <b>Format</b> under <b>Type</b> to look at the Preview in the box adjacent to <b>Sample</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/converting_times.jpg" alt="Converting Times" />
<p>After choosing the Format, click <b>OK</b></p>
<h2>Converting Times in Hour-Minute-Second Format to Serial Format</h2>
<p>You can convert Time in <b>Hour-Minute-Second</b> format to serial format in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using <b>Format Cells</b> dialog box</p></li>
<li><p>Using Excel <b>TIMEVALUE</b> function</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Format Cells dialog box</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>Number</b> tab in the <b>Format Cells</b> dialog box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>General</b> under <b>Category</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/format_cells_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Format Cells Dialog Box" />
<h3>Using Excel TIMEVALUE Function</h3>
<p>You can use Excel <b>TIMEVALUE</b> function to convert <b>Time</b> to <b>Serial Number</b> format. You need to enclose the <b>Time</b> argument in “”. For example,</p>
<p style="padding-left:20%"><b>TIMEVALUE ("16:55:15")</b> results in 0.70503472</p>
<h2>Obtaining the Current Time</h2>
<p>If you need to perform calculations based on current time, simply use the Excel function NOW (). The result reflects the date and time when it is used.</p>
<p>The following screen shot of Now () function usage has been taken on 17<sup>th</sup> May, 2016 at 12:22 PM.</p>
<img src="images/obtaining_current_time.jpg" alt="Obtaining Current Time" />
<h2>Obtaining Time from Hour, Minute and Second</h2>
<p>Your data might have the information about hours, minutes and seconds separately. Suppose, you need to get the Time combining these 3 values to perform any calculation. You can use Excel Function Time for getting the Time values.</p>
<img src="images/obtaining_time.jpg" alt="Obtaining Time" />
<h2>Extracting Hour, Minute and Second from Time</h2>
<p>You can extract hour, minute and second from a given time using the Excel functions HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND.</p>
<img src="images/extract_time.jpg" alt="Extract Time" />
<h2>Number of hours between Start Time and End Time</h2>
<p>When you perform computations on Time values, the result displayed depends on the format used in the cell. For example, you can compute the number of hours between 9:30 AM and 6 PM as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/number_of_hours.jpg" alt="Number of Hours" />
<ul class="list">
<li>C4 is formatted as Time</li>
<li>C5 and C6 are formatted as Number.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the time difference as days. To convert to hours you need to multiply by 24.</p>
<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Conditional Formatting</h1>
<p>In Microsoft Excel, you can use <b>Conditional Formatting</b> for data visualization. You have to specify formatting for a cell range based on the contents of the cell range. The cells that meet the specified conditions would be formatted as you have defined.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In a range containing the sales figures of the past quarter for a set of salespersons, you can highlight those cells representing who have met the defined target, say, &dollar;2500.</p>
<p>You can set the condition as total sales of the person &gt;= <b>&dollar;2500</b> and specify a color code green. Excel checks each cell in the range to determine whether the condition you specified, i.e., total sales of the person &gt;= &dollar;2500 is satisfied.</p>
<p>Excel applies the format you chose, i.e. the green color to all the cells that satisfy the condition. If the content of a cell does not satisfy the condition, the formatting of the cell remains unchanged. The result is as expected, only for the salespersons who have met the target, the cells are highlighted in green – a quick visualization of the analysis results.</p>
<p>You can specify any number of conditions for formatting by specifying <b>Rules</b>. You can pick up the rules that match your conditions from</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Highlight cells rules</li>
<li>Top / Bottom rules</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define your own rules. You can &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Add a rule</li>
<li>Clear an existing rule</li>
<li>Manage the defined rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, you have several formatting options in Excel to choose the ones that are appropriate for your Data Visualization &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data Bars</li>
<li>Color Scales</li>
<li>Icon Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Conditional formatting has been promoted over the versions Excel 2007, Excel 2010, Excel 2013. The examples you find in this chapter are from Excel 2013.</p>
<p>In the following sections, you will understand the conditional formatting rules, formatting options and how to work with rules.</p>
<h2>Highlight Cells Rules</h2>
<p>You can use <b>Highlight Cells</b> rule to assign a format to cells whose contents meet any of the following criteria &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Bars</h2>
<p>You can use colored <b>Data Bars</b> to see the value in a cell relative to the values in the other cells. The length of the data bar represents the value in the cell. A longer bar represents a higher value, and a shorter bar represents a lower value. You have six solid colors to choose from for the data bars – blue, green, red, yellow, light blue and purple.</p>
<p>Data bars are helpful in visualizing the higher, lower and intermediate values when you have large amounts of data. Example - Day temperatures across regions in a particular month. You can use gradient fill color bars to visualize the value in a cell relative to the values in other cells. You have six <b>Gradient Colors</b> to choose from for the Data Bars – Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Light Blue and Purple.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the range to be formatted conditionally.</p></li>

<img src="images/stretches_to_left_and_right.jpg" alt="Stretches to Left and Right" />
<h2>Color Scales</h2>
<p>You can use <b>Color Scales</b> to see the value in a cell relative to the values in the other cells in a given range. As in the case of <b>Highlight Cells Rules</b>, a <b>Color Scale</b> uses cell shading to display the differences in cell values. A color gradient will be applied to a range of cells. The color indicates where each cell value falls within that range.</p>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Sorting</h1>
<p>Sorting data is an integral part of Data Analysis. You can arrange a list of names in alphabetical order, compile a list of sales figures from highest to lowest, or order rows by colors or icons. Sorting data helps you quickly visualize and understand your data better, organize and find the data that you want, and ultimately make more effective decisions.</p>
<p>You can sort by columns or by rows. Most of the sorts that you use will be column sorts.</p>
<p>You can sort data in one or more columns by</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>text (A to Z or Z to A)</li>
<li>numbers (smallest to largest or largest to smallest)</li>
<li>dates and times (oldest to newest and newest to oldest)</li>
<li>a custom list (E.g. Large, Medium, and Small)</li>
<li>format, including cell color, font color, or icon set</li>
</ul>
<p>Sort criteria for a table are saved with the workbook such that you can reapply the sort to that table every time you open the workbook. Sort criteria are not saved for a range of cells. For multicolumn sorts or for sorts that take a long time to create, you can convert the range to a table. Then, you can reapply the sort when you open a workbook.</p>
<p>In all the examples in the following sections, you will find tables only, since it is more meaningful to sort a table.</p>
<h2>Sort by Text</h2>
<p>You can sort a table using a column containing text.</p>
<p>The following table has information about employees in an organization (You are able to see only the first few rows in the data).</p>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Filtering</h1>
<p>Filtering allows you to extract data that meets the defined criteria from a given Range or table. This is a quick way to display only the information that is needed by you.</p>
<p>You can Filter data in a Range, table or PivotTable.</p>
<p>You can filter data by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Selected values</li>
<li>Text filters if the column you selected contains text</li>
<li>Date filters if the column you selected contains dates</li>

<li>Number filters if the column you selected contains numbers</li>
<li>Font color if the column you selected contains font with color</li>
<li>Cell icon if the column you selected contains cell icons</li>
<li>Advanced filter</li>
<li>Using slicers</li>
</ul>
<p>In a table, the column headers are automatically tagged to filters, known as <b>AutoFilters</b>. <b>AutoFilter</b> is represented by the arrow <img class="inline" src="images/arrow.jpg" alt="Arrow" /> next to column header. Each <b>AutoFilter</b> has filter options based on the type of data you have in that column. For example, if the column contains numbers, when you click on the arrow <img class="inline" src="images/arrow.jpg" alt="Arrow" /> next to the column header, <b>Number Filter Options</b> appear.</p>
<p>When you click a Filter option or when you click on <b>Custom Filter</b> that appears at the end of the Filter options, <b>Custom AutoFilter</b> dialog box appears, wherein you can customize your filtering options.</p>
<p>In case of a Range, you can provide the column headers in the first row of the range and click on filter in the <b>Editing</b> group on <b>Home</b> tab. This will make the <b>AutoFilter</b> on for the Range. You can remove the filters that you have in your data. You can also reapply the filters when data changes occur.</p>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Subtotals with Ranges</h1>
<p>If you have a list of data that you want to group and summarize, you can use Excel <b>Subtotal</b> and <b>Outline</b> to display summary rows or columns. You can use <b>PivotTable</b> also for this purpose, but using <b>Subtotal</b> and <b>Outline</b> is the quickest way to analyze a range of data. Note that <b>Subtotal</b> and <b>Outline</b> can be used only on a range and not on a table.</p> 
<p>You can create an <b>Outline</b> of up to eight levels, one for each group. Outer Levels are represented by Lower Numbers and Inner Levels by Higher Numbers. Each inner level displays detailed data for the preceding outer level.</p>
<p>To understand how to use <b>Subtotal</b> and <b>Outline</b>, consider the following example wherein the sales data of various items is given salesperson wise and location wise. In total, there are 1891 rows of data.</p>
<img src="images/rows_data.jpg" alt="Rows Data" />
<h2>Subtotals</h2>
<p>You can obtain the sum of sales location wise using <b>Subtotal</b>.</p>
<p>First, sort the data location wise.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click anywhere on the data range.</p></li> 
<li><p>Click the <b>DATA</b> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Sort</b>.</p></li>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Quick Analysis</h1>
<p>In Microsoft Excel 2013, the <b>Quick Analysis</b> tool makes it possible to analyze your data quickly and easily using different Excel tools.</p> 
<p>You can use <b>Quick Analysis</b> with a range or a table of data. To access <b>Quick Access</b> tool, select the cells that contain the data you want to analyze. The <b>Quick Analysis</b> tool button <img class="inline" src="images/quick_analysis_tool_button.jpg" alt="Quick Analysis Tool Button" /> appears at the bottom right of your selected data.</p>
<img src="images/quick_analysis.jpg" alt="Quick Analysis" />
<p>Click the <b>Quick Analysis</b> <img class="inline" src="images/quick_analysis_tool_button.jpg" alt="Quick Analysis Tool Button" /> button. The Quick Analysis toolbar appears with the options <b>FORMATTING, CHARTS, TOTALS, TABLES, SPARKLINES</b>.</p>
<img src="images/quick_analysis_toolbar.jpg" alt="Quick Analysis Toolbar" />  
<p><b>Quick Analysis</b> tool is handy and quick to use as you can also have a preview of applying different options, before selecting the one you want.</p>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p><b>Conditional Formatting</b> allows you to highlight parts of your data by adding Data Bars, Colors, etc. This lets you quickly visualize the values in your data.</p> 
<p>You have learnt about formatting rules in the <a href="excel_data_analysis_conditional_formatting.html">Conditional Formatting</a> chapter in this tutorial. The difference is that you can have a quick preview and select the option you want. However, if you want to utilize all the features of <b>Conditional Formatting</b>, you rather go through the main menu on the Ribbon. The same thing holds for all the options in the <b>Quick Analysis</b> tool.</p> 
<p>Click <b>Formatting</b> on the <b>Quick Analysis</b> toolbar. The <b>Conditional Formatting</b> options appear in the toolbar. Move your mouse on the options. You will see the previews. You can then select the option you want by clicking it.</p>
<img src="images/formatting.jpg" alt="Formatting" />
<h3>Charts</h3>
<p><b>Charts</b> are used to depict the data pictorially. There are several types of <b>Charts</b> to suit different types of data.</p> 
<p>If you click <b>CHARTS</b> on the <b>Quick Analysis</b> toolbar, the recommended charts for the data you have selected will be displayed. You can always choose <b>More Charts</b> option if you want to go to the main <b>Charts</b> on the Ribbon.</p> 
<p>Hover your mouse on the options. You will see the previews. You can then select the option you want by clicking it.</p>
<img src="images/charts.jpg" alt="Charts" />
<h3>Totals</h3>
<p><b>Totals</b> can be used to calculate the numbers in columns and rows. You will have functions such as Sum, Average, Count, etc.</p> 
<p>We will go into the details on how to use <b>Quick Analysis</b> tool with <b>TOTALS</b> later in this chapter. You can use the other options in <b>Quick Analysis</b> with the same ease, as you observe.</p>
<h3>Tables</h3>
<p><b>Tables</b> help you to filter, sort and summarize your data, as you have already learnt in the <b>Tables</b> chapter. In the <b>Quick Analysis</b> tool, both the <b>Table</b> and <b>PivotTable</b> options are available under <b>TABLES</b>. However, you can have a preview for the table, but in the case of <b>PivotTable</b> no preview is available as by clicking you will get an empty <b>PivotTable</b> which you need to populate with the data.</p>
<img src="images/tables.jpg" alt="Tables" />
<h3>Sparklines</h3>
<p><b>Sparklines</b> are tiny charts that you can show alongside your data in single cells. They provide a quick way to see trends.</p>       
<img src="images/sparklines.jpg" alt="Sparklines" />
<h2>Quick Analysis with TOTALS</h2>
<p>Click on <b>TOTALS</b> in the <b>Quick Analysis</b> Toolbar.</p> 
<p>In <b>Quick Analysis</b> with <b>TOTALS</b>, you can analyze</p>
<p style="padding-left:5%">Row-wise <img class="inline" src="images/row_wise.jpg" alt="Row-wise" /></p>   
<p style="padding-left:5%">Column-wise <img class="inline" src="images/column_wise.jpg" alt="Column-wise" /></p>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Lookup Functions</h1>
<p>You can use Excel functions to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Find values in a range of data - VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP</li>
<li>Obtain a value or the reference to a value from within a table or range - INDEX</li>
<li>Obtain the relative position of a specified item in a range of cells -  MATCH</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also combine these functions to get the required results based on the inputs you have.</p> 
<h2>Using VLOOKUP Function</h2>
<p>The syntax of the VLOOKUP function is</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
</pre>
<p>Where</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>lookup_value</b> &minus; is the value you want to look up. Lookup_value can be a value or a reference to a cell. Lookup_value must be in the first column of the range of cells you specify in table_array</p></li>
<li><p><b>table_array</b> &minus; is the range of cells in which the VLOOKUP will search for the lookup_value and the return value. table_array must contain</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>the lookup_value in the first column, and</p></li>
<li><p>the return value you want to find</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The first column containing the lookup_value can either be sorted in ascending order or not. However, the result will be based on the order of this column.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>col_index_num</b> &minus; is the column number in the table_array that contains the return value. The numbers start with 1 for the left-most column of table-array</p></li>
<li><p><b>range_lookup</b> &minus; is an optional logical value that specifies whether you want VLOOKUP to find an exact match or an approximate match. range_lookup can be</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>omitted, in which case it is assumed to be TRUE and VLOOKUP tries to find an approximate match</p></li>  
<li><p>TRUE, in which case VLOOKUP tries to find an approximate match. In other words, if an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned</p></li>
<li><p>FALSE, in which case VLOOKUP tries to find an exact match</p></li>
<li><p>1, in which case it is assumed to be TRUE and VLOOKUP tries to find an approximate match</p></li> 
<li><p>0, in which case it is assumed to be FALSE and VLOOKUP tries to find an exact match</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul> 
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; If range_lookup is omitted or TRUE or 1, VLOOKUP works correctly only when the first column in table_array is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, it may result in incorrect values. In such a case, use FALSE for range_lookup.</p>
<h2>Using VLOOKUP Function with range_lookup TRUE</h2>
<p>Consider a list of student marks. You can obtain the corresponding grades with VLOOKUP from an array containing the marks intervals and pass category.</p> 
<p>table_array &minus;</p>
<img src="images/vlookup_function_with_true.jpg" alt="Vlookup Function with True" />
<p>Note that the first column marks based on which the grades are obtained is sorted in ascending order. Hence, using TRUE for range_lookup argument you can get approximate match that is what is required.</p>
<p>Name this array as <b>Grades</b>.</p>
<p>It is a good practice to name arrays in this way so that you need not remember the cell ranges. Now, you are ready to look up the grade for the list of marks you have as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/grades.jpg" alt="Grades" />    
<p>As you can observe,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>col_index_num</b> &minus;  indicates the column of the return value in table_array is 2</p></li>
<li><p>the <b>range_lookup</b> is TRUE</p>
<ul class="list">  
<li><p>The first column containing the lookup value in the table_array grades is in ascending order. Hence, the results will be correct.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get the return value for approximate matches also. i.e. VLOOKUP computes as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul></li> 
</ul>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Marks</th> 
<th style="text-align:center;">Pass Category</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt; 35</td>
<td>Fail</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;= 35 and &lt; 50</td>
<td>Third Class</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;= 50 and &lt; 60</td>
<td>Second Class</td>

<tr>
<td>&gt;=60 and &lt; 75</td>
<td>First Class</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;= 75</td>
<td>First Class with Distinction</td>
</tr>
</table>          
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/vlookup_function_with_true_result.jpg" alt="Vlookup Function with True Result" />
<h2>Using VLOOKUP Function with range_lookup FALSE</h2> 
<p>Consider a list of products containing the Product ID and price for each of the products. The product ID and price will be added to the end of the list whenever a new product is launched. This would mean that the product IDs need not be in ascending order. The product list might be as shown below &minus;</p>
<p>table_array &minus;</p>
<img src="images/table_array.jpg" alt="Table Array" />
<p>Name this array as ProductInfo.</p>
<p>You can obtain the price of a product given the product ID with the VLOOKUP function as the product ID is in the first column. The price is in column 3 and hence col_index_ num should be 3.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Use VLOOKUP Function with range_lookup as TRUE</li> 
<li>Use VLOOKUP Function with range_lookup as FALSE</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/vlookup_function_with_false.jpg" alt="Vlookup Function with False" />
<p>The correct answer is from the ProductInfo array is 171.65. You can check the results.</p>
<img src="images/vlookup_function_with_false_result.jpg" alt="Vlookup Function with False Result" />
<p>You observe that you got &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The correct result when range_lookup is FALSE, and</li>
<li>A wrong result when range_lookup is TRUE.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because, the first column in the ProductInfo array is not sorted in ascending order. Hence, remember to use FALSE whenever the data is not sorted.</p>
<h2>Using HLOOKUP Function</h2>
<p>You can use <b>HLOOKUP</b> function if the data is in rows rather than columns.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us take the example of product information. Suppose the array looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/hlookup_function.jpg" alt="Hlookup Function" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Name this Array ProductRange. You can find the price of a product given the product ID with HLOOKUP function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Syntax of HLOOKUP function is</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
HLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])
</pre>
<p>Where</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>lookup_value</b> &minus; is the value to be found in the first row of the table</p></li>  
<li><p><b>table_array</b> &minus; is a table of information in which data is looked up</p></li> 
<li><p><b>row_index_num</b> &minus; is the row number in table_array from which the matching value will be returned</p></li>
<li><p><b>range_lookup</b> &minus; is a logical value that specifies whether you want HLOOKUP to find an exact match or an approximate match</p></li> 
<li><p><b>range_lookup</b> can be</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>omitted, in which case it is assumed to be TRUE and HLOOKUP tries to find an approximate match</p></li>
<li><p>TRUE, in which case HLOOKUP tries to find an approximate match. In other words, if an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned</p></li>  
<li><p>FALSE, in which case HLOOKUP tries to find an exact match</p></li> 
<li><p>1, in which case it is assumed to be TRUE and HLOOKUP tries to find an approximate match</p></li>  
<li><p>0, in which case it is assumed to be FALSE and HLOOKUP tries to find an exact match</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; If range_lookup is Omitted or TRUE or 1, HLOOKUP works correctly only when the first column in table_array is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, it may result in incorrect values. In such a case, use FALSE for range_lookup.</p> 
<h2>Using HLOOKUP Function with range_lookup FALSE</h2>
<p>You can obtain the price of a product given the product ID with the HLOOKUP function as the product ID is in the first row. The price is in row 3 and hence row_index_ num should be 3.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Use HLOOKUP Function with range_lookup as TRUE.</li> 
<li>Use HLOOKUP Function with range_lookup as FALSE.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/hlookup_function_with_false.jpg" alt="Hlookup Function with False" />
<p>The correct answer from the ProductRange array is 171.65. You can check the results.</p>
<img src="images/hlookup_function_with_false_result.jpg" alt="Hlookup Function with False Result" />
<p>You observe that as in the case of VLOOKUP, you got</p>
<ul class="list">  
<li><p>The correct result when range_lookup is FALSE, and</p></li>
<li><p>A wrong result when range_lookup is TRUE.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is because the first row in the ProductRange array is not sorted in ascending order. Hence, remember to use FALSE whenever the data is not sorted.</p>
<h2>Using HLOOKUP Function with range_lookup TRUE</h2>
<p>Consider the example of student marks used in VLOOKUP. Suppose you have the data in rows instead of columns as shown in the table given below &minus;</p>
<p>table_array &minus;</p>
<img src="images/hlookup_function_with_true.jpg" alt="Hlookup Function with True" />
<p>Name this array as GradesRange.</p>
<p>Note that the first row marks based on which the grades are obtained is sorted in ascending order. Hence, using HLOOKUP with TRUE for range_lookup argument, you can get the Grades with approximate match and that is what is required.</p>
<img src="images/gradesrange.jpg" alt="GradesRange" />
<p>As you can observe,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>row_index_num</b> &minus; indicates the column of the return value in table_array is 2</p></li>
<li><p>the <b>range_lookup</b> is TRUE</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The first column containing the lookup value in the table_array Grades is in ascending order. Hence, the results will be correct.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get the return value for approximate matches also. i.e. HLOOKUP computes as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Marks</th>
<td style="width:12%;vertical-align:middle;">&lt; 35</td>

<td>First Class with Distinction</td>
</tr>
</table> 
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/student_grades.jpg" alt="Student Grades" />
<h2>Using INDEX Function</h2>
<p>When you have an array of data, you can retrieve a value in the array by specifying the row number and column number of that value in the array.</p>
<p>Consider the following sales data, wherein you find the sales in each of the North, South, East and West regions by the salespersons who are listed.</p>
<img src="images/salesdata.jpg" alt="SalesData" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Name the array as SalesData.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Using INDEX Function, you can find &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The Sales of any of the Salespersons in a certain Region.</li>
<li>Total Sales in a Region by all the Salespersons.</li>
<li>Total Sales by a Salesperson in all the Regions.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/using_index_function.jpg" alt="Using Index Function" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/using_index_function_result.jpg" alt="Using Index Function Result" />
<p>Suppose you do not know the row numbers for the salespersons and column numbers for the regions. Then, you need to find the row number and column number first before you retrieve the value with the index function.</p>
<p>You can do it with the MATCH function as explained in the next section.</p>
<h2>Using MATCH Function</h2>
<p>If you need the position of an item in a range, you can use the MATCH function. You can combine MATCH and INDEX functions as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/using_match_function.jpg" alt="Using Match Function" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - PivotTables</h1>
<p>Data analysis on a large set of data is quite often necessary and important. It involves summarizing the data, obtaining the needed values and presenting the results.</p>
<p>Excel provides PivotTable to enable you summarize thousands of data values easily and quickly so as to obtain the required results.</p>
<p>Consider the following table of sales data. From this data, you might have to summarize total sales region wise, month wise, or salesperson wise. The easy way to handle these tasks is to create a PivotTable that you can dynamically modify to summarize the results the way you want.</p>
<img src="images/sales_data_table.jpg" alt="Sales Data Table" />
<h2>Creating PivotTable</h2>
<p>To create PivotTables, ensure the first row has headers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the table.</li>
<li>Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click PivotTable in the Tables group. The PivotTable dialog box appears.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/creating_pivottable.jpg" alt="Creating PivotTable" />
<p>As you can see in the dialog box, you can use either a Table or Range from the current workbook or use an external data source.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>In the Table / Range Box, type the table name.</li>
<li>Click New Worksheet to tell Excel where to keep the PivotTable.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/table_range_box.jpg" alt="Table Range Box" />
<p>A Blank PivotTable and a PivotTable fields list appear.</p>
<img src="images/blank_pivottable_fields.jpg" alt="Blank PivotTable Fields" />
<h2>Recommended PivotTables</h2>
<p>In case you are new to PivotTables or you do not know which fields to select from the data, you can use the <b>Recommended PivotTables</b> that Excel provides.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the data table.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the INSERT tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Recommended PivotTables in the Tables group. The Recommended PivotTables dialog box appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/recommended_pivottables.jpg" alt="Recommended PivotTables" />
<p>In the recommended PivotTables dialog box, the possible customized PivotTables that suit your data are displayed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click each of the PivotTable options to see the preview on the right side.</li>
<li>Click the PivotTable Sum of Order Amount by Salesperson and month.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/recommended_pivottables_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Recommended PivotTables Dialog Box" />
<p>Click OK. The selected PivotTable appears on a new worksheet. You can observe the PivotTable fields that was selected in the PivotTable fields list.</p>
<img src="images/pivottable_fields_list.jpg" alt="PivotTable Fields List" />
<h2>PivotTable Fields</h2>
<p>The headers in your data table will appear as the fields in the PivotTable.</p>
<img src="images/header_pivottable_fields.jpg" alt="Header PivotTable Fields" />
<p>You can select / deselect them to instantly change your PivotTable to display only the information you want and in a way that you want. For example, if you want to display the account information instead of order amount information, deselect Order Amount and select Account.</p>
<img src="images/select_deselect_pivottable_fields.jpg" alt="Select / Deselect PivotTable Fields" />
<h2>PivotTable Areas</h2>
<p>You can even change the Layout of your PivotTable instantly. You can use the PivotTable Areas to accomplish this.</p>
<img src="images/pivottable_areas.jpg" alt="PivotTable Areas" />
<p>In PivotTable areas, you can choose &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>What fields to display as rows</li>
<li>What fields to display as columns</li>
<li>How to summarize your data</li>
<li>Filters for any of the fields</li>
<li>When to update your PivotTable Layout
<ul class="list">
<li>You can update it instantly as you drag the fields across areas, or</li>
<li>You can defer the update and get it updated only when you click on UPDATE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An instant update helps you to play around with the different Layouts and pick the one that suits your report requirement.</p>
<p>You can just drag the fields across these areas and observe the PivotTable layout as you do it.</p>
<img src="images/observe_pivottable_layout.jpg" alt="Observe PivotTable Layout" />
<h2>Nesting in the PivotTable</h2>
<p>If you have more than one field in any of the areas, then nesting happens in the order you place the fields in that area. You can change the order by dragging the fields and observe how nesting changes. In the above layout options, you can observe that</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Months are in columns.</li>
<li>Region and salesperson in rows in that order. i.e. salesperson values are nested under region values.</li>
<li>Summarizing is by Sum of Order Amount.</li>
<li>No filters are chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting PivotTable is as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/pivottable_result.jpg" alt="PivotTable Result" />
<p>In the PivotTable Areas, in rows, click region and drag it below salesperson such that it looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/salesperson.jpg" alt="Salesperson" />
<p>The nesting order changes and the resulting PivotTable is as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/nesting_order_changes.jpg" alt="Nesting Order Changes" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can clearly observe that the layout with the nesting order – Region and then Salesperson yields a better and compact report than the one with the nesting order – Salesperson and then Region. In case Salesperson represents more than one area and you need to summarize the sales by Salesperson, then the second layout would have been a better option.</p>
<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>You can assign a Filter to one of the fields so that you can dynamically change the PivotTable based on the values of that field.</p>
<p>Drag Region from Rows to Filters in the PivotTable Areas.</p>
<img src="images/filters.jpg" alt="Filters" />
<p>The filter with the label as Region appears above the PivotTable (in case you do not have empty rows above your PivotTable, PivotTable gets pushed down to make space for the Filter.</p>
<img src="images/filter_with_label.jpg" alt="Filters with Label" />
<p>You can see that &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Salesperson values appear in rows.</li>
<li>Month values appear in columns.</li>
<li>Region Filter appears on the top with default selected as ALL.</li>
<li>Summarizing value is Sum of Order Amount
<ul class="list">
<li>Sum of Order Amount Salesperson-wise appears in the column Grand Total</li>
<li>Sum of Order Amount Month-wise appears in the row Grand Total</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the arrow in the box to the right of the filter region. A drop-down list with the values of the field region appears.</p>
<img src="images/field_values.jpg" alt="Field Values" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Check the option <b>Select Multiple Items</b>. Check boxes appear for all the values.</li>
<li>Select South and West and deselect the other values and click OK.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_multiple_items.jpg" alt="Select Multiple Items" />
<p>The data pertaining to South and West Regions only will be summarized as shown in the screen shot given below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/data_pertaining.jpg" alt="Data Pertaining" />
<p>You can see that next to the Filter Region, <b>Multiple Items</b> is displayed, indicating that you have selected more than one item. However, how many items and / or which items are selected is not known from the report that is displayed. In such a case, using Slicers is a better option for filtering.</p>
<h2>Slicers</h2>
<p>You can use Slicers to have a better clarity on which items the data was filtered.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click ANALYZE under PIVOTTABLE TOOLS on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Insert Slicer in the Filter group. The Insert Slicers box appears. It contains all the fields from your data.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the fields Region and month. Click OK.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/slicers.jpg" alt="Slicers" />
<p>Slicers for each of the selected fields appear with all the values selected by default. Slicer Tools appear on the Ribbon to work on the Slicer settings, look and feel.</p>
<img src="images/selected_fields.jpg" alt="Selected Fields" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Select South and West in the Slicer for Region.</li>
<li>Select February and March in the Slicer for month.</li>
<li>Keep Ctrl key pressed while selecting multiple values in a Slicer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selected items in the Slicers are highlighted. PivotTable with summarized values for the selected items will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/selected_items_highlighted.jpg" alt="Selected Items Highlighted" />
<h2>Summarizing Values by other Calculations</h2>
<p>In the examples so far, you have seen summarizing values by Sum. However, you can use other calculations also if necessary.</p>
<p>In the PivotTable Fields List</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the Field Account.</li>
<li>Unselect the Field Order Amount.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/summarizing_values.jpg" alt="Summarizing Values" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag the field Account to Summarizing Values area. By default, Sum of Account will be displayed.</li>
<li>Click the arrow on the right side of the box.</li>
<li>In the drop-down that appears, click Value Field Settings.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/value_field_settings.jpg" alt="Value Field Settings" />
<p>The Value Field Settings box appears. Several types of calculations appear as a list under Summarize value field by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select Count in the list.</li>
<li>The Custom Name automatically changes to Count of Account. Click OK.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_count.jpg" alt="Select Count" />

<h2>Expanding and Collapsing Field</h2>
<p>You can either expand or collapse all items of a selected field in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>By selecting the symbol <img class="inline" src="images/plus.jpg" alt="Plus" /> or <img class="inline" src="images/minus.jpg" alt="Minus" /> to the left of the selected field.</li>
<li>By clicking the Expand Field or Collapse Field on the ANALYZE Ribbon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>By selecting the Expand symbol <img class="inline" src="images/plus.jpg" alt="Plus" /> or Collapse symbol <img class="inline" src="images/minus.jpg" alt="Minus" /> to the left of the selected field</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the cell containing East in the PivotTable.</li>
<li>Click on the Collapse symbol <img class="inline" src="images/minus.jpg" alt="Minus" /> to the left of East.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/expanding_and_collapsing_field.jpg" alt="Expanding and Collapsing Field" />
<p>All the items under East will be collapsed. The Collapse symbol <img class="inline" src="images/minus.jpg" alt="Minus" /> to the left of East changes to the Expand symbol <img class="inline" src="images/plus.jpg" alt="Plus" />.</p>
<img src="images/collapse_and_expand.jpg" alt="Collapse and Expand" />
<p>You can observe that only the items below East are collapsed. The rest of the PivotTable items are as they are.</p>
<p>Click the Expand symbol <img class="inline" src="images/plus.jpg" alt="Plus" /> to the left of East. All the items below East will be displayed.</p>
<h3>Using ANALYZE on the Ribbon</h3>
<p>You can collapse or expand all items in the PivotTable at once with the Expand Field and Collapse Field commands on the Ribbon.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the cell containing East in the PivotTable.</li>
<li>Click the ANALYZE tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Collapse Field in the Active Field group.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/using_analyze.jpg" alt="Using Analyze" />

<p>Click Expand Field in the Active Field group.</p>
<img src="images/expand_field.jpg" alt="Expand Field" />
<p>All the items will be displayed.</p>
<h2>Report Presentation Styles</h2>
<p>You can choose the presentation style for your PivotTable as you would be including it as a report. Select a style that fits into the rest of your presentation or report. However, do not get over bored with the styles because a report that gives an impact in showing the results is always better than a colorful one, which does not highlight the important data points.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click East in the PivotTable.</li>
<li>Click ANALYZE.</li>
<li>Click Field Settings in Active Field group. The Field Settings dialog box appears.</li>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Data Visualization</h1>
<p>You can display your data analysis reports in a number of ways in Excel. However, if your data analysis results can be visualized as charts that highlight the notable points in the data, your audience can quickly grasp what you want to project in the data. It also leaves a good impact on your presentation style.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will get to know how to use Excel charts and Excel formatting features on charts that enable you to present your data analysis results with emphasis.</p>
<h3>Visualizing Data with Charts</h3>
<p>In Excel, charts are used to make a graphical representation of any set of data. A chart is a visual representation of the data, in which the data is represented by symbols such as bars in a Bar Chart or lines in a Line Chart. Excel provides you with many chart types and you can choose one that suits your data or you can use the Excel Recommended Charts option to view charts customized to your data and select one of those.</p>
<p>Refer to the Tutorial Excel Charts for more information on chart types.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will understand the different techniques that you can use with the Excel charts to highlight your data analysis results more effectively.</p>
<h2>Creating Combination Charts</h2>
<p>Suppose you have the target and actual profits for the fiscal year 2015-2016 that you obtained from different regions.</p>
<img src="images/creating_combination_charts.jpg" alt="Creating Combination Charts" />
<p>We will create a Clustered Column Chart for these results.</p>
<img src="images/clustered_column_chart.jpg" alt="Clustered Column Chart" />
<p>As you observe, it is difficult to visualize the comparison quickly between the targets and actual in this chart. It does not give a true impact on your results.</p>
<p>A better way of distinguishing two types of data to compare the values is by using Combination Charts. In Excel 2013 and versions above, you can use Combo charts for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Use Vertical Columns for the target values and a Line with Markers for the actual values.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the DESIGN tab under the CHART TOOLS tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Change Chart Type in the Type group. The Change Chart Type dialog box appears.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/use_vertical_columns.jpg" alt="Use Vertical Columns" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click Combo.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the Chart Type for the series Actual to Line with Markers. The preview appears under Custom Combination.</p></li>
<li><p>Click OK.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/change_chart_type.jpg" alt="Change Chart Type" />
<p>Your Customized Combination Chart will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/customized_combination_chart.jpg" alt="Customized Combination Chart" />
<p>As you observe in the chart, the Target values are in Columns and the Actual values are marked along the line. The data visualization has become better as it also shows you the trend of your results.</p>
<p>However, this type of representation does not work well when the data ranges of your two data values vary significantly.</p>
<h2>Creating a Combo Chart with Secondary Axis</h2>
<p>Suppose you have the data on the number of units of your product that was shipped and the actual profits for the fiscal year 2015-2016 that you obtained from different regions.</p>
<img src="images/combo_chart.jpg" alt="Combo Chart" />
<p>If you use the same combination chart as before, you will get the following &minus;</p>
<img src="images/combination_chart.jpg" alt="Combination Chart" />
<p>In the chart, the data of <b>No. of Units</b> is not visible as the data ranges are varying significantly.</p>
<p>In such cases, you can create a combination chart with secondary axis, so that the primary axis displays one range and the secondary axis displays the other.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the INSERT tab.</li>
<li>Click Combo in Charts group.</li>
<li>Click Create Custom Combo Chart from the drop-down list.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/custom_combo_chart.jpg" alt="Custom Combo Chart" />
<p>The Insert Chart dialog box appears with Combo highlighted.</p>
<p>For Chart Type, choose &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li></p>Line with Markers for the Series No. of Units</p></li>
<li></p>Clustered Column for the Series Actual Profits</p></li>
<li></p>Check the Box Secondary Axis to the right of the Series No. of Units and click OK.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A preview of your chart appears under Custom Combination.</p>
<img src="images/custom_combination.jpg" alt="Custom Combination" />
<p>Your Combo chart appears with Secondary Axis.</p>
<img src="images/combo_chart_with_secondary_axis.jpg" alt="Combo Chart with Secondary Axis" />
<p>You can observe the values for Actual Profits on the primary axis and the values for No. of Units on the secondary axis.</p>
<p>A significant observation in the above chart is for Quarter 3 where No. of Units sold is more, but the Actual Profits made are less. This could probably be assigned to the promotion costs that were incurred to increase sales. The situation is improved in Quarter 4, with a slight decrease in sales and a significant rise in the Actual Profits made.</p>
<h2>Discriminating Series and Category Axis</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to project the Actual Profits made in Years 2013-2016.</p>
<img src="images/discriminating_series_and_category_axis.jpg" alt="Discriminating Series and Category Axis" />
<p>Create a clustered column for this data.</p>
<img src="images/clustered_column.jpg" alt="Clustered Column" />
<p>As you observe, the data visualization is not effective as the years are not displayed. You can overcome this by changing year to category.</p>
<p>Remove the header year in the data range.</p>
<img src="images/remove_header_year.jpg" alt="Remove Header Year" />
<p>Now, year is considered as a category and not a series. Your chart looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/year_as_category.jpg" alt="Year as Category" />
<h2>Chart Elements and Chart Styles</h2>
<p>Chart Elements give more descriptions to your charts, thus helping visualizing your data more meaningfully.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Chart</li>
</ul>
<p>Three buttons appear next to the upper-right corner of the chart &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><img class="inline" src="images/chart_elements.jpg" alt="Chart Elements" /> Chart Elements</li>
<li><img class="inline" src="images/chart_styles.jpg" alt="Chart Styles " /> Chart Styles </li>
<li><img class="inline" src="images/chart_filters.jpg" alt="Chart Filters" /> Chart Filters</li>
</ul>
<p>For a detailed explanation of these, refer to Excel Charts tutorial.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click Chart Elements.</li>
<li>Click Data Labels.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/click_data_labels.jpg" alt="Click Data Labels" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Click Chart Styles</li>
<li>Select a Style and Color that suits your data.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_style_and_color.jpg" alt="Select Style and Color" />
<p>You can use Trendline to graphically display trends in data. You can extend a Trendline in a chart beyond the actual data to predict future values.</p>
<img src="images/trendline.jpg" alt="Trendline" />
<h2>Data Labels</h2>
<p>Excel 2013 and later versions provide you with various options to display Data Labels. You can choose one Data Label, format it as you like, and then use Clone Current Label to copy the formatting to the rest of the Data Labels in the chart.</p>
<p>The Data Labels in a chart can have effects, varying shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>It is also possible to display the content of a cell as part of the Data Label with Insert Data Label Field.</p>
<img src="images/data_label.jpg" alt="Data Label" />
<h2>Quick Layout</h2>
<p>You can use Quick Layout to change the overall layout of the chart quickly by choosing one of the predefined layout options.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the chart.</li>
<li>Click the DESIGN tab under CHART TOOLS.</li>
<li>Click Quick Layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different possible layouts will be displayed. As you move on the layout options, the chart layout changes to that particular option.</p>
<img src="images/quick_layout.jpg" alt="Quick Layout" />
<p>Select the layout you like. The chart will be displayed with the chosen layout.</p>
<h2>Using Pictures in Column Charts</h2>
<p>You can create more emphasis on your data presentation by using a picture in place of columns.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on a Column on the Column Chart.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Format Data Series, click on Fill.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Picture.</p></li>
<li><p>Under Insert picture from, provide the filename or optionally clipboard if you had copied an image earlier.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/using_pictures.jpg" alt="Using Pictures" />
<p>The picture you have chosen will appear in place of columns in the chart.</p>
<img src="images/place_pictures.jpg" alt="Place Pictures" />
<h2>Band Chart</h2>
<p>You might have to present customer survey results of a product from different regions. Band Chart is suitable for this purpose. A Band Chart is a Line Chart with an added shaded area to display the upper and lower boundaries of groups of data.</p>
<p>Suppose your customer survey results from the east and west regions, month wise are &minus;</p>
<img src="images/band_chart.jpg" alt="Band Chart" />
<p>Here, in the data &lt; 50% is Low, 50% - 80% is Medium and &gt; 80% is High.</p>
<p>With Band Chart, you can display your survey results as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/display_survey_results.jpg" alt="Display Survey Results" />
<p>Create a Line Chart from your data.</p>
<img src="images/create_line_chart.jpg" alt="Create Line Chart" />
<p>Change the chart type to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>East and West Series to Line with Markers.</li>
<li>Low, Medium and High Series to Stacked Column.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/change_the_chart_type.jpg" alt="Change the Chart Type" />
<p>Your chart looks as follows.</p>
<img src="images/chart_looks.jpg" alt="charts" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on one of the columns.</li>
<li>Change gap width to 0% in Format Data Series.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/formating_data_series.jpg" alt="Format Data Series" />
<p>You will get Bands instead of columns.</p>
<img src="images/bands.jpg" alt="Bands" />
<p>To make the chart more presentable &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Add Chart Title.</li>
<li>Adjust Vertical Axis range.</li>
<li>Change the colors of the bands to Green-Yellow-Red.</li>
<li>Add Labels to bands.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is the Band Chart with the defined boundaries and the survey results represented across the bands. One can quickly and clearly make out from the chart that while the survey results for the region West are satisfactory, those for the region East have a decline in the last quarter and need attention.</p>
<img src="images/band_charts.jpg" alt="Band Chart" />
<h2>Thermometer Chart</h2>
<p>When you have to represent a target value and an actual value, you can easily create a Thermometer Chart in Excel that emphatically shows these values.</p>
<p>With Thermometer chart, you can display your data as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/thermometer_chart.jpg" alt="Thermometer Chart" />
<p>Arrange your data as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/arrange_your_data.jpg" alt="Arrange your Data" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the data.</li>

<h2>Gantt Chart</h2>
<p>A Gantt chart is a chart in which a series of horizontal lines shows the amount of work done in certain periods of time in relation to the amount of work planned for those periods.</p>
<p>In Excel, you can create a Gantt chart by customizing a Stacked Bar chart type so that it depicts tasks, task duration, and hierarchy. An Excel Gantt chart typically uses days as the unit of time along the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>Consider the following data where the column &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Task represents the Tasks in the project</li>
<li>Start represents number of days from the Start Date of the project</li>
<li>Duration represents the duration of the Task</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Start of any Task is Start of previous Task &plus; Duration. This is the case when the Tasks are in hierarchy.</p>

<h2>Waterfall Chart</h2>
<p>Waterfall Chart is one of the most popular visualization tools used in small and large businesses. Waterfall charts are ideal for showing how you have arrived at a net value such as net income, by breaking down the cumulative effect of positive and negative contributions.</p>
<p>Excel 2016 provides Waterfall Chart type. If you are using earlier versions of Excel, you can still create a Waterfall Chart using Stacked Column Chart.</p>
<p>The columns are color coded so that you can quickly tell positive from negative numbers. The initial and the final value columns start on the horizontal axis, while the intermediate values are floating columns. Because of this look, Waterfall Charts are also called Bridge Charts.</p>
<p>Consider the following data.</p>
<img src="images/waterfall_chart.jpg" alt="Waterfall Chart" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Prepare the data for Waterfall Chart</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the column Net Cash Flow is to the left of the Months Column (This is because you will not include this column while creating the chart)</p></li>
<li><p>Add 2 columns – Increase and Decrease for positive and negative cash flows respectively</p></li>
<li><p>Add a column Start - the first column in the chart with the start value in the Net Cash Flow</p></li>
<li><p>Add a column End - the last column in the chart with the end value in the Net Cash Flow</p></li>
<li><p>Add a column Float – that supports the intermediate columns</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the values for these columns as follows</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/compute_values.jpg" alt="Compute Values" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In the Float column, insert a row in the beginning and at the end. Place n arbitrary value 50000. This just to have some space to the left and right of the chart</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The data will be as follows.</p>
<img src="images/float_column.jpg" alt="Float Column" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the cells C2:H18 (Exclude Net Cash Flow column)</li>
<li>Create Stacked Column Chart</li>

<h2>PivotCharts</h2>
<p>Pivot Charts are used to graphically summarize data and explore complicated data.</p>
<p>A PivotChart shows Data Series, Categories, and Chart Axes the same way a standard chart does. Additionally, it also gives you interactive filtering controls right on the chart so that you can quickly analyze a subset of your data.</p>
<p>PivotCharts are useful when you have data in a huge PivotTable, or many complex worksheet data that includes text and numbers. A PivotChart can help you make sense of this data.</p>
<p>You can create a PivotChart from</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A PivotTable.</li>
<li>A Data Table as a standalone without PivotTable.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Data Validation</h1>
<p>Data Validation is a very useful and easy to use tool in Excel with which you can set data validations on the data that is entered that is entered into your Worksheet.</p>
<p>For any cell on the worksheet, you can</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Display an input message on what needs to be entered into it.</li>
<li>Restrict the values that get entered.</li>
<li>Provide a list of values to choose from.</li>
<li>Display an error message and reject an invalid data entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the following Risk Tracker that can be used to enter and track the identified Risks information.</p>
<img src="images/risk_tracker.jpg" alt="Risk Tracker" />
<p>In this tracker, the data that is entered into the following columns is validated with preset data constraints and the entered data is accepted only when it meets the validation criteria. Otherwise, you will get an error message.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Probability</li>
<li>Impact</li>
<li>Risk Category</li>
<li>Risk Source</li>
<li>Status</li>
</ul>
<p>The column Risk Exposure will have calculated values and you cannot enter any data. Even the column <b>S. No.</b> is set to have calculated values that are adjusted even if you delete a row.</p>
<p>Now, you will learn how to set up such a worksheet.</p>
<h2>Prepare the Structure for the Worksheet</h2>
<p>To prepare the structure for the worksheet &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<p>At this point, you need to remember two things &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You need to set the criteria for maximum number of cells that are possible to be used. In our example, it can vary from 10 – 100 based on where the worksheet will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>You should not set the criteria for unwanted range of cells or for the entire column. This will unnecessarily increases the file size. It is called excess formatting. If you get a worksheet from an outside source, you have to remove the excess formatting, which you will learn in the chapter on <a href="excel_data_analysis_inquire.html">Inquire</a> in this tutorial.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the steps given below &minus;</p>

<h1>Excel Data Financial Analysis</h1>
<p>You can perform financial analysis with Excel in an easy way. Excel provides you several financial functions such as PMT, PV, NPV, XNPV, IRR, MIRR, XIRR, and so on that enable you to quickly arrive at the financial analysis results.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn where and how you can use these functions for your analysis.</p>
<h3>What is Annuity?</h3>
<p>An annuity is a series of constant cash payments made over a continuous period. For example, savings for retirement, insurance payments, home loan, mortgage, etc. In annuity functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A positive number represents cash received.</li>
<li>A negative number represents cash paid out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Present Value of a series of Future Payments</h2>
<p>The present value is the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now. You can calculate the present value using the Excel functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>PV</b> &minus; Calculates the present value of an investment by using an interest rate and a series of future payments (negative values) and income (positive values). At least one of the cash flows must be positive and at least one must be negative.</p></li>
<li><p><b>NPV</b> &minus; Calculates the net present value of an investment by using a discount rate and a series of periodic future payments (negative values) and income (positive values).</p></li>
<li><p><b>XNPV</b> &minus; Calculates the net present value for a schedule of cash flows that is not necessarily periodic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note that</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>PV cash flows must be constant whereas NPV cash flows can be variable.</p></li>
<li><p>PV cash flows can be either at the beginning or at the end of the period whereas NPV cash flows must be at the end of the period.</p></li>
<li><p>NPV cash flows must be periodic whereas XNPV cash flows need not be periodic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, you will understand how to work with PV. You will learn about NPV in a later section.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose you are buying a refrigerator. The salesperson tells you that the price of the refrigerator is 32000, but you have an option to pay out the amount in 8 years with an interest rate of 13% per annum and yearly payments of 6000. You also have an option to make the payments either at the beginning or end of each year.</p>
<p>You want to know which of these options is beneficial for you.</p>
<p>You can use Excel function PV &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
PV (rate, nper, pmt, [fv ], [type])
</pre>
<p>To calculate present value with payments at the end of each year, omit type or specify 0 for type.</p>
<p>To calculate present value with payments at the end of each year, specify 1 for type.</p>
<img src="images/payments.jpg" alt="Payments" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/payments_result.jpg" alt="Payments Result" />
<p>Therefore,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>If you make the payment now, you need to pay 32,000 of present value.</li>
<li>If you opt for yearly payments with payment at the end of the year, you need to pay 28, 793 of present value.</li>
<li>If you opt for yearly payments with payment at the end of the year, you need to pay 32,536 of present value.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can clearly see that option 2 is beneficial for you.</p>
<h2>What is EMI?</h2>
<p>An Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is defined by Investopedia as "A fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. Equated monthly installments are used to pay off both interest and principal each month, so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full."</p>
<h3>EMI on a Loan</h3>
<p>In Excel, you can calculate the EMI on a loan with the PMT function.</p>
<p>Suppose, you want to take a home loan of 5000000 with an annual interest rate of 11.5% and the term of the loan for 25 years. You can find your EMI as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Calculate interest rate per month (Interest Rate per Annum/12)</li>
<li>Calculate number of monthly payments (No. of years &ast; 12)</li>
<li>Use PMT function to calculate EMI</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/use_pmt_function.jpg" alt="Use PMT Function" />
<p>As you observe,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Present Value (PV) is the loan amount.</li>
<li>Future Value (FV) is 0 as at the end of the term the loan amount should be 0.</li>
<li>Type is 1 as the EMIs are paid at the beginning of each month.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/present_and_future_value.jpg" alt="Present and Future Value" />
<h2>Monthly Payment of Principal and Interest on a Loan</h2>
<p>EMI includes both-interest and a part payment of principal. As the time increases, these two components of EMI will vary, reducing the balance.</p>
<p>To get</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The interest part of your monthly payments, you can use the Excel IPMT function.</p></li>
<li><p>The payment of principal part of your monthly payments, you can use the Excel PPMT function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you have taken a loan of 1,000,000 for a term of 8 months at the rate of 16% per annum. You can get values for the EMI, the decreasing interest amounts, the increasing payment of principal amounts and the diminishing loan balance over the 8 months. At the end of 8 months, loan balance will be 0.</p>
<p>Follow the procedure given below.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Calculate the EMI as follows.</p>
<img src="images/calculate_emi.jpg" alt="Calculate EMI" />
<p>This results in an EMI of Rs. 13261.59.</p>
<img src="images/emi_result.jpg" alt="EMI Result" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Next calculate the interest and principal parts of the EMI for the 8 months as shown below.</p>
<img src="images/calculate_interest_and_principal.jpg" alt="Calculate Interest and Principal" />
<p>You will get the following results.</p>
<img src="images/calculate_interest_and_principal_result.jpg" alt="Calculate Interest and Principal Result" />
<h3>Interest and Principal paid between two Periods</h3>
<p>You can compute the interest and principal paid between two periods, inclusive.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Compute the cumulative interest paid between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> months using the CUMIPMT function.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify the result summing up the interest values for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> months.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the cumulative principal paid between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> months using the CUMPRINC function.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify the result summing up the principal values for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> months.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/summing_up.jpg" alt="Summing Up" />
<p>You will get the following results.</p>
<img src="images/summing_up_result.jpg" alt="Summing Up Result" />
<p>You can see that your calculations match with your verification results.</p>
<h2>Calculating Interest Rate</h2>
<p>Suppose you take a loan of 100,000 and you want to pay back in 15 months with a maximum monthly payment of 12000. You might want to know the interest rate at which you have to pay.</p>
<p>Find the interest rate with the Excel RATE function &minus;</p>
<img src="images/calculating_interest_rate.jpg" alt="Calculating Interest Rate" />
<p>You will get the result as 8%.</p>
<img src="images/calculating_interest_rate_result.jpg" alt="Calculating Interest Rate Result" />
<h2>Calculating Term of Loan</h2>
<p>Suppose you take a loan of 100,000 at the interest rate 10%. You want a maximum monthly payment of 15,000. You might want to know how long it will take for you to clear the loan.</p>
<p>Find the number of payments with Excel NPER function</p>
<img src="images/excel_nper_function.jpg" alt="Excel Nper Function" />
<p>You will get the result as 12 months.</p>
<img src="images/excel_nper_function_result.jpg" alt="Excel Nper Function result" />
<h2>Decisions on Investments</h2>
<p>When you want to make an investment, you compare the different options and choose the one that yields better returns. Net present value is useful in comparing cash flows over a period of time and deciding which one is better. The cash flows can occur at regular, periodical intervals or at irregular intervals.</p>
<p>First, we consider the case of <b>regular, periodical cash flows</b>.</p>
<p>The net present value of a sequence of cash flows received at different points in time in n years from now (n can be a fraction) is <b>1/(1 + r)<sup>n</sup></b>, where r is the annual interest rate.</p>
<p>Consider the following two investments over a period of 3 years.</p>
<img src="images/decisions_on_investments.jpg" alt="Decisions on Investments" />
<p>At face value, Investment 1 looks better than Investment 2. However, you can decide on which investment is better only when you know the true worth of the investment as of today. You can use the NPV function to calculate the returns.</p>
<p>The cash flows can occur</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>At the end of every year.</li>
<li>At the beginning of every year.</li>
<li>In the middle of every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>NPV function assumes that the cash flows are at the end of the year. If the cash flows occur at different times then you have to take into account that particular factor along with the calculation with NPV.</p>
<p>Suppose the cash flows occur at the end of the year. Then you can straight away use the NPV function.</p>
<img src="images/npv_function.jpg" alt="NPV Function" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/npv_function_result.jpg" alt="NPV Function Result" />
<p>As you observe NPV for Investment 2 is higher than that for Investment 1. Hence, Investment 2 is a better choice. You got this result as cash out flows for Investment 2 are at later periods as compared to that of Investment 1.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows at the Beginning of the Year</h2>
<p>Suppose the cash flows occur at the beginning of every year. In such a case, you should not include the first cash flow in NPV calculation as it already represents the current value. You need to add the first cash flow to the NPV obtained from rest of the cash flows to get the net present value.</p>
<img src="images/cash_flows_at_beginning_year.jpg" alt="Cash Flows at Beginning Year" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/cash_flows_at_beginning_year_result.jpg" alt="Cash Flows at Beginning Year Result" />
<h2>Cash Flows in the Middle of the Year</h2>
<p>Suppose the cash flows occur in the middle of every year. In such a case, you need to multiply the NPV obtained from the cash flows by $\sqrt{1+r}$ to get the net present value.</p>
<img src="images/cash_flows_in_middle_year.jpg" alt="Cash Flows in Middle Year" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/cash_flows_in_middle_year_result.jpg" alt="Cash Flows in Middle Year Result" />
<h2>Cash Flows at Irregular Intervals</h2>
<p>If you want to calculate the net present value with irregular cash flows, i.e. cash flows occurring at random times, the calculation is a bit complex.</p>
<p>However, in Excel, you can easily do such a calculation with XNPV function.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Arrange your data with the dates and the cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The first date in your data should be the earliest of all the dates. The other dates can occur in any order.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Use the XNPV function to calculate the net present value.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/cash_flows_at_irregular_intervals.jpg" alt="Cash Flows at Irregular Intervals" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/cash_flows_at_irregular_intervals_result.jpg" alt="Cash Flows at Irregular Intervals Result" />
<p>Suppose today’s date is 15<sup>th</sup> March, 2015. As you observe, all the dates of cash flows are of later dates. If you want to find the net present value as of today, include it in the data at the top and specify 0 for the cash flow.</p>
<img src="images/include_date.jpg" alt="Include Date" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/include_date_result.jpg" alt="Include Date Result" />
<h2>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h2>
<p>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of an investment is the rate of interest at which NPV is 0. It is the rate value for which the present values of the positive cash flows exactly compensate the negative ones. When the discount rate is the IRR, the investment is perfectly indifferent, i.e. the investor is neither gaining nor losing money.</p>
<p>Consider the following cash flows, different interest rates and the corresponding NPV values.</p>
<img src="images/internal_rate_of_return.jpg" alt="Internal Rate of Return" />
<p>As you can observe between the values of interest rate 10% and 11%, the sign of NPV changes. When you fine-tune the interest rate to 10.53%, NPV is nearly 0. Hence, IRR is 10.53%.</p>
<h2>Determining IRR of Cash Flows for a Project</h2>
<p>You can calculate IRR of cash flows with Excel function IRR.</p>
<img src="images/calculate_irr.jpg" alt="Calculate IRR" />
<p>The IRR is 10.53% as you had seen in the previous section.</p>
<p>For the given cash flows, IRR may &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>exist and unique</li>
<li>exist and multiple</li>
<li>not exist</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unique IRR</h2>
<p>If IRR exists and is unique, it can be used to choose the best investment among several possibilities.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If the first cash flow is negative, it means the investor has the money and wants to invest. Then, the higher the IRR the better, since it represents the interest rate the investor is receiving.</p></li>
<li><p>If the first cash flow is positive, it means the investor needs money and is looking for a loan, the lower the IRR the better since it represents the interest rate the investor is paying.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To find if an IRR is unique or not, vary the guess value and calculate IRR. If IRR remains constant then it is unique.</p>
<img src="images/unique_irr.jpg" alt="Unique IRR" />
<p>As you observe, the IRR has a unique value for the different guess values.</p>
<img src="images/unique_value.jpg" alt="Unique Value" />
<h2>Multiple IRRs</h2>
<p>In certain cases, you may have multiple IRRs. Consider the following cash flows. Calculate IRR with different guess values.</p>
<img src="images/multiple_irrs.jpg" alt="Multiple IRRs" />
<p>You will get the following results &minus;</p>
<img src="images/multiple_irrs_result.jpg" alt="Multiple IRRs result" />
<p>You can observe that there are two IRRs - -9.59% and 216.09%. You can verify these two IRRs calculating NPV.</p>
<img src="images/calculating_npv.jpg" alt="Calculating NPV" />
<p>For both -9.59% and 216.09%, NPV is 0.</p>
<h2>No IRRs</h2>
<p>In certain cases, you may not have IRR. Consider the following cash flows. Calculate IRR with different guess values.</p>
<img src="images/no_irrs.jpg" alt="No IRRs" />
<p>You will get the result as &#35;NUM for all the guess values.</p>
<img src="images/no_irrs_result.jpg" alt="No IRRs result" />
<p>The result &#35;NUM means that there is no IRR for the cash flows considered.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows Patterns and IRR</h2>
<p>If there is only one sign change in the cash flows, such as from negative to positive or positive to negative, then a unique IRR is guaranteed. For example, in capital investments, the first cash flow will be negative, while the rest of the cash flows will be positive. In such cases, unique IRR exists.</p>
<p>If there is more than one sign change in the cash flows, IRR may not exist. Even if it exists, it may not be unique.</p>
<h2>Decisions based on IRRs</h2>
<p>Many analysts prefer to use IRR and it is a popular profitability measure because, as a percentage, it is easy to understand and easy to compare to the required return. However, there are certain problems while making decisions with IRR. If you rank with IRRs and make decisions based on these ranks, you may end up with wrong decisions.</p>
<p>You have already seen that NPV will enable you to make financial decisions. However, IRR and NPV will not always lead to the same decision when projects are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p><b>Mutually exclusive projects</b> are those for which the selection of one project precludes the acceptance of another. When projects that are being compared are mutually exclusive, a ranking conflict may arise between NPV and IRR. If you have to choose between project A and project B, NPV may suggest acceptance of project A whereas IRR may suggest project B.</p>
<p>This type of conflict between NPV and IRR may arise because of one of the following reasons &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The projects are of greatly different sizes, or</li>
<li>The timing of the cash flows are different.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Projects of significant size difference</h3>
<img src="images/significant_size.jpg" alt="Significant Size" />
<p>If you want to make a decision by IRR, project A yields a return of 100 and Project B a return of 50. Hence, investment on project A looks profitable. However, this is a wrong decision because of the difference in the scale of projects.</p>
<p>Consider &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You have 1000 to invest.</p></li>
<li><p>If you invest entire 1000 on project A, you get a return of 100.</p></li>
<li><p>If you invest 100 on project B, you will still have 900 in your hand that you can invest on another project, say project C. Suppose you get a return of 20% on project C, then the total return on project B and project C is 230, which is way ahead in profitability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, NPV is a better way for decision making in such cases.</p>
<h3>Projects with different cash flows timings</h3>
<img src="images/different_cash_flows.jpg" alt="Different Cash Flows" />
<p>Again, if you consider IRR to decide, project B would be the choice. However, project A has a higher NPV and is an ideal choice.</p>
<h2>IRR of Irregularly Spaced Cash Flows (XIRR)</h2>
<p>Your cash flows may sometimes be irregularly spaced. In such a case, you cannot use IRR as IRR requires equally spaced time intervals. You can use XIRR instead, which takes into account the dates of the cash flows along with the cash flows.</p>
<img src="images/xirr.jpg" alt="XIRR" />
<p>The Internal Rate of Return that results in is 26.42%.</p>
<img src="images/internal_rate.jpg" alt="Internal Rate" />
<h2>Modified IRR (MIRR)</h2>
<p>Consider a case when your finance rate is different from your reinvestment rate. If you calculate Internal Rate of Return with IRR, it assumes same rate for both finance and reinvestment. Further, you might also get multiple IRRs.</p>
<p>For example, consider the cash flows given below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/mirr.jpg" alt="MIRR" />
<p>As you observe, NPV is 0 more than once, resulting in multiple IRRs. Further, reinvestment rate is not taken into account. In such cases, you can use modified IRR (MIRR).</p>
<img src="images/modified_irr.jpg" alt="Modified IRR" />
<p>You will get a result of 7% as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/modified_irr_result.jpg" alt="Modified IRR Result" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Unlike IRR, MIRR will always be unique.</p>
<h1>Working with Multiple Sheets</h1>
<p>In certain situations, you might have to</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Set up workbooks in which several worksheets have a similar format or structure.</li>
<li>Get information for these worksheets from another worksheet.</li>
<li>Summarize the results from these worksheets into a summary worksheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you might have to track sales information region wise and month wise in separate worksheets. The price of each product is taken from the product catalog that is set up across the company in a separate worksheet. Finally, you have to summarize the results across all the regions into a summary sheet.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how you can accomplish this in easy steps. You are going to summarize results from April 2015 to March 2016, i.e. financial year 2015-16.</p>
<h3>The First Step</h3>
<p>The first step is to set up a product catalog. Follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Start with a blank workbook.</li>
<li>Set up product catalog worksheet with products and prices.</li>
<li>Name the worksheet <b>Product Catalog</b>.</li>
<li>Assume the catalog is revised on the first of every month.</li>
<li>Provide a place holder for last updated on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The price of a product at selling time is determined by the current cost of the product.</p>
<img src="images/first_step.jpg" alt="First Step" />
<h2>Multiple Worksheets with same Structure</h2>
<p>Next, you have to set up worksheets for the Regions – East, North, South, and West, in that order with same structure.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Add 4 blank worksheets.</li>
<li>Name the worksheets East, North, South and West.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/multiple_worksheets_with_same_structure.jpg" alt="Multiple Worksheets with same Structure" />
<p>These four worksheets should have the same structure.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the tab East. The East worksheet opens.</li>
<li>Press the shift key and click on the tab West. All the 4 tabs will be selected.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_tabs.jpg" alt="Select Tabs" />
<p>Now, whatever editing you do in the East worksheet will get automatically reflected in the other three selected worksheets.</p>
<p>In the East worksheet,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Add the column headers – S. No., Month, Product, Price, No. of Units, Total Amount.</li>
<li>Add the S. No., Month April and the 4 Product Names.</li>
<li>Format the Table.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/east_worksheet.jpg" alt="East Worksheet" />
<p>The same structure appears in the other worksheets North, South and West.</p>
<h2>Creating a Formula across Multiple Worksheets</h2>
<p>To create a formula across multiple worksheets &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Define names for the price values of the products in the product catalog worksheet.</li>
<li>Set the Scope as Workbook for all the names.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/create_formula.jpg" alt="Create Formula" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Once again select all the four worksheets – East, North, South and West.</li>
<li>In the East worksheet, for each product, in the price column, give the formula as the Price Value Name.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we defined earlier, the price of a product is as per the product catalog that is updated on the first of every month.</p>
<img src="images/product_price.jpg" alt="Product Price" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Repeat the same steps for each Month</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/repeat_same_steps.jpg" alt="Repeat Same Steps" />
<p>Therefore, for the worksheets for the regions East, North, South, and West, you have successfully set the same structure and placed the price information for each product based on the month from product catalog worksheet.</p>
<p>The Product Catalog can be in another Workbook too.</p>
<h3>Calculations in the Worksheets</h3>
<p>The next step is to fill in the information of No. of Units sold for each Product in each Month and in each Region. Therefore, you need to work separately on these worksheets.</p>
<p>For each region, for each product &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Fill No. of Units sold.</li>
<li>Calculate the corresponding Total Amount as Price&ast;No. of Units.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/calculate_total_amount.jpg" alt="Calculate Total Amount" />
<p>In each worksheet (East, North, South and West), calculate subtotals month-wise &minus;</p>
<img src="images/calculate_subtotals.jpg" alt="Calculate Subtotals" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can use Subtotal on a single worksheet but not on multiple worksheets. Hence, you have to repeat this step for North, South and West worksheets.</p>
<img src="images/subtotal.jpg" alt="Subtotal" />

<h1>Excel Data Analysis - Formula Auditing</h1>
<p>You might want to check formulas for accuracy or find the source of an error. Excel Formula Auditing commands provide you an easy way to find</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Which cells are contributing in the calculation of a formula in the active cell.</li>
<li>Which formulas are referring to the active cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings are shown graphically by arrow lines that makes the visualization easy. You can display all the formulas in the active worksheet with a single command. If your formulas refer to cells in a different workbook, open that workbook also. Excel cannot go to a cell in a workbook that is not open.</p>
<h2>Setting the Display Options</h2>
<p>You need to check whether the display options for the workbooks you are using are correctly set.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click <b>FILE &gt; Options</b>.</li>
<li>In the Excel Options dialog box, click Advanced.</li>
<li>In Display options for the workbook &minus;
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the workbook.</li>
<li>Check that under For objects, show, All is selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat this step for all the workbooks you are auditing.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/setting_the_display_options.jpg" alt="Setting the Display Options" />
<h2>Tracing Precedents</h2>
<p>Precedent cells are those cells that are referred to by a formula in the active cell.</p>
<p>In the following example, the active cell is C2. In C2, you have the formula <b>=B2&ast;C4</b>.</p>
<p>B2 and C4 are precedent cells for C2.</p>
<img src="images/tracing_precedents.jpg" alt="Tracing Precedents" />
<p>To trace the precedents of the cell C2,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click in the cell C2.</li>
<li>Click the Formulas tab.</li>
<li>Click Trace Precedents in the Formula Auditing group.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/trace_precedents.jpg" alt="Trace Precedents" />
<p>Two arrows, one from B2 to C2 and another from C4 to C2 will be displayed, tracing the precedents.</p>
<img src="images/two_arrows_displayed.jpg" alt="Two Arrows Displayed" />
<p>Note that for tracing precedents of a cell, the cell should have a formula with valid references. Otherwise, you will get an error message.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click in a cell that does not contain a formula or click in an empty cell.</li>
<li>Click Trace Precedents in the Formula Auditing group.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get a message.</p>

<img src="images/removing_arrows.jpg" alt="Removing Arrows" />
<p>All the arrows in the worksheet will disappear.</p>
<h2>Tracing Dependents</h2>
<p>Dependent cells contain formulas that refer to other cells. That means, if the active cell contributes to a formula in another cell, the other cell is a dependent cell on the active cell.</p>
<p>In the example below, C2 has the formula <b>=B2&ast;C4</b>. Therefore, C2 is a dependent cell on the cells B2 and C4</p>
<img src="images/tracing_dependents.jpg" alt="Tracing Dependents" />
<p>To trace the dependents of the cell B2,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click in the cell B2.</li>
<li>Click the Formulas tab.</li>
<li>Click Trace Dependents in the Formula Auditing group.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/trace_dependents_in_formula_auditing.jpg" alt="Trace Dependents in Formula Auditing" />

<p>To trace the dependents of the cell C4 &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click in the cell C4.</li>
<li>Click the Formula tab &gt; Trace Dependents in the Formula Auditing group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another arrow appears from C4 to C2, showing C2 is dependent on C4 also.</p>
<img src="images/trace_dependents_of_cell.jpg" alt="Trace Dependents of Cell" />
<p>Click <b>Remove Arrows</b> in the Formula Auditing group. All the arrows in the worksheet will disappear.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; For tracing dependents of a cell, the cell should be referenced by a formula in another cell. Otherwise, you will get an error message.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click in the cell B6 is not referenced by any formula or click in any empty cell.</li>
<li>Click Trace Dependents in the Formula Auditing group. You will get a message.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/click_trace_dependents.jpg" alt="Click Trace Dependents" />
<h3>Working with Formulae</h3>
<p>You have understood the concept of Precedents and Dependents. Now, consider a worksheet with several formulae.</p>

<li>The reference appears in the Reference box.</li>
<li>Click OK. The worksheet containing that precedent appears.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluating a Formula</h2>
<p>To find how a complex formula in a cell works step by step, you can use Evaluate Formula command.</p>
<p>Consider the formula NPV (Middle Year) in the cell C14. The formula is</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>=SQRT (1  &plus; C2)&ast;C10</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click in the cell C14.</li>
<li>Click the FORMULAS tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Evaluate Formula in the Formula Auditing group. The Evaluate Formula dialog box appears.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/evaluating_formula.jpg" alt="Evaluating Formula" />
<p>In the <b>Evaluate Formula</b> dialog box, the formula is displayed in the box under Evaluation. By clicking the <b>Evaluate</b> button several times, the formula gets evaluated step-wise. The expression with an underline will always be executed next.</p>
<img src="images/evaluate_formula.jpg" alt="Evaluate Formula" />
<p>Here, C2 is underlined in the formula. So, it is evaluated in the next step. Click <b>Evaluate</b>.</p>
<img src="images/click_evaluate_button.jpg" alt="Click Evaluate Button" />
<p>Cell C2 has value 0.2. Hence, C2 will be evaluated as 0.2. <b>1&plus;0.2</b> is underlined showing it as the next step. Click <b>Evaluate</b>.</p>
<img src="images/click_evaluate.jpg" alt="Click Evaluate" />
<p>1&plus;0.2 will be evaluated as 1.2. <b>SQRT(1.2)</b> is underlined showing it as next step. Click <b>Evaluate</b>.</p>

<p>Your data analysis might depend on various external data sources. In Excel, you can import data from different data sources, such as Microsoft Access Database, Web Pages, Text Files, SQL Server Table, SQL Server Analysis Cube, XML File, etc.</p>
<p>You can import any number of data tables simultaneously from a database. When you are importing multiple tables from a relational database such as Access, the existing relationships among the tables will be retained in Excel also. While importing the data, you can also optionally create a PivotTable or PivotChart or Power View report based on that data.</p>
<p>You can just create a data connection with a data source, or import the data into Excel. If you import the data into Excel, the data tables are added to the Data Model in Excel.</p>
<h3>Data Model</h3>
<p>Data Model in Excel is used to integrate data from multiple tables in the current workbook and / or from the imported data and / or from the data sources connected to the workbook through data connections. Data model is used transparently in PivotTable, PivotChart, PowerPivot and Power View reports.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can create a Data Model while importing data, or from the Excel tables in the workbook.</p></li>
<li><p>The data tables in the Data Model can be viewed either in Data View or Diagram View.</p></li>
<li><p>With a Data Model, you can create relationships among the data tables.</p></li>
<li><p>You can either use the Create Relationship command or just click and drag and connect the fields in the two tables that define the relationship in the diagram view of the Data Model.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Exploring Data with PivotTable</h3>
<p>As you can integrate the Data Model with a PivotTable, you can do extensive data analysis by collating, connecting, summarizing and reporting data from several different sources. As you can import tables from external data sources and create a PivotTable, it is possible to have automatic updates of the values in the PivotTable whenever the data in the connected data sources is updated.</p>
<p>You can create a PivotTable with the fields from multiple tables, provided the tables have relationships defined. If a relationship does not exist, Excel prompts you to create one and you can do so from the PivotTable itself. The relationship that you so define is reflected in the Data Model.</p>
<h3>Exploring Data with PowerPivot</h3>
<p>You can use PowerPivot to access, analyze and report data from various data sources. PowerPivot can help you handle large data with ease and produce fascinating analysis reports.</p>
<p>PowerPivot provides you commands to manage the Data Model, add Excel tables to Data Model, to add calculated fields in the Data Tables, to define KPIs, etc.</p>
<h3>Exploring Data with Power View</h3>
<p>Power View provides interactive exploration, visualization and analysis of large data. Owing to its versatile visualization options, you can definitely find the one that gives your data the perfect platform wherein you can explore the data, summarize and report.</p>
<p>Ranging from Tables to Maps, it is just a play for you to visualize your data, filter it, analyze it, and report it interactively. Moreover, you can have multiple visualizations on the same Power View sheet that reflect and highlight values, when you click on a data point in any one of them.</p>
<p>You can explore data in Power View with a table, a matrix, a card, different chart types, multiples, maps and tiles. You will get fascinated with the versatility of these different views once you get hands-on experience. This is because it is easy to produce interactive reports highlighting significant values and dynamically switching across the views.</p>
<h3>Exploring Data with Hierarchies</h3>
<p>If your data has hierarchies, they can be either defined in the Data Model that is reflected in the Power View or build the hierarchies in Power View itself.</p>
<p>Once a hierarchy is defined, you can drill-up and drill-down the hierarchy, displaying the required data.</p>
<h2>Aesthetic Power View Reports</h2>
<p>You can arrive at a report layout based on what you want to present in Power View. You can add a background image that reflects your company logo or your corporate view. Optionally, you can format the background of the report to give it an elegant look.</p>
<p>You can select a theme for your report that best portrays your data. You can change the font and text size so that your report becomes easily readable.</p>
<h3>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h3>
<p>Key Performance Indicators are commonly used to gauge the performance. In Excel, you define and portray KPIs in PowerPivot or Power View. The graphical presentation of KPIs will uplift your reports.</p>
<h1>Advanced Data Analysis - Data Consolidation</h1>
<p>You might have come across different situations wherein you have to present consolidated data. The source of the data could be from one place, or several places. Another challenge could be that the data might be updated by other people from time to time.</p>
<p>You need to know how you can set up a summary worksheet that consolidates the data from the sources that you set up, whenever you want. In Excel, you can easily perform this task in a few steps with the <b>Data Tool – Consolidate</b>.</p>
<h2>Preparing Data for Consolidation</h2>
<p>Before you begin consolidating the data, make sure that there is consistency across the data sources. This means that the data is arranged as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Each range of data is on a separate worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Each range of data is in list format, with labels in the first row.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, you can have labels for the categories, if applicable, in the first column.</p></li>
<li><p>All the ranges of data have the same layout.</p></li>
<li><p>All the ranges of data contain similar facts.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no blank rows or columns within each range.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In case the data sources are external, ensure usage of a predefined layout in the form of an Excel template.</p>
<p>Suppose you have the sales data of various commodities from each of the regions – East, North, South, and West. You might need to consolidate this data and present a product wise summary of sales from time to time. Preparation includes the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>One worksheet per region – i.e. four worksheets with names East, North, South, and West. These could be in the same workbook or different workbooks.</p></li>
<li><p>Each worksheet has same layout, representing the details of product, number of units, and amount.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to consolidate the data product wise. Hence, ensure that the column with the label Product is the first column and it contains the Product labels.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/preparing_data_for_consolidation.jpg" alt="Preparing Data for Consolidation" />
<h2>Consolidating Data in the Same Workbook</h2>
<p>If you have all the data, that you have to consolidate, in the same workbook, proceed as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Ensure that data of each region is on a separate worksheet.</p>
<img src="images/separate_worksheet.jpg" alt="Separate Worksheet" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Add a new worksheet and name it Summary.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Click the Summary worksheet.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Click the cell where you want to place the summary results.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Click the <b>DATA</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Click the <b>Consolidate</b> button in the <b>Data Tools</b> group.</p>
<p>The <b>Consolidate</b> dialog box appears.</p>
<img src="images/consolidate_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Consolidate Dialog Box" />
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Select <b>Sum</b> from the dropdown list under <b>Function</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Select the data from each worksheet as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the icon in the box under Reference.</li>
<li>Select the worksheet – East.</li>
<li>Select the data range.</li>
<li>Again, click the icon in the box under Reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected range appears in the Reference box &minus;</p>
<img src="images/reference_box.jpg" alt="Reference Box" />
<p><b>Step 9</b> &minus; Click the <b>Add</b> button to the right of the box. The selected data range appears in the box under <b>All References</b>.</p>
<img src="images/all_references.jpg" alt="All References" />
<p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; Repeat Steps 1-5 for the rest of the data worksheets – North, South, and West. The Consolidate dialog box looks as follows.</p>
<img src="images/data_worksheets.jpg" alt="Data Worksheets" />
<p>You can see that the data ranges appear worksheet wise in alphabetical order, in the box under <b>All references</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 11</b> &minus; Check the boxes <b>Top row</b> and <b>Left column</b> under <b>Use labels in</b>. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/use_labels_in.jpg" alt="Use Labels in" />
<p>Your data is summarized product wise for the regions – East, North, South and West.</p>
<img src="images/regions.jpg" alt="Regions" />
<p>You can repeat the steps given above to refresh your summary results manually, whenever you need them.</p>
<h2>Consolidating Data Automatically</h2>
<p>Suppose you want your summary sheet to be updated automatically, whenever there are changes in the data. To accomplish this, you need to have links to the source data.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Check the box - <b>Create links to source data</b> in the Consolidate dialog box and click OK.</p>
<img src="images/consolidating_data_automatically.jpg" alt="Consolidating Data Automatically" />
<p>Your summary results appear with an outline as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/outline.jpg" alt="Outline" />
<p>You will observe that a new column is inserted to the right of the column named Product.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the &plus; sign on the outline in the row containing the Product value named Soap. You can see that the new column contains the consolidated value for each set of product values, region wise.</p>
<img src="images/consolidated_value.jpg" alt="Consolidated Value" />
<h2>Consolidating Data from Different Workbooks</h2>
<p>In the previous example, all the data that you need to summarize is in the same workbook. However, it is likely that the data is maintained separately for each region and is updated region wise. In such a case, you can consolidate the data as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Open the workbooks containing the data, say, workbooks – East-Sales, North-Sales, South-Sales and West-Sales.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Open a new workbook.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; On a new worksheet, click a cell where you want the summary to appear.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Click the DATA tab on the Ribbon.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Click Consolidate in the Data Tools box.</p>
<p>A <b>Consolidate</b> dialog box appears. In the Consolidate dialog box &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select Sum from the dropdown list in the box under Function.</li>
<li>Click the icon in the box under <b>Reference</b>.</li>
<li>Select the workbook – East-Sales.xlsx.</li>
<li>Select the data range.</li>
<li>Again, click the icon in the box under Reference.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Add</b> button to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Consolidate dialog box looks as follows &minus;</p>

<li>Click the icon to the right of the box under References.</li>
<li>Select the workbook – North-Sales.xlsx.</li>
<li>Select the data range.</li>
<li>Again, click the icon to the right of the box under References.</li>
<li>Click Add.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Repeat the steps 1–6 to add the data ranges from the workbooks – South-Sales.xlsx and West-Sales.xlsx.</p>
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Under <b>Use labels in</b>, check the following boxes.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Top row.</li>
<li>Left column.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Check the box <b>Create links to source data</b>.</p>
<p>Your Consolidate dialog box looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/create_links.jpg" alt="Create Links" />
<p>Your data is summarized in your workbook.</p>
<img src="images/consolidate_data_summarized.jpg" alt="Consolidate Data Summarized" />
<h1>Advanced Data Analysis - What-If Analysis</h1>
<p><b>What-if analysis</b> is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. You can use several different sets of values in one or more formulas to explore all the various results.</p>
<p>What-if analysis is useful in many situations while doing data analysis. For example &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can propose different budgets based on revenue.</p></li>
<li><p>You can predict the future values based on the given historical values.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are expecting a certain value as the result from a formula, you can find different sets of input values that produce the desired result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Excel provides you with the following What-if analysis tools that can be used based on your data analysis needs &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data Tables</li>
<li>Scenario Manager</li>
<li>Goal Seek</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Tables and Scenarios take sets of input values and project forward to determine possible results. Goal seek differs from Data Tables and Scenarios in that it takes a result and projects backwards to determine possible input values that produce that result.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will understand the possible situations where you can use the Whatif Analysis tools. For details on usage of these tools, refer to the later chapters in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Data Tables</h2>
<p>A <b>Data Table</b> is a range of cells in which you can change values in some of the cells and come up with different answers to a problem. For example, you might want to know how much loan you can afford for a home by analyzing different loan amounts and interest rates. You can put these different values along with the <b>PMT</b> function in a Data Table and get the desired result.</p>
<p>A Data Table works only with <b>one or two variables</b>, but it can accept many different values for those variables.</p>
<p>For the details on Data Tables, refer to the chapter – <a href="what_if_analysis_with_data_tables.html">What-If Analysis with Data Tables</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Scenario Manager</h2>
<p>A scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on a worksheet.</p>
<p>The key features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can create and save different groups of values on a worksheet and then switch to any of these new scenarios to view different results.</p></li>
<li><p>A scenario can have multiple variables, but it can accommodate only up to 32 values.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also create a scenario summary report, which combines all the scenarios on one worksheet. For example, you can create several different budget scenarios that compare various possible income levels and expenses, and then create a report that lets you compare the scenarios side-by-side.</p></li>
<li><p>Scenario Manager is a dialog box that allows you to save the values as a scenario and name the scenario.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the details on Scenarios, refer to the chapter – <a href="what_if_analysis_with_scenario_manager.html">What-If Analysis with Scenario Manager</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Goal Seek</h2>
<p>Goal Seek is useful if you know the result that you want from a formula, but not sure what input value the formula needs, to get that result. For example, if you want to borrow a loan and you know the loan amount, tenure of loan and the EMI that you can pay, you can use Goal Seek to find the interest rate at which you can avail the loan.</p>
<p>Goal Seek can be used only with one variable input value. If you have more than one variable for input values, you can use the Solver add-in.</p>
<p>For details on the usage of Goal Seek, refer to the chapter – <a href="what_if_analysis_with_goal_seek.html">What-If Analysis with Goal Seek</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Solver</h2>
<p>Solver comes with Excel as an add-in. You can use Solver to find an optimal value for a formula in a cell called the target cell on a worksheet.</p>
<p>Solver works with a group of cells that are related to the formula in the target cell. Solver adjusts the values in the adjustable cells that you specify, to produce the result that you specify, from the target cell formula.</p>
<p>For the details on the usage of Excel Solver add-in, refer to the chapter - <a href="advanced_data_analysis_optimization_with_excel_solver.html">Optimization with Excel Solver</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h1>What-If Analysis with Data Tables</h1>
<p>With a Data Table in Excel, you can easily vary one or two inputs and perform What-if analysis. A Data Table is a range of cells in which you can change values in some of the cells and come up with different answers to a problem.</p>
<p>There are two types of Data Tables &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>One-variable Data Tables</li>
<li>Two-variable Data Tables</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have more than two variables in your analysis problem, you need to use Scenario Manager Tool of Excel. For details, refer to the chapter – <a href="what_if_analysis_with_scenario_manager.html">What-If Analysis with Scenario Manager</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>One-variable Data Tables</h2>
<p>A one-variable Data Table can be used if you want to see how different values of one variable in one or more formulas will change the results of those formulas. In other words, with a one-variable Data Table, you can determine how changing one input changes any number of outputs. You will understand this with the help of an example.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>There is a loan of 5,000,000 for a tenure of 30 years. You want to know the monthly payments (EMI) for varied interest rates. You also might be interested in knowing the amount of interest and Principal that is paid in the second year.</p>
<h2>Analysis with One-variable Data Table</h2>
<p>Analysis with one-variable Data Table needs to be done in three steps &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Set the required background.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Create the Data Table.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Perform the Analysis.</p>
<p>Let us understand these steps in detail &minus;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Set the required background</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Assume that the interest rate is 12%.</p></li>
<li><p>List all the required values.</p></li>
<li><p>Name the cells containing the values, so that the formulas will have names instead of cell references.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the calculations for EMI, Cumulative Interest and Cumulative Principal with the Excel functions – PMT, CUMIPMT and CUMPRINC respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your worksheet should look as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/set_required_background.jpg" alt="Set Required Background" />
<p>You can see that the cells in column C are named as given in the corresponding cells in column D.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Create the Data Table</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Type the list of values i.e. interest rates that you want to substitute in the input cell down the column E as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/create_data_table.jpg" alt="Create Data Table" />
<ul class="list">
<p>As you observe, there is an empty row above the Interest Rate values. This row is for the formulas that you want to use.</p>
<li><p>Type the first function (<b>PMT</b>) in the cell one row above and one cell to the right of the column of values. Type the other functions (<b>CUMIPMT and CUMPRINC</b>) in the cells to the right of the first function.</p>
<p>Now, the two rows above the Interest Rate values look as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/type_functions.jpg" alt="Type Functions" />
<ul class="list">
<p>The Data Table looks as given below &minus;</p>
</ul>
<img src="images/below_data_table.jpg" alt="Below Data Table" />
<h3>Step 3: Do the analysis with the What-If Analysis Data Table Tool</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the range of cells that contains the formulas and values that you want to substitute, i.e. select the range – E2:H13.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the DATA tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click What-if Analysis in the Data Tools group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Data Table in the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/do_analysis.jpg" alt="Do Analysis" />
<p><b>Data Table</b> dialog box appears.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the icon in the Column input cell box.</li>
<li>Click the cell <b>Interest_Rate</b>, which is C2.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/data_table.jpg" alt="Data Table" />
<p>You can see that the Column input cell is taken as $C$2. Click OK.</p>
<p>The Data Table is filled with the calculated results for each of the input values as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/fill_data_table.jpg" alt="Fill Data Table" />
<p>If you can pay an EMI of 54,000, you can observe that the interest rate of 12.6% is suitable for you.</p>
<h2>Two-variable Data Tables</h2>
<p>A two-variable Data Table can be used if you want to see how different values of two variables in a formula will change the results of that formula. In other words, with a twovariable Data Table, you can determine how changing two inputs changes a single output. You will understand this with the help of an example.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>There is a loan of 50,000,000. You want to know how different combinations of interest rates and loan tenures will affect the monthly payment (EMI).</p>
<h2>Analysis with Two-variable Data Table</h2>
<p>Analysis with two-variable Data Table needs to be done in three steps &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Set the required background.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Create the Data Table.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Perform the Analysis.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Set the required background</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Assume that the interest rate is 12%.</p></li>
<li><p>List all the required values.</p></li>
<li><p>Name the cells containing the values, so that the formula will have names instead of cell references.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the calculation for EMI with the Excel function – <b>PMT</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your worksheet should look as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/set_background.jpg" alt="Set Background" />
<p>You can see that the cells in the column C are named as given in the corresponding cells in the column D.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Create the Data Table</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Type <b>=EMI</b> in cell F2.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/type_emi.jpg" alt="Set EMI" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Type the first list of input values, i.e. interest rates down the column F, starting with the cell below the formula, i.e. F3.</p></li>
<li><p>Type the second list of input values, i.e. number of payments across row 2, starting with the cell to the right of the formula, i.e. G2.</p>
<p>The Data Table looks as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/type_input_values.jpg" alt="Type Input Values" />
<h3>Do the analysis with the What-If Analysis Tool Data Table</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the range of cells that contains the formula and the two sets of values that you want to substitute, i.e. select the range – F2:L13.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the DATA tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click What-if Analysis in the Data Tools group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Data Table from the dropdown list.</p></li>

<li>Again, click the icon in the Row input cell box.</li>
<li>Next, click the icon in the Column input cell box.</li>
<li>Click the cell Interest_Rate, which is C2.</li>
<li>Again, click the icon in the Column input cell box.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/column_input_cell_box.jpg" alt="Column Input Cell Box" />
<p>You will see that the Row input cell is taken as &dollar;C&dollar;3 and the Column input cell is taken as &dollar;C&dollar;2. Click OK.</p>
<p>The Data Table gets filled with the calculated results for each combination of the two input values &minus;</p>
<img src="images/rename_input_cell_boxes.jpg" alt="Rename Input Cell Boxes" />
<p>If you can pay an EMI of 54,000, the interest rate of 12.2% and 288 EMIs are suitable for you. This means the tenure of the loan would be 24 years.</p>
<h3>Data Table Calculations</h3>
<p>Data Tables are recalculated each time the worksheet containing them is recalculated, even if they have not changed. To speed up the calculations in a worksheet that contains a Data Table, you need to change the calculation options to <b>Automatically Recalculate</b> the worksheet but not the Data Tables, as given in the next section.</p>
<h2>Speeding up the Calculations in a Worksheet</h2>
<p>You can speed up the calculations in a worksheet containing Data Tables in two ways &minus;</p>

<h1>What-If Analysis with Scenario Manager</h1>
<p>Scenario Manager is useful in the cases where you have more than two variables in sensitivity analysis. Scenario Manager creates scenarios for each set of the input values for the variables under consideration. Scenarios help you to explore a set of possible outcomes, supporting the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Varying as many as 32 input sets.</li>
<li>Merging the scenarios from several different worksheets or workbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to analyze more than 32 input sets, and the values represent only one or two variables, you can use Data Tables. Although it is limited to only one or two variables, a Data Table can include as many different input values as you want. Refer to <a href="what_if_analysis_with_data_tables.html">What-If Analysis with Data Tables</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>A scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically on your worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values as scenarios on a worksheet and then switch between these scenarios to view the different results.</p>
<p>For example, you can have several different budget scenarios that compare various possible income levels and expenses. You can also have different loan scenarios from different sources that compare various possible interest rates and loan tenures.</p>
<p>If the information that you want to use in scenarios is from different sources, you can collect the information in separate workbooks, and then merge the scenarios from the different workbooks into one.</p>
<p>After you have all the scenarios you need, you can create a scenario summary report &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>That incorporates information from all the scenarios.</li>
<li>That lets you compare the scenarios side-by-side.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scenario Manager</h2>
<p>Scenario Manager is one of the What-if Analysis tools in Excel.</p>
<p>To create an analysis report with Scenario Manager, you have to follow these steps &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Define the set of initial values and identify the input cells that you want to vary, called the changing cells.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Create each scenario, name the scenario and enter the value for each changing input cell for that scenario.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select the output cells, called the result cells that you want to track. These cells contain formulas in the initial set of values. The formulas use the changing input cells.</p>
<p>The Scenario Manager creates a report containing the input and the output values for each scenario.</p>
<h2>Initial Values for Scenarios</h2>
<p>Before you create several different scenarios, you need to define a set of initial values on which the scenarios will be based.</p>
<p>The steps for setting up the initial values for Scenarios are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Define the cells that contain the input values.</li>
<li>Name the input cells appropriately.</li>
<li>Identify the input cells with constant values.</li>
<li>Specify the values for the constant inputs.</li>
<li>Identify the input cells with changing values.</li>
<li>Specify the initial values for the changing inputs.</li>

<h1>What-If Analysis with Goal Seek</h1>
<p>Goal Seek is a What-If Analysis tool that helps you to find the input value that results in a target value that you want. <b>Goal Seek</b> requires a formula that uses the input value to give result in the target value. Then, by varying the input value in the formula, Goal Seek tries to arrive at a solution for the input value.</p>
<p>Goal Seek works only with one variable input value. If you have more than one input value to be determined, you have to use the Solver add-in. Refer to the chapter – <a href="advanced_data_analysis_optimization_with_excel_solver.html">Optimization with Excel Solver</a> in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Analysis with Goal Seek</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to take a loan of 5,000,000 and you want to repay in 25 years. You can pay an EMI of 50000. You want to know at what interest rate you can borrow the loan.</p>
<p>You can use <b>Goal Seek</b> to find the interest rate at which you can borrow the loan as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Set up the Excel cells for Goal Seek as given below.</p>
<img src="images/goal_seek.jpg" alt="Goal Seek" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Enter the values in column C corresponding to column D. The cell Interest_Rate is kept empty, as you have to retrieve that value. Further, though you know the EMI that you can pay (50000), that value is not included as you have to use the Excel PMT function to arrive at it. Goal Seek requires a formula to find the result. The PMT function is placed in the cell EMI so that it can be used by Goal Seek.</p>
<p>Excel computes the EMI with the PMT function. The table now looks like &minus;</p>
<img src="images/computes_emi.jpg" alt="Computes EMI" />
<p>As the <b>Interest_Rate</b> cell is empty, Excel takes that value as 0 and calculates the EMI. You can ignore the result <b>-13,888.89</b>.</p>
<p>Perform the Analysis with Goal Seek as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to <b>DATA</b> &gt; <b>What If Analysis</b> &gt; <b>Goal Seek</b> on the Ribbon.</p>
<img src="images/goal_seek_on_ribbon.jpg" alt="Goal Seek on Ribbon" />
<p>The Goal Seek dialog box appears.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Type EMI in the <b>Set cell</b> box. This box is the reference for the cell that contains the formula that you want to resolve, in this case the PMT function. It is the cell C6, which you named as EMI.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Type -50000 in the <b>To value</b> box. Here, you get the formula result, in this case, the EMI that you want to pay. The number is negative because it represents a payment.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Type Interest_Rate in the <b>By changing cell</b> box. This box has the reference of the cell that contains the value you want to adjust, in this case the interest rate. It is cell C2, which you named as Interest_Rate.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; This cell that Goal Seek changes, must be referenced by the formula in the cell that you specified in the Set cell box. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/set_cell_box.jpg" alt="Set Cell Box" />
<p>Goal Seek produces a result, as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/goal_seek_result.jpg" alt="Goal Seek Result" />
<p>As you can observe, Goal Seek found the solution using cell C6 (containing the formula) as 12% that is displayed in the cell C2, which is the interest rate. Click OK.</p>
<h2>Solving Story Problems</h2>
<p>You can solve story problems easily with Goal Seek. Let us understand this with the help of an example.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose there is a bookstore that has 100 books in storage. The original price of the book is 250 and certain number of books was sold at that price. Later, the bookstore announced a 10% discount on that book and cleared off the stock. You might want to know how many books are sold at the original price to obtain a total revenue of 24,500.</p>
<p>You can use Goal Seek to find the solution. Follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Set the worksheet as given below.</p>
<img src="images/solving_story_problems.jpg" alt="Solving Story Problems" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Go to <b>DATA &gt; What If Analysis &gt; Goal Seek</b> on the Ribbon.</p>
<p>The Goal Seek dialog box appears.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Type <b>Revenue, 24500 and Books_OriginalPrice</b> in the Set cell box, To Value box and By changing cell box respectively. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/type_revenue.jpg" alt="Type Revenue" />
<p>Goal Seek displays the status and solution.</p>
<img src="images/status_and_solution.jpg" alt="Status and Solution" />
<p>If 80 books were sold at the original price, the revenue would be 24500.</p>
<h2>Performing a Break-even Analysis</h2>
<p>In economy, break-even point is the point at which there is neither profit nor loss. This would mean &minus;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Revenue = Expenses, or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Revenue – Expenses = 0</p>
<p>You can do <b>break-even analysis with Goal Seek</b> in Excel.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose there is a store that sells toys. You might want to make a break-even analysis of the store. Collect the following information from the store &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Fixed cost of the store.</li>
<li>Unit cost of the toy.</li>
<li>Number of toys to be sold.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to find at which price they should sell the toys to break even.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Set the worksheet as given below.</p>
<img src="images/set_worksheet.jpg" alt="Set Worksheet" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Go to <b>DATA &gt; What If Analysis &gt; Goal Seek</b> on the Ribbon. The Goal Seek dialog box appears.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Type <b>Break_even_Point, 0, and Unit_Price</b> in the Set cell box, To value box and By changing cell box respectively. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/value_and_cell_box.jpg" alt="Value and Cell Box" />
<p>As you can observe, Goal Seek gave the result that if the Unit Price is 35, the store will break even.</p>
<img src="images/break_store.jpg" alt="Break Store" />
<h1>Optimization with Excel Solver</h1>
<p><b>Solver</b> is a Microsoft Excel add-in program you can use for optimization in what-if analysis.</p>
<p>According to O'Brien and Marakas, <b>optimization analysis</b> is a more complex extension of goal-seeking analysis. Instead of setting a specific target value for a variable, the goal is to find the optimum value for one or more target variables, under certain constraints. Then, one or more other variables are changed repeatedly, subject to the specified constraints, until you discover the best values for the target variables.</p>
<p>In Excel, you can use <b>Solver</b> to find an <b>optimal value</b> (maximum or minimum, or a certain value) for a formula in one cell called the objective cell, subject to certain constraints or limits, on the values of other formula cells on the worksheet.</p>
<p>This means that the Solver works with a group of cells called decision variables that are used in computing the formulas in the objective and constraint cells. Solver adjusts the values in the decision variable cells to satisfy the limits on constraint cells and produce the result you want for the objective cell.</p>
<p>You can use Solver to find optimal solutions for diverse problems such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Determining the monthly product mix for a drug manufacturing unit that maximizes the profitability.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduling workforce in an organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Solving transportation problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial planning and budgeting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Activating Solver Add-in</h2>
<p>Before you proceed with finding solution for a problem with Solver, ensure that the <b>Solver Add-in</b> is activated in Excel as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the DATA tab on the Ribbon. The <b>Solver</b> command should appear in the Analysis group as shown below.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/activating_solver_addin.jpg" alt="Activating Solver Add-in" />
<p>In case you do not find the Solver command, activate it as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the FILE tab.</li>
<li>Click Options in the left pane. Excel Options dialog box appears.</li>
<li>Click Add-Ins in the left pane.</li>
<li>Select Excel Add-Ins in the Manage box and click Go.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_excel_addins.jpg" alt="Select Excel Add-Ins" />

<img src="images/solver_addin.jpg" alt="Solver Add-in" />
<h2>Solving Methods used by Solver</h2>
<p>You can choose one of the following three solving methods that Excel Solver supports, based on the type of problem &minus;</p>
<h3>LP Simplex</h3>
<p>Used for linear problems. A <b>Solver</b> model is linear under the following conditions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The target cell is computed by adding together the terms of the (changing cell)&ast;(constant) form.</p></li>
<li><p>Each constraint satisfies the linear model requirement. This means that each constraint is evaluated by adding together the terms of the (changing cell)&ast;(constant) form and comparing the sums to a constant.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) Nonlinear</h3>
<p>Used for smooth nonlinear problems. If your target cell, any of your constraints, or both contain references to changing cells that are not of the (changing cell)&ast;(constant) form, you have a nonlinear model.</p>
<h3>Evolutionary</h3>
<p>Used for smooth nonlinear problems. If your target cell, any of your constraints, or both contain references to changing cells that are not of the (changing cell)&ast;(constant) form, you have a nonlinear model.</p>
<h3>Understanding Solver Evaluation</h3>
<p>The Solver requires the following parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Decision Variable Cells</li>
<li>Constraint Cells</li>
<li>Objective Cells</li>
<li>Solving Method</li>
</ul>
<p>Solver evaluation is based on the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The values in the decision variable cells are restricted by the values in the constraint cells.</p></li>
<li><p>The calculation of the value in the objective cell includes the values in the decision variable cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Solver uses the chosen Solving Method to result in the optimal value in the objective cell.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Defining a Problem</h3>
<p>Suppose you are analyzing the profits made by a company that manufactures and sells a certain product. You are asked to find the amount that can be spent on advertising in the next two quarters subject to a maximum of 20,000. The level of advertising in each quarter affects the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The number of units sold, indirectly determining the amount of sales revenue.</li>
<li>The associated expenses, and</li>
<li>The profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can proceed to define the problem as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Find Unit Cost.</li>
<li>Find the advertising cost per Unit.</li>
<li>Find Unit Price.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/defining_problem.jpg" alt="Defining Problem" />
<p>Next, set the cells for the required calculations as given below.</p>
<img src="images/set_cells.jpg" alt="Set Cells" />
<p>As you can observe, the calculations are done for Quarter1 and Quarter2 that are in consideration are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>No. of units available for sale in Quarter1 is 400 and in Quarter2 is 600 (cells – C7 and D7).</p></li>
<li><p>The initial values for advertising budget are set as 10000 per Quarter (Cells – C8 and D8).</p></li>
<li><p>No. of units sold is dependent on the advertising cost per unit and hence is budget for the quarter / Adv. Cost per unit. Note that we have used the Min function to take care to see that the no. of units sold in &lt;= no. of units available. (Cells – C9 and D9).</p></li>
<li><p>Revenue is calculated as Unit Price &ast; No. of Units sold (Cells – C10 and D10).</p></li>
<li><p>Expenses is calculated as Unit Cost &ast; No. of Units Available &plus; Adv. Cost for that quarter (Cells – C11 and D12).</p></li>
<li><p>Profit is Revenue – Expenses (Cells C12 and D12).</p></li>
<li><p>Total Profit is Profit in Quarter1 &plus; Profit in Quarter2 (Cell – D3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you can set the parameters for Solver as given below &minus;</p>
<img src="images/set_parameters.jpg" alt="Set Parameters" />
<p>As you can observe, the parameters for Solver are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Objective cell is D3 that contains Total Profit, which you want to maximize.</p></li>
<li><p>Decision Variable cells are C8 and D8 that contain the budgets for the two quarters – Quarter1 and Quarter2.</p></li>
<li><p>There are three Constraint cells - C14, C15 and C16.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Cell C14 that contains total budget is to set the constraint of 20000 (cell D14).</p></li>
<li><p>Cell C15 that contains the no. of units sold in Quarter1 is to set the constraint of &lt;= no. of units available in Quarter1 (cell D15).</p></li>
<li><p>Cell C16 that contains the no. of units sold in Quarter2 is to set the constraint of &lt;= no. of units available in Quarter2 (cell D16).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Exploring Data with PivotTables</h1>
<p>You can do extensive data analysis using PivotTables and produce desired reports. The integration of Data Model with PivotTable enhances the way the data is collated, connected, summarized and reported. You can import tables from external data sources and create a PivotTable with the imported tables. This facilitates automatic updations of the values in the PivotTable whenever the data in the connected data sources is updated.</p>
<h2>Creating a PivotTable to analyze External Data</h2>
<p>To create a PivotTable to analyze external data &minus;</p>

<p>As you observe, the checkbox Add this data to the Data Model is selected and disabled, indicating that the tables will be added to the Data Model automatically.</p>
<p>The data will be imported and an empty PivotTable will be created. The imported tables appear in the PivotTable Fields list.</p>
<img src="images/pivottable_fields.jpg" alt="PivotTable Fields" />
<h2>Exploring Data in Multiple Tables</h2>
<p>You can analyze the data from the imported multiple tables with PivotTable and arrive at the specific report you want in just few steps. This is possible because of the pre-existing relationships among the tables in the source database. As you imported all the tables from the database together at the same time, Excel recreates the relationships in its Data Model.</p>
<p>In the PivotTable Fields list, you will find all the tables that you imported and the fields in each of them. If the fields are not visible for any table,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the arrow next to that table in the PivotTable Fields list.</li>
<li>The fields in that table will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exploring Data using PivotTable</h2>
<p>You know how to add fields to PivotTable and drag fields across areas. Even if you are not sure of the final report that you want, you can play with the data and choose the appropriate report.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to have a report displaying the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data for five disciplines - Archery, Diving, Fencing, Figure Skating and Speed Skating.</li>
<li>Regions that scored more than 80 medals in these 5 disciplines.</li>
<li>The count of medals in each of the five disciplines in each of these regions.</li>
<li>Total count of medals for the five disciplines in each of these regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see how easily you can create this report in few steps.</p>
<p>To start with, create a PivotTable displaying the count of medals in all the regions for the selected five disciplines as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Drag the NOC_CountryRegion field from the Medals table to the COLUMNS area.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag Discipline from the Disciplines table to the ROWS area.</p></li>
<li><p>Filter Discipline to display only the five disciplines for which you wanted the report. This can be done either in the PivotTable Fields area, or from the Row Labels filter in the PivotTable itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag Medal from the Medals table to the VALUES area.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag Medal from the Medals table to the FILTERS area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the following PivotTable &minus;</p>
<img src="images/drag_medal.jpg" alt="Drag Medal" />
<p>As you observe, Count of Medals is displayed for all the regions and for the five disciplines that you selected. Next, you have to fine-tune this report so that only those regions with total count of medals greater than 80 will be displayed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the arrow button to the right of Column Labels.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Value Filters in the drop-down list that appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Greater Than…</b> from the drop-down list that appears.</p></li>

<img src="images/power_view_sheet.jpg" alt="Power View Sheet" />
<h2>Power View with Calculated Fields</h2>
<p>In the Data Model of your workbook, you have the following data tables &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Disciplines</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Medals</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose you want to display the number of medals that each country has won.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select the fields NOC_CountryRegion and Medal in the table Medals.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two fields appear under FIELDS in the Areas. Power View will be displayed as a table with the two selected fields as columns.</p>
<img src="images/fields.jpg" alt="FIELDS" />
<p>The Power View is displaying what medals each country has won. To display the number of medals won by each country, the medals need to be counted. To get the medal count field, you need to do a calculation in the Data Model.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click PowerPivot tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Manage in the Data Model group. The tables in the Data Model will be displayed.</p></li>

<li><p>Click apply filter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below the field name – Medal Count, is greater than or equal to 1000 appears. Power View will display only those records with Medal Count &gt;= 1000.</p>
<img src="images/medal_count_greater_than_thousand.jpg" alt="Medal Count Greater Than Thousand" />
<h2>Power View Visualizations</h2>
<p>In the Power View sheet, two tabs – POWER VIEW and DESIGN appear on the Ribbon.</p>
<p>Click the <b>DESIGN</b> tab.You will find several visualization commands in the Switch Visualization group on the Ribbon.</p>
<img src="images/power_view_visualizations.jpg" alt="Power View Visualizations" />
<p>You can quickly create a number of different data visualizations that suit your data using Power View. The visualizations possible are Table, Matrix, Card, Map, Chart types such as Bar, Column, Scatter, Line, Pie and Bubble Charts, and sets of multiple charts (charts with same axis).</p>
<p>To explore the data using these visualizations, you can start on the Power View sheet by creating a table, which is the default visualization and then easily convert it to other visualizations, to find the one that best illustrates your Data. You can convert one Power View visualization to another, by selecting a visualization from the Switch Visualization group on the Ribbon.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have multiple visualizations on the same Power View sheet, so that you can highlight the significant fields.</p>
<p>In the sections below, you will understand how you can explore data in two visualizations – Matrix and Card. You will get to know about exploring data with other Power View visualizations in later chapters.</p>
<h2>Exploring Data with Matrix Visualization</h2>
<p>Matrix Visualization is similar to a Table Visualization in that it also contains rows and columns of data. However, a matrix has additional features &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>It can be collapsed and expanded by rows and/or columns.</li>
<li>If it contains a hierarchy, you can drill down/drill up.</li>
<li>It can display totals and subtotals by columns and/or rows.</li>
<li>It can display the data without repeating values.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see these the differences in the views by having a Table Visualization and a Matrix Visualization of the same data side by side in the Power View.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Choose the fields – Sport, Discipline and Event. A Table representing these fields appears in Power View.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_data_with_matrix_visualization.jpg" alt="Exploring Data with Matrix Visualization" />
<p>As you observe, there are multiple disciplines for every sport and multiple events for every discipline. Now, create another Power View visualization on the right side of this Table visualization as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Power View sheet in the space to the right of the Table.</li>
<li>Choose the fields – Sport, Discipline and Event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another Table representing these fields appears in Power View, to the right of the earlier Table.</p>
<img src="images/choose_fields.jpg" alt="Choose Fields" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the right Table.</li>
<li>Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Table in the Switch Visualization group.</li>
<li>Select Matrix from the drop-down list.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/table_represents_fields.jpg" alt="Table Represents Fields" />
<p>The Table on the right in Power View gets converted to Matrix.</p>
<img src="images/power_view_converted_to_matrix.jpg" alt="Power View Converted to Matrix" />
<p>The table on the left lists the sport and discipline for each and every event, whereas the matrix on the right lists each sport and discipline only once. So, in this case, Matrix visualization gives you a comprehensive, compact and readable format for your data.</p>
<p>Now, you can explore the data to find the countries that scored more than 300 medals. You can also find the corresponding sports and have subtotals.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the fields NOC_CountryRegion, Sport and Medal Count in both the Table and Matrix Visualizations.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Filters, select the filter for the Table and set the filtering criteria as is greater than or equal to 300.</p></li>
<li><p>Click apply filter.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the same filter to Matrix also. Click apply filter.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_fields.jpg" alt="Select Fields" />
<p>Once again, you can observe that in the Matrix view, the results are legible.</p>
<h2>Exploring Data with Card Visualization</h2>
<p>In a card visualization, you will have a series of snapshots that display the data from each row in the table, laid out like an index card.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Matrix Visualization that is on the right side in the Power view.</li>
<li>Click Table in the Switch Visualization group.</li>
<li>Select Card from the drop-down list.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_card.jpg" alt="Select Card" />
<p>The Matrix Visualization gets converted to Card Visualization.</p>
<img src="images/matrix_to_card_visualization.jpg" alt="Matrix to Card Visualization" />
<p>You can use the Card view for presenting the highlighted data in a comprehensive way.</p>
<h2>Data Model and Power View</h2>
<p>A workbook can contain the following combinations of Data Model and Power View.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An internal Data Model in your workbook that you can modify in Excel, in PowerPivot, and even in a Power View sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one internal Data Model in your workbook, on which you can base a Power View sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple Power View sheets in your workbook, with each sheet based on a different Data Model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have multiple Power View sheets in your workbook, you can copy visualizations from one to another only if both the sheets are based on the same Data Model.</p>
<h2>Creating Data Model from Power View Sheet</h2>
<p>You can create and/or modify the Data Model in your workbook from the Power View sheet as follows &minus;</p>
<p>Start with a new workbook that contains Salesperson data and Sales data in two worksheets.</p>
<img src="images/salesperson_and_sales_data.jpg" alt="Salesperson and Sales Data" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a table from the range of data in the Salesperson worksheet and name it Salesperson.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a table from the range of data in the Sales worksheet and name it Sales.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You have two tables – Salesperson and Sales in your workbook.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Sales table in the Sales worksheet.</li>
<li>Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Power View in the Reports group.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/click_power_view.jpg" alt="Click Power View" />
<p>Power View Sheet will be created in your workbook. </p>
<p>You can observe that in the Power View Fields list, both the tables that are in the workbook are displayed. However, in the Power View, only the active table (Sales) fields are displayed since only the active data table fields are selected in the Fields list.</p>
<img src="images/power_view_fields_list.jpg" alt="Power View Fields List" />
<p>You can observe that in the Power View, Salesperson ID is displayed. Suppose you want to display the Salesperson name instead.</p>
<p>In the Power View Fields list, make the following changes.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Deselect the field Salesperson ID in the Salesperson table.</li>
<li>Select the field Salesperson in the Salesperson table.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you do not have a Data Model in the workbook, no relationship exists between the two tables. No data is displayed in Power View. Excel displays messages directing you what to do.</p>
<img src="images/excel_displays_messages.jpg" alt="Excel Displays Messages" />
<p>A CREATE button also will be displayed. Click the CREATE button.</p>
<p>The <b>Create Relationship</b> dialog box opens in the Power View Sheet itself.</p>
<img src="images/create_relationship.jpg" alt="Create Relationship" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Create a relationship between the two tables using the Salesperson ID field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without leaving the Power View sheet, you have successfully created the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The internal Data Model with the two tables, and</li>
<li>The relationship between the two tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>The field Salesperson appears in Power View along with the Sales data.</p>
<img src="images/sales_data.jpg" alt="Sales Data" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Retain the fields Region, Salesperson and &sum; Order Amount in that order in the area FIELDS.<p></li>
<li><p>Convert the Power View to Matrix Visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the field Month to the area TILE BY. Matrix Visualization appears as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/appears_matrix_visualization.jpg" alt="Appears Matrix Visualization" />
<p>As you observe, for each of the regions, the Salespersons of that region and sum of Order Amount are displayed. Subtotals are displayed for each region. The display is month wise as selected in the tile above the view. As you select the month in the tile, the data of that month will be displayed.</p>
<h1>Exploring Data with Power View Charts</h1>
<p>In Power View, you have a number of Chart options: Pie, Column, Bar, Line, Scatter, and Bubble. The Charts in Power View are interactive. If you click on a value in one chart &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>That value in that chart is highlighted.</li>
<li>That value in all the other charts in Power View is also highlighted.</li>
<li>All the tables, matrices and tiles in Power View are filtered to that value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, Power View Charts serve as interactive, pictorial data analysis tools. Further, the charts are interactive in a presentation setting also, which would enable you to highlight the analysis results.</p>
<h2>Exploring with Line Charts</h2>
<p>You can use Line charts for comparing data points in one or more data series. Line charts distribute category data evenly along a horizontal (category) axis, and all numerical value data along a vertical (value) axis.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to display the Medal Count for each country.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a Power View with the fields NOC_CountryRegion and Medal Count selected. By default, Table will be displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Table.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Other Chart in the Switch Visualization group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Line from the drop-down list. Line Chart will be displayed in the Power View.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Line or the Category (x-axis) axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag to left or right. The Categories to the left or right will be displayed and Line chart will be displayed accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the cursor on any of the data points on the line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The values corresponding to that data point will be displayed at that point.</p>
<img src="images/data_point.jpg" alt="Data Point" />
<h2>Exploring with Bar Charts</h2>
<p>You can use Bar charts for comparing data points in one or more data series. In a Bar chart, categories are organized along the vertical axis and values along the horizontal axis. In Power View, there are three Bar chart subtypes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Stacked Bar.</li>
<li>100% Stacked Bar.</li>
<li>Clustered Bar.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Bar with Category GER. Only that Bar will be highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>With Ctrl key pressed, click the Bars with Categories FRA and ITA. The Bars for GER, FRA and ITA will be highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>The Table on the left also shows values for these three Categories only.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/ger_category.jpg" alt="GER Category" />
<p>In both the visualizations, click the Gender field also in the Power View Fields list.</p>
<img src="images/power_view_fields.jpg" alt="Power View Fields" />
<p>Click the left portion of the Bar – GER. It is highlighted. In the Table, only the information for GER and Men will be displayed.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You cannot make multiple selections in this case.</p>
<img src="images/fra.jpg" alt="FRA" />
<h2>Exploring with Column Charts</h2>
<p>You can use Column charts for showing data changes over a period of time or for illustrating comparison among items. In Column charts, categories are along the horizontal axis and values along the vertical axis.</p>
<p>In Power View, there are three Column chart subtypes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Stacked Column.</li>
<li>100% Stacked Column.</li>
<li>Clustered Column.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can convert a Table Visualization to Column Chart Visualization as follows &minus;</p>

<li>Create another Table visualization below the Stacked Column chart.</li>
<li>Click the new Table.</li>
<li>Click Other Chart in the Switch Visualization group.</li>
<li>Select Pie.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_with_simple_pie_charts.jpg" alt="Exploring with Simple Pie Charts" />
<p>The Table Visualization below the Stacked Column chart is converted to Pie Chart Visualization. As you observe, there are too many slices in the Pie chart as there are many categories (countries). Note that Pie charts work well only when the number of categories is 8 or less.</p>
<img src="images/pie_chart_visualization.jpg" alt="Pie Chart Visualization" />
<p>You can reduce the number of categories by filtering the values as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Set the filtering as Medal Count is greater than or equal to 1300 in &minus;
<ul class="list">
<li>Table Visualization</li>
<li>Column Chart Visualization</li>
<li>Pie Chart Visualization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You have to define and apply filtering to each of the visualizations separately.</p>
<img src="images/visualizations.jpg" alt="Visualizations" />
<p>Now, you have a Simple Pie Chart Visualization, wherein the count of Medals are shown by the Pie size, and countries by colors.</p>
<p>Click on a Pie slice. That slice is highlighted and others get grayed. The corresponding column in the Column chart also is highlighted. In the table, only the values corresponding to the highlighted Pie slice will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/click_pie_slice.jpg" alt="Click Pie Slice" />
<h2>Exploring with Sophisticated Pie Charts</h2>
<p>You can make your Pie Chart Visualization sophisticated, by adding more features. You can make a pie char that &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drills down when you double-click a slice, or</li>
<li>Shows sub-slices within the larger color slices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Pie chart that drills down when you double-click a slice</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In the Pie chart, in the Power View Fields list, drag the field Gender to COLOR area, to below the field NOC_CountryRegion. This means you have two categories.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Table, include Gender also in the Fields list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your Power View looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/exploring_with_sophisticated_pie_charts.jpg" alt="Exploring with Sophisticated Pie Charts" />
<p>As you observe, there is a single slice with one color for each category - country.</p>
<p>On the Pie chart, double-click on the USA slice.</p>
<p>The Pie chart in your Power View will be changed to show values by Gender, which is the second category, for the selected category (USA). The colors of the pie chart now show the percentages of the second field, i.e., Gender, filtered for the pie color you doubleclicked. In other words, the Pie chart was drilled down. As you observe, a small arrow appears on the top right corner of the Pie chart. If you place the mouse over it, the arrow is highlighted and Drill up will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/click_usa_slice.jpg" alt="Click USA Slice" />
<p>Click the drill up arrow. The Pie Chart returns to its previous state.</p>
<h3>A Pie chart that shows sub-slices within the larger color slices</h3>
<p>In the Pie chart, in the Power View Fields list, drag the field Gender from COLOR area to SLICES area.</p>
<p>Your Power View looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/power_view_result.jpg" alt="Power View Result" />
<p>As you can see, in the Pie chart, there are two slices of same color for the category USA.</p>
<p>Click on one of these slices.</p>
<p>You will be able to see the following changes in Power View &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The selected slice is highlighted and other slices are grayed or deactivated.</li>

<li>The Table shows the values for the selected slice.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/highlighted_selected_slice.jpg" alt="Highlighted Selected Slice" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the other slice. You can observe the changes as given above for this selected slice.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/click_slice.jpg" alt="Click Slice" />
<h2>Exploring with Scatter Charts</h2>
<p>You can use Scatter charts to display many related data in one chart. In Scatter charts, the x-axis displays one numeric field and the y-axis displays another, making it easy to see the relationship between the two values for all the items in the chart.</p>
<p>To create a Scatter Chart Visualization, proceed as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Add the fields Sport, Medal Count and Event to Table.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the arrow next to Event in the Power View Fields list. Click Count (Distinct). The field Event changes to the numeric field Count of Event. Therefore, you have one category field – Sport and two numeric fields – Medal Count and Count of Event.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Other Chart</b> in the Switch Visualization group.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Scatter</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_with_scatter_charts.jpg" alt="Exploring with Scatter Charts" />
<p>You will get the Scatter Chart Visualization, with the data points displayed as circles of same size, showing how the Count of Event and Medal Count values are related for each sport.</p>
<img src="images/scatter_chart_visualization.jpg" alt="Scatter Chart Visualization" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the LAYOUT tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Data Labels in the Labels group.</li>

</ul>
<img src="images/data_labels.jpg" alt="Data Labels" />
<p>The sport Wrestling has less number of medals in more number of events as compared to the sport Aquatics that has more number of medals in less number of events.</p>
<h2>Exploring with Bubble Charts</h2>
<p>You can use Bubble charts to display many related data in one chart. In Bubble Charts, the x-axis displays one numeric field and the y-axis displays another, making it easy to see the relationship between the two values for all the items in the chart. A third numeric field controls the size of the data points.</p>
<p>To create a Bubble Chart Visualization, proceed as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag Medal Count to Size.</li>
<li>Drag NOC_CountryRegion to &sum; X-VALUE. The Scatter chart is converted to Bubble chart.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_with_bubble_charts.jpg" alt="Exploring with Bubble Charts" />
<p>As you observe, the size of each bubble shows the medal count. The data labels show the Sport.</p>
<h2>Exploring with Colors</h2>
<p>You can also color the bubbles by a category as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag the field NOC_CountryRegion to COLOR area in the Power View Fields list.</li>
<li>Drag the field  DiscipleEvent to &sum; X-VALUES.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_with_colors.jpg" alt="Exploring with Colors" />
<p>As you observe, Legend shows the values of the category that is in COLOR area and the respective colors. The data labels correspond to the category in DETAILS area. The size of the data points is by the area &sum; SIZE.</p>
<p>Next, you can see how selecting a category in Legend changes the visualization &minus;</p>
<p>Click on a value in the Legend. Only the data points of that color (i.e., corresponding to that value) will be highlighted. All the other data points will be deactivated.</p>
<img src="images/deactivate_data_points.jpg" alt="Deactivate Data Points" />
<p>As you observe, all the sports corresponding to the selected country are displayed and the size of each bubble represents the medal count.</p>
<p>If you want to know the details of a single data point &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Highlight the data point by just clicking on that bubble.</li>
<li>Place the cursor on that data point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only that bubble is highlighted and the rest of the bubbles get grayed. All the information about that data point will be displayed in a box next to the data point.</p>
<img src="images/bubble_highlighted.jpg" alt="Bubble Highlighted" />
<h2>Exploring with Play Axis</h2>
<p>You can visualize the data changes over a period of time using Play Axis as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag the field Edition in the Power View Fields list to PLAY AXIS area.</li>
</ul>
<p>A timeline with a Play button is inserted in your Bubble chart visualization. You can adjust the timeline by filtering the Edition field values in the Filters. This would be useful if you want to focus on a particular time range or if the timeline is too wide.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Adjust the timeline by filtering Edition field in Filters and choosing a span of time values.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_with_play_axis.jpg" alt="Exploring with Play Axis" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Play button. The bubbles travel, grows and shrink to show how the values change based on the play axis. A small vertical line appears on the timeline that moves across the timeline. The time at that point also is displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/click_play_button.jpg" alt="Click Play Button" />
<p>You can pause at any point to study the data in more detail.</p>
<h1>Exploring Data with Power View Maps</h1>
<p>You can use maps to display your data in the context of geography. Maps in Power View use Bing map tiles, so you can zoom and pan as you would with any other Bing map. To make maps work, Power View has to send the data to Bing through a secured web connection for geocoding. So, it asks you to enable content. Adding locations and values places dots on the map. The larger the value, the bigger the dot. When you add a multivalue series, you get pie charts on the map, with the size of the pie chart showing the size of the total.</p>
<h2>Exploring Data with Geographic Fields</h2>
<p>You can create a Power View Map Visualization if your data has a geographic field such as Country/Region, State/Province, or City.</p>
<p>To create a map visualization for the medal count, country wise proceed as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a new Power View sheet from INSERT tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the fields NOC_CountryRegion and Medal Count in the Power View Fields list to the Power View. A Table with these two fields are created.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/exploring_data_with_geographic_fields.jpg" alt="Exploring Data with Geographic Fields" />
<p>So, you have a geographic field and a numeric field.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Map in the Switch Visualization group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Table Visualization converts into Map Visualization.</p>
<img src="images/map_visualization.jpg" alt="Map Visualization" />
<p>As you observe, Power View creates a map with a dot representing each geographic location. The size of the dot is the value of the corresponding numeric field, which is the medal count in this case. Further, in the Power View Fields list, the Geographic field will be in the Locations area and the Numeric field will be in the &sum; SIZE area.</p>
<p>To display more information about a data point, you can do one of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you place the cursor on a dot on the map, a box appears displaying the geographic location name and the corresponding numeric value.</p></li>
<li><p>If you click on a dot on the map, that particular dot gets highlighted.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pie Charts as Data Points</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to add another field also to the map visualization. For example, you might want to display the details about the medals, viz. the medal types – Gold, Silver and Bronze. You can do it as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag the field Medal from the Power View Fields list to the COLOR area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dots are converted to Pie charts. A Legend for Medal appears displaying the types of medals and respective colors. i.e., each color in the Pie chart represents the type of the medal.</p>
<img src="images/medals.jpg" alt="Medals" />
<p>You can observe that the size of a Pie chart corresponds to the medal count and the size of each slice in the Pie chart corresponds to the count of that medal type.</p>
<h2>Highlighting a Data Point</h2>
<p>Now, you can filter your data and highlight a significant data point as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In the Filters area, set the Medal Count to display only the values greater than or equal to 300.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the filter. The map zooms and displays only the filtered values.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/highlighting_data_point.jpg" alt="Highlighting Data Point" />
<p>Place the cursor on the dot representing Great Britain. The dot gets highlighted and zoomed. The details of the Pie chart will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/cursor_represents_great_britain.jpg" alt="Cursor Represents Great Britain" />
<p>As you can see, the medal count for gold for Great Britain is 514. You can find the medal counts for silver and bronze by placing the cursor on those slices.</p>
<h2>Highlighting a Pie Slice in a Data Point</h2>
<p>Next, you might want to highlight the gold medal count of Great Britain.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Place the cursor on the slice with red color (as you can make out that red represents gold in the Legend). Click it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That Pie Slice will be highlighted. The other slices in that Pie chart and all the other Pie charts will be deactivated.</p>
<img src="images/highlighting_pie_slice.jpg" alt="Highlighting Pie Slice" />
<p>Place the cursor on the dot again. The dot is zoomed. The slice representing gold will be highlighted. The details of the slice will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/slice_details.jpg" alt="Slice Details" />
<h1>Exploring Data with Power View Multiples</h1>
<p>Multiples, also called Trellis Charts are a series of charts with identical X and Y axes. You can arrange Multiples side by side, to compare many different values easily at the same time.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>You can have Line charts, Pie charts, Bar charts and Column charts as Multiples.</li>
<li>You can arrange the Multiples horizontally or vertically.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Line Charts as Multiples</h2>
<p>You might want to display the medal count by year for each Region. Firstly, you need to have the field Year. To get this field, you need to have a calculated column as follows &minus;</p>

<p>A new column with header CalculatedColumn1 is created with values corresponding to the Year values in Edition column.</p>
<img src="images/calculatedcolumn1_created.jpg" alt="CalculatedColumn1 Created" />
<p>Click on the header and rename it as Year.</p>
<img src="images/rename_year.jpg" alt="Rename Year" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Close the PowerPivot window. The Data Model gets updated. The new field - ∑ Year appears in the Power View Fields list.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a Table in Power View with fields NOC_CountryRegion, Count of Year and Medal Count, by dragging the fields.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/create_table_in_power_view.jpg" alt="Create Table in Power View" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Convert Table into a Line chart in Power View.</li>
<li>Remove the field NOC_CountryRegion. A Line chart appears with Medal Count by Year.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/remove_field.jpg" alt="Remove Field" />
<p>As you can observe, Year is in AXIS area and Medal Count is in &sum; VALUES area in Power View Fields list. In the Line chart, Year values are on X-axis and Medal count on Y-axis.</p>
<p>Now, you can create Multiples visualization with Line charts, as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag the field NOC_CountryRegion to VERTICAL MULTIPLES area in the Power View Fields list.</li>
<li>Click the tab LAYOUT on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Grid Height in the Multiples group.</li>

<ul class="list">
<li>Click Grid Width in the Multiples group.</li>
<li>Click on a value from the dropdown list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the Multiples Visualization with Line charts arranged as a grid, with each Line chart representing a country (NOC_CountryRegion).</p>
<img src="images/arrange_multiple_visualization_as_grid.jpg" alt="Arrange Multiple Visualization as Grid" />
<h2>Vertical Multiples</h2>
<p>As you are aware, you have placed the NOC_CountryRegion field in the VERTICAL MULTIPLES area. Hence, the visualization that you have got is the Vertical Multiples visualization. You can observe the following in the chart given above.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>One Line chart per category that is placed in VERTICAL MULTIPLES area, in this case – the country.</p></li>
<li><p>The grid height and grid width that you have chosen determine the number of rows and number of columns for the Multiples.</p></li>
<li><p>A common x-axis for all the multiples.</p></li>
<li><p>A similar y-axis for each row of the multiples.</p></li>
<li><p>A vertical scroll bar on the right side that can be used to drag the rows of Line charts up and down, so as to make the other Line charts visible.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Horizontal Multiples</h2>
<p>You can have the Multiples Visualization with Horizontal Multiples also as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drag the field NOC_CountryRegion to VERTICAL MULTIPLES area.</li>
<li>Click the Layout tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Select the values for Grid Height and Grid Width in the Multiples group.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the Horizontal Multiples visualization as follows &minus;</p>

<p>You can observe the following in the above chart &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>One Line chart per category that is placed in HORIZONTAL MULTIPLES area, in this case – the country.</p></li>
<li><p>The grid height that you have chosen determines the height of the Line charts, unlike the number of rows of Line charts as is the case in the VERTICAL MULTIPLES. In other words, there is a single row of Line charts with the height determined by the Grid Height that is chosen.</p></li>
<li><p>The grid width that you have chosen determines the number of columns of Line charts in the row.</p></li>
<li><p>A common x-axis for all the multiples.</p></li>
<li><p>A common y-axis for all the multiples.</p></li>
<li><p>A horizontal scroll bar at the bottom, below the x-axis, that can be used to drag the row of Line charts to the left and the right, so as to make the other Line charts visible.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pie Charts as Multiples</h2>
<p>If you want to explore / visualize more than one category in Multiples, Pie charts is an option. Suppose you want to explore the medal count by medal type for each of the countries. Proceed as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Design tab.</li>
<li>Select Pie from the dropdown under Other Chart.</li>
<li>Drag Medal to the area SLICES.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the Horizontal Multiples visualization with Pie charts, as you have the field NOC_CountryRegion in the area HORIZONTAL MULTIPLES.</p>
<img src="images/pie_charts_as_multiples.jpg" alt="Pie Charts as Multiples" />
<p>As you can observe the medal-count for each country is displayed as a Pie chart with the slices representing the medal types with the color as given in the Legend.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to highlight the count of gold medals for all the countries. You can do it in a single step as follows &minus;</p>
<p>Click on the blue color slice one of the Pie charts (as blue is color for Gold as per the Legend). In all the Pie charts, only the blue slices are highlighted and other slices are grayed.</p>
<img src="images/click_blue_color_slice.jpg" alt="Click Blue Color Slice" />
<p>As you can observe, this gives a fast way of exploring and comparing the count of gold medals across the countries.</p>
<p>You might want to display more number of Pie charts in a visualization. You can do it by simply switching over to Vertical Multiples Visualization and choosing the right values for Grid Height and Grid Width for a proper display.</p>
<img src="images/gold_medals_across_country.jpg" alt="Gold Medals across Country" />
<p>Click on the blue slice on one of the Pie charts. The blue slices in all the Pie charts are highlighted so that you can compare the gold medal counts across the countries.</p>
<img src="images/highlight_blue_color_slice.jpg" alt="Highlight Blue Color Slice" />
<h2>Bar Charts as Multiples</h2>
<p>You can choose Bar charts also for Multiples visualization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Switch over to Stacked Bar visualization.</li>
<li>Adjust the Grid Height and Grid Width to get a proper display of the Bar charts.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Grid Height of 6 and Grid Width of 2, you will get the following &minus;</p>

<img src="images/column_charts_as_multiples.jpg" alt="Column Charts as Multiples" />
<p>You can have Clustered Column charts also for this visualization.</p>
<img src="images/clustered_column_charts.jpg" alt="Clustered Column Charts" />
<h3>Wrap-up</h3>
<p>The fields you choose depend on what you want to explore, analyze and present. For example, in all the visualizations above, we have chosen Medal for Slices that helped to analyze medal count by medal type. You might want to explore, analyze and present the data gender-wise. In such a case, choose the field Gender for Slices.</p>
<p>Once again, the visualization that is suitable also depends on the data you are displaying. If you are not sure about the suitability, you can just play around to choose the right one as switching across the visualizations is quick and simple in Power View. Moreover, you can also do it in the presentation view, in order to answer any queries that can arise during a presentation.</p>
<h1>Exploring Data with Power View Tiles</h1>
<p>Suppose you have lot of data to display with significant data points at varied places. In such a case, you might have to scroll very often in your Power View visualizations to find the data you are looking for. This would be tedious and also might not be smooth when you are presenting the results.</p>
<p>You can overcome this drudgery, using the tile feature in Power View. With tiles, you can gain insights from your data much more quickly. Tiles act as navigation strips, with a single tile for each possible field value. When you click on a tile, only data related to that field value is displayed. As it is easy to scroll the values in the navigation strip that dynamically changes the corresponding values in the visualization, tiles become an easy to use tool for you.</p>
<p>You can have Tiles in a Table, Matrix, Card or Chart visualization. You can have a combination of these in Power View and get them filtered with Tiles. A Tile can be simple text or an image.</p>
<h2>Table with Tiles</h2>
<p>Start with a Table Visualization as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Drag the fields NOC_CountryRegion, Sport and Medal Count to Power View. As you observe, as the number of rows is large, it is difficult to scroll up and down to highlight values.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the field Sport from FIELDS area to TILE BY area in the Power View Fields list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Navigation Strip appears at the top of the Table.</p>
<img src="images/table_with_tiles.jpg" alt="Table with Tiles" />
<p>You can observe the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>By default, the first Tile in the Navigation Strip is selected.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Table, the values are filtered to that of the Tile selected. In this case, the Sport that is selected.</p></li>
<li><p>There are arrow buttons at the left and right edges of the Navigation strip to enable scrolling.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can select a different Tile as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Scroll the Navigation Strip to display the Tile representing the Sport you are looking for, for e.g. Badminton.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Tile – Badminton. The values in the Table are filtered to those of Badminton.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_different_tile.jpg" alt="Select Different Tile" />
<p>You can observe the medal count Total is also displayed. You have an option to turn Totals on or off from the Ribbon. You also can make the Tiles more appealing and meaningful by having images in place of Text.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Include a column that has hyperlinks to the image files corresponding to each of the Sports.</p></li>
<li><p>Include that field, for e.g. Discimage in TILE BY. You will get the Tiles as images, portraying each sport.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/include_field.jpg" alt="Include Field" />
<h2>Tile Navigation Strip - Tab Strip</h2>
<p>There are two types of navigation strips in Excel - Tile Flow and Tab Strip.</p>
<p>In a Tab strip, you can observe the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Tab strip displays the navigation strip across the top of the Visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, the first Tile in the navigation strip that is the leftmost is selected.</p></li>
<li><p>There are arrow buttons at the left and right edges of the navigation strip to enable scrolling.</p></li>
<li><p>You can scroll to the left or right to display the Tiles.</p></li>
<li><p>The highlighted Tile moves to the left or right as you scroll the tab strip. It can also go out of view, while scrolling.</p></li>
<li><p>You can click on a Tile to select it. The Tile gets highlighted at the same position as it was before.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Table, the values are filtered to that of the Tile selected. In this case, the Sport that is selected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tile Navigation Strip - Tile Flow</h2>
<p>You can covert the navigation strip from tab strip to tile flow as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click a Tile on the navigation strip.</li>
<li>Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Tile Type in the Tiles group.</li>
<li>Click Tile Flow in the dropdown list.</li>

<p>The navigation strip shifts to the bottom of the Table.</p>
<img src="images/navigation_strip_shifts_to_bottom.jpg" alt="Navigation Strip Shifts to Bottom" />
<p>In a Tile Flow, you can observe the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Tile flow displays the navigation strip across the bottom of the Visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, the first Tile in the navigation strip is selected. It will be displayed at the center of the tile flow.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no arrow buttons for scrolling.</p></li>
<li><p>You can scroll to the left or right by clicking on any of the Tiles to the left or right of the center Tile.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tiles flow to the left or right and the center Tile will always get highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>You can click on a Tile to select it. The Tile gets highlighted and moves to the center of the Tile flow.</p></li>
<li><p>As the selected Tile is always the center Tile, the following happens &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Selected Tile does not go out of view.</p></li>
<li><p>When you scroll to the left or right, the Tile that comes to the center position gets automatically selected and highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>The original selection disappears.</p></li>
<li><p>The Visualization, Table in this case, automatically is updated to the Tile in the center of the Tile flow.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In the Table, the values are filtered to that of the Tile selected. In this case, the Sport that is selected.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/values_filtered.jpg" alt="Values Filtered" />
<h2>Matrix with Tiles</h2>
<p>Suppose you want the medal count by medal type – Gold, Silver and Bronze and also the total medal count, by country for a selected sport, you can display the results in a Matrix Tile visualization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Switch Visualization to Matrix.</li>
<li>Add the field Medal to Matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the desired results as follows &minus;</p>

<p>As your data contains geographic locations, you can also switch over to Map Tile Visualization &minus;</p>
<img src="images/maps_with_tiles.jpg" alt="Maps with Tiles" />
<h1>Exploring Data with Hierarchies</h1>
<p>If your data more number of levels, it would be easy for you to explore and present it with Hierarchies. For any data value in your Hierarchy, you can drill down to display more details or drill up to have a holistic view.</p>
<p>If your data model has a hierarchy, you can use it in Power View. Otherwise, you can create a hierarchy in the Power View itself with few easy steps.</p>
<h2>Creating a Hierarchy in Power View</h2>
<p>In Power View a Hierarchy is best depicted in Matrix visualization. Create a Hierarchy in Matrix visualization as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Drag the fields NOC_CountryRegion, Sport, Discipline, Year and Medal – in that order to ROWS area.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the field Medal Count to &sum; VALUES. The order of the fields in the ROWS area defines the Hierarchy in Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not sure about the order of fields, start with any order and then rearrange them in the ROWS area by dragging them up and down, while looking at the display in the Power View.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the following Matrix visualization showing the five Hierarchy levels &minus;</p>
<img src="images/creating_hierarchy_in_power_view.jpg" alt="Creating Hierarchy in Power View" />
<p>As you observe, the levels are nested.</p>
<h2>Drilling Up and Drilling Down the Hierarchy</h2>
<p>You can drill up and drill down the hierarchy such that you can show just one level at a time. You can drill down for details and drill up for summary.</p>
<p>To enable drill up and drill down, first set up show levels option as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Show Levels in the Options group.</li>
<li>Select Rows – Enable Drill Down One Level at a Time from the drop-down list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Matrix collapses to display only Level 1 data.</p>
<img src="images/drilling_down.jpg" alt="Drilling Down" />
<p>As you observe, when you click on each of the data items, a downward arrow appears on the right side for that item indicating drill down.</p>
<p>Now, you can drill down the data one level at a time as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click Level 1 data item for which you want further details. For example, click AUS. As you observe, Medal Count for AUS is 1079.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the arrow to the right side of it. Alternatively, you can double click on the data item.</p></li>
<li><p>Level 2 data pertaining to AUS will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/drilling_up_and_down.jpg" alt="Drilling Up and Down" />
<p>As you observe, an upward arrow appears on the left side of the first item, indicating drill up and when you click on each of the data items, a downward arrow appears on the right side for that item indicating drill down.</p>
<p>Now, you can drill down the data one more level as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click Level 2 data item for which you want further details. For example, click Aquatics. As you observe, the medal count for Aquatics is 354.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the arrow to the right side of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Level 3 data pertaining to Aquatics will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/display_diving.jpg" alt="Display Diving" />
<p>As you observe, an upward arrow appears on the left side of the first item, indicating drill up and when you click on each of the data items, a downward arrow appears on the right side for that item indicating drill down.</p>
<p>Now, you can drill down the data one more level as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click Level 3 data item for which you want further details. For e.g. click on Diving. As you observe, the medal count for Diving is 17.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the arrow to the right side of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Level 4 data pertaining to Diving will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/drill_up_and_down.jpg" alt="Drill Up and Down" />
<p>As you observe, an upward arrow appears on the left side of the first item, indicating drill up and when you click on each of the data items, a downward arrow appears on the right side for that item indicating drill down.</p>
<p>Now, you can drill down the data one more level as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Level 4 data item for which you want further details. For example, click on 2008. As you observe, the medal count for 2008 is 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the arrow to the right side of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Level 5 data pertaining to 2008 will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/drill_down_data.jpg" alt="Drill Down Data" />
<p>As you observe, for the first Level 5 data item an upward arrow appears on the left side indicating drill up. Drill down arrows do not appear on the right side for the data items as there are further levels to drill down.</p>
<p>Now, you can drill up the data one level at a time by clicking on the upward arrow to the left side of the first item at each Level.</p>
<h2>Exploring a Hierarchy in Stacked Bar Chart</h2>
<p>You might want to highlight certain values in a hierarchy in a significant way. In such a case, you can use a chart visualization, such as Stacked Bar chart as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Matrix visualization and switch to Stacked Bar Chart.</li>
<li>Drag the field Medal to LEGEND area.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the Stacked Bar chart visualization as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/exploring_hierarchy_in_stacked_bar.jpg" alt="Exploring Hierarchy in Stacked Bar" />
<p>In this case, you need to double-click on a Bar to drill down.</p>
<p>Double-click on Bar representing AUS. The chart is drilled down to display the next level of data in the hierarchy.</p>
<img src="images/chat_drilled_down.jpg" alt="Chat Drilled Down" />
<p>As you can observe, an upward arrow indicating drill up appears at the top-right corner of the chart.</p>
<p>Drill down one more level by double-clicking on Aquatics Bar. The chart is drilled down to display the next level of data in the hierarchy.</p>
<img src="images/aquatics_bar.jpg" alt="Aquatics Bar" />
<p>You can drill down by double-clicking on a Bar or drill up by clicking on the drill up arrow on the top-right corner of the chart.</p>
<p>This gives you an interactive exploration of data during presentation also.</p>
<h1>Aesthetic Power View Reports</h1>
<p>You have learnt how to explore data interactively using Power View in the earlier chapters of this tutorial. Each Power View sheet can in turn be used as an interactive report. To make the Power View report more appealing, you can choose any of the themes, chart palettes, fonts and background colors that Power View provides you.</p>
<p>When you change the theme, the new theme applies to all the Power View visualizations in the report. Further, you can add background images, choose background formatting, format numbers, and change the Font or the text size.</p>
<h2>Report Layout Finalization</h2>
<p>As with any other report, you need to first decide on what you are going to report and the best layout so that you can highlight the significant data points.</p>
<p>Suppose you need to report the details of the medals won by Australia in aquatics. As you are aware, the details include the disciplines in aquatics, medal count, and the medal types (Gold, Silver and Bronze).</p>
<p>You can have three views in the report for the best portrayal of the data points in this case &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Matrix that contains the data - country, sport, and medal count.</li>
<li>Card that contains the data – country, sport, discipline and medal Count.</li>
<li>Stacked Bar chart that contains the data that is drilled down to discipline, medal and medal count.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/report_layout_finalization.jpg" alt="Report Layout Finalization" />
<p>As you can observe, the data in the Matrix and Card is scrolled so that &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Matrix displays the details of Australia for all sports and aquatics got 354 medals.</p></li>
<li><p>Card displays Australia – sport aquatics, disciplines Diving, Swimming and Water polo and medal count in each of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Stacked Bar chart displays the medal count by medal type in these three disciplines.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the report layout is ready, you can start making it appealing. However, you need to keep two points in mind during this task &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The look of the report should be based on the audience (Managers / Top Management / Clients).</p></li>
<li><p>Do not get over bored with the different formatting options. Just keep it simple and highlight the data points that require attention.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, you will understand how to arrive at a sample report with the following options &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<p>Your sample report is ready.</p>
<h1>Key Performance Indicators</h1>
<p>Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are a set of quantifiable measures that an organization uses to measure its performance over time. KPIs are normally used to evaluate the success of an organization as a whole or department-wise (e.g. sales, finance, etc.).  You need to define the KPIs based on the organization objectives and monitor them from time to time to track the progress.</p>
<p>There are a number of KPI types to choose from based on your requirements. Examples include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Income and Expenses</li>
<li>Rate of Return</li>
<li>Average Purchase Value</li>
<li>Customer Lifetime Value</li>
<li>Working Capital</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that KPIs are a form of communication involving the following activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Identifying the KPIs based on the organization’s objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring and reporting the KPIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Altering the KPIs as the organization progresses and / or the organization’s goals change.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Identifying the KPIs</h2>
<p>The first and the most crucial step in KPI analysis is to identify the KPIs that effectively monitor the required trends in the organization. This requires complete understanding of the objectives and requires proper communication channels between the analysts and those who are responsible for fulfilling the objectives.</p>
<p>There are a number of KPIs to choose from, but the success in monitoring relies on the right choice of those that are relevant to the objectives. The KPIs differ from organization to organization and from department to department and will be effective only when they lead to improvement in the performance.</p>
<p>You can evaluate the relevance of a KPI using the SMART criteria – i.e. the KPI should be <b>S</b>pecific, <b>M</b>easurable, <b>A</b>ttainable, <b>R</b>elevant and <b>T</b>ime-bound. In other words, the KPI chosen should meet the following criteria &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The KPI reflects your <b>S</b>pecific objective.</p></li>
<li><p>The KPI enables you to <b>M</b>easure progress towards that goal.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal for which the KPI is being defined is realistically <b>A</b>ttainable.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal that the KPI is targeting is <b>R</b>elevant to the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>You can set a time-frame for achieving the goal so that the KPI reveals how near the goal is as compared to the time that is left.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The defined KPIs are to be evaluated from time to time to find their relevance as the time progresses. If required, different KPIs need to be defined and monitored. Only then, your KPI monitoring will be relating to the current organization needs.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis needs, you have to choose the relevant KPIs, and examples include the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sales department might use a KPI to measure monthly gross profit against projected gross profit.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting department might measure monthly expenditures against revenue to evaluate costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Human resources department might measure quarterly employee turnover.</p></li>
<li><p>Business professionals frequently use KPIs that are grouped together in a business scorecard to obtain a quick and accurate historical summary of business success or to identify trends or to identify performance improvement opportunities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The examples used in this chapter are indicative so as to help you in understanding how you can define and monitor KPIs in Excel. The sole discretion of identifying the KPIs lies with you based on the objectives so as to reflect the current scenario as compared to the targets.</p>
<h2>KPIs in Excel</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can analyze performance against the set target with PowerPivot. For e.g., a PowerPivot KPI could be used to determine for each year and salesperson how his actual sales compared to his sales target.</p></li>
<li><p>You can explore and visualize the same KPI with Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also define new KPIs and /or edit them in Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>You can produce aesthetic reports with KPIs in Power View.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Defining a KPI in Excel</h2>
<p>The first step in KPI analysis is to define the identified KPI. This requires defining the three parameters for the KPI as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Base Value</h3>
<p>A Base Value is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value. The calculated field represents the current value for the item in that row of the table. E.g., aggregate of sales, profit for a given period, etc.</p>
<h3>Target Value/ Goal</h3>
<p>A Target Value (or Goal) is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value, or by an absolute value. It is the value against which the current value is evaluated. This could be a fixed number, for example, average number of sick-leave days that is applicable to all the employees, or a calculated field, which results in a different goal for each row, for example, budget of each department in the organization.</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Status is the indicator of the value. It would be striking if you set it as visual indicator. In Power View in Excel, you can edit the KPI, choosing which indicators to use and what values to trigger each indicator.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to monitor the Sales targets of the Salespersons in an organization who are selling a product. The objective of the analysis is to identify the best performers who are meeting the target Sales Amount. You can proceed to define the KPI as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Base Value</b> &minus; Current Value of the Sales Amount for each salesperson.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Target Value / Goal</b> &minus; This is fixed for all the salespersons so as to enable comparison between the salespersons. Assume that the Target Sales Amount is 3500. Note that for a different analysis you could vary the target values for the salespersons.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Status</b> &minus; The Status is to be displayed with a graphic to easily determine the status of the Base Value compared to the Target Value.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>KPIs in PowerPivot</h2>
<p>You can define KPIs in PowerPivot as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Start with two tables SalesPerson and Sales.
<ul class="list">
<li>SalesPerson table contains SalesPerson ID and SalesPerson Name.</li>
<li>Sales table contains the sales information salesperson-wise and month-wise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add the two tables to Data Model.</li>
<li>Create a relationship between the two tables using the field SalesPerson ID.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/kpis_in_powerpivot.jpg" alt="KPIs in PowerPivot" />
<p>To set the Base Value, you need a calculated field for Sales Amount.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Add the calculated field in the Sales table for Sales Amount column in the Data Model as follows &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Total Sales:= sum([Sales Amount])</b></p>
<img src="images/set_base_value.jpg" alt="Set Base Value" />

<li><p>Change the font.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the Text Size.</p></li>
<li><p>Resize Table, 100% Stacked Bar and Card appropriately.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your Sales Performance report is ready &minus;</p>
<img src="images/sales_performance.jpg" alt="Sales Performance" />
<p>As you can observe, in the Power View you could portray the results as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Table with icons for KPI status is similar to the PowerPivot report.</p></li>
<li><p>100% Stacked Bar depicts the percentage achieved with respect to the Goal. You can also notice that it gives a clear comparison of the performance of all.</p></li>
<li><p>Card depicts the KPI status of the Salespersons along with the Region they belong to. You can interactively scroll through the Tiles to display results for different Regions that would give scope to assess performance region-wise also.</p></li>
