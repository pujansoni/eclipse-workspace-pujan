<h1>SAP HR - Introduction</h1>
<p>SAP Human Capital Management (SAP HCM) is one of the key modules in SAP and is also called SAP Human Resource (HR) or SAP Human Resource Management System (SAP HRMS). SAP HCM contains many submodules and all these modules are integrated with each other.</p>
<p>The key modules are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Organizational Management</b> &minus; Organizational Management includes Personnel development, Personnel cost planning and event management.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Management</b> &minus; Time management includes time recording, attendance, time schedule, shift management, etc.</p></li>

<h2>Organization Management</h2>
<p>Organization Management allows you to manage the enterprise structure and analyze organization plans.</p>
<p>The key features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In organization management, you can configure system settings that is required for enterprise structure, personnel cost planning, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>You can define plan version to configure various organization plans at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one plan version defines your organizational current plan.</p></li>
<li><p>You can edit, change or compare different organization plans using plan version.</p></li>
<li><p>You can have two different plan versions, one for marketing and other one for sales hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>You can compare or edit both the plans but only one plan can be used at a time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>How to set a Plan version as active?</h3>
<p>There are two ways to set a plan version.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Use the code <b>T-Code: OOPV</b></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/t_code_oopv.jpg" alt="T-Code: OOPV" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Go to IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Global Settings &rarr; Plan Version Maintenance &rarr; Maintain Plan Versions.</p>
<p>You can select from the list of available plans.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/available_plans_list.jpg" alt="Available Plans List" />
<h2>Organizational Object Types</h2>
<p>An Organization plan consists of various object types, which define the grouping of similar data together. Each object type consists of a unique object key. All object types are linked together with a relationship among each other.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; A person holding a position that is defined by a specific job.</p>
<h3>Relationship</h3>
<p>In an Organization plan, relationships are used to link different object types.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; A person holding a position in an organization and is assigned with cost center. It defines Person to position relationship and position to Organization unit.</p>
<p>While defining an hierarchical organization structure, you are creating a relationship between organization objects. When a person is holding a position in an organization unit, it means there is relationship between the position object and the organization object.</p>
<h3>Validity</h3>
<p>It determines the life of object types. At the time of object creation, you enter the start and the end time of the project and this determines the validity of the object.</p>
<p>There are various types of object types that can be defined in an organization plan. Given below are most common object types and their keys &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:60%;">Object Type</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Key</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Organizational Unit</td>
<td>O</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Person</td>
<td>P</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost Center</td>
<td>K</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Position</td>
<td>S</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Job</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Key Features of Organization Objects</h3>
<p>The key features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can create or change an existing object types, which are not managed.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; Object type person from HR Master Data.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also define the relationship between different object types that should be proposed in the course of the authorization check.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible to define an object type hierarchy to generate reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible to change the key of standard objects type- "S" for Position, "T" for task.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of Relationships &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Relationships with the same object types.</p></li>
<li><p>Relationships with different object types.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Number Ranges</h2>
<p>You can maintain different number ranges for Organization Management and Personnel administration in SAP HR. As discussed in previous topic, OM contains different object types.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:60%;">Object Type</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Key</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Organizational Unit</td>
<td>O</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Person</td>
<td>P</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost Center</td>
<td>K</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Position</td>
<td>S</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Job</td>
<td>C</td>
</table>
<p>To maintain the different number ranges for OM objects, you can use <b>T-Code: OONR</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/t_code_oonr.jpg" alt="T-Code: OONR" />
<p>You can also choose the following path.</p>
<p>Go to IMG &rarr; Personnel management &rarr; Organizational management &rarr; Basic settings &rarr; Maintain number ranges &rarr; set up number assignment for all plan versions &rarr; Execute.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/display_img.jpg" alt="Display Img" />
<p>The first two digits represent your plan version and the next two letters represent the object type.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/change_view.jpg" alt="Change View" />
<p>Similarly, you can maintain number ranges for personnel numbers. A Personnel number is generated when an employee is hired. It can be generated internally or externally.</p>
<p>The personnel number range whether internal or external should be defined at the following configuration node.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; <b>Use T-code: PA04</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; You can also go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel management &rarr; Personnel Administration &rarr; Basic settings &rarr; Maintain number range intervals for personnel numbers.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/t_code_pa04.jpg" alt="T-Code: OONR" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; A new window opens. You will see <b>Range Maintenance: Human resources</b>. Go to Intervals to display intervals.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/display_intervals.jpg" alt="Display Intervals" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; It will open a new window, <b>Maintain Intervals: Human resources</b>. You can check different number ranges for personnel number as shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/maintain_intervals.jpg" alt="Maintain Intervals" />
<p>The NR Status indicates the last personnel number assigned/used up for that respective MOLGA. MOLGA Is used to support multi-country human resource management.</p>
<h1>SAP HR - Maintaining Relationships</h1>
<p>In an Organization plan, relationships are used to link different object types.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; A person holding a position in an organization is assigned with cost center. It defines a Person to position relationship and position to Organization unit.</p>
<p>While defining a hierarchical organization structure, it means you are creating a relationship between organization objects. When a person is holding a position in an organization unit, it means there is relationship between position object and organization object.</p>
<p>A relationship can be created in both the ways- top down and bottom approach. These relationships are normally maintained in <b>HRP001</b> table. If these relationships are not standard, you may need additional tables.</p>
<p>To maintain relationship, use <b>T-Code: PP01 or PP03</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/t_code_pp01_pp03.jpg" alt="T-Code: PP01 or PP03" />
<p>A new window will open with the name <b>Maintain Object</b>.</p>
<p>Select the Object type, enter position number, give relationship and click create (F5).</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/maintain_object.jpg" alt="Maintain Object" />
<h2>Object Types and Essential Relationships</h2>
<p>Go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Organizational Management &rarr; Basic Settings &rarr; Data model enhancement &rarr; Maintain Object Types &rarr; Execute</p>
<p>To create new object type and assigning relationships follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Create new object type and assign essential relationships.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Assign object to the required Infotypes.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Maintain subtypes.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Maintain personnel actions.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Assign number range.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Maintain object via PP03 or PP01.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/object_types_essential_relationships.jpg" alt="Object Types and Essential Relationships" />
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Go to the <b>Change View “Object Types”: Overview</b> window. Click <b>New Entries</b> to create a new object type. You can also copy an existing object type.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/change_view1.jpg" alt="Change View1" />
<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/change_view2.jpg" alt="Change View2" />
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Enter Object type text, code, etc. When the object is created, assign essential relationships to it by clicking on essential relationships on the left side.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Assigning a relationship means that once an object is created, the assigned relationships are mandatory to be maintained.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining Object types is available in Table: T7780</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining Essential relationship is available in Table: T7750</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP HR - Time Constraints</h1>
<p>Time constraints are used to determine how the object type exists and how they will be updated in the HR system.</p>
<p>You can also define time constraints for object types in Organization management to have a suitable system. You need not to keep orphan object types in the system.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>O - O &rarr; Time Constraint 1</li>
<li>O - S &rarr; Time Constraint 2</li>
<li>O - K &rarr; Time Constraint 3</li>
<li>S - O &rarr; Time Constraint 4</li>
<li>S - P &rarr; Time Constraint 5</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of time constraints &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Time Constraint 1</b> is mandatory for a record to exist in the HR system and can exist one at any point of time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Constraint 2</b> is not mandatory for a record but only one exists at any point of time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Constraint 3</b> is not mandatory for a record and can have many at any point of time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Assigning Time Constraints to a relation</h3>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To assign time constraints to a relation, you have to use &minus;</p>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/time_constraints_tabs.jpg" alt="Time Constraint Tab" />
<p>You can assign appropriate time constraints to the given relationship.</p>
<p>Infotypes reactions as per time constraints &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Time Constraint 1</b> &minus; Record must have no gaps, no overlapping. If you select this Time Constraint, there should not be any gaps nor overlapping. This TC is generally used for Infotypes like, 0001, 0008, 0009 etc. where there is only one valid record.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Constraint 2</b> &minus; This TC includes those records that can include gaps but there should be no overlapping. If you select this TC, it means that you can have gaps but NO overlapping. Consider an example of the marital status of an employee. The employee has a spouse but a gap can occur in case he is divorced.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Constraint 3</b> &minus; This TC includes records that can have gaps and can exist multiple times. For example, Infotype IT0014 can have multiple records in that particular Infotype at the same time with overlapping.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Maintaining Personnel Actions</h2>
<p>In SAP HR system, personnel actions are performed for all the Infotypes that require data to be entered in the HR system. Common Infotypes that require a personnel action are hiring a new employee, termination of an employee, etc.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To perform a Personnel action, use T-Code: <b>PA 40</b> or go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Personnel Administration &rarr; Customizing Procedures &rarr; Actions.</p>

<h1>SAP HR - Maintaining Infotypes</h1>
<p>In SAP HR system, Infotypes are used to store the data for all the personnel actions and administrative tasks in the system. Infotypes are known as small units of information in SAP HR system.</p>
<p>Infotypes group the similar data together and define structure, enter data and define the information for specific period of time.</p>
<h2>Components of Infotypes</h2>
<p>An Infotype consists of the following components &minus;</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>An Infotype contains a set of similar data records in the form of data structure. Infotype contains series of information like first name, last name, date of birth, marital status, etc. When an Infotype is updated in the system, old data is not removed from the system but time is delimited.</p>
<h3>Data Entry</h3>
<p>You can enter predefined values for Infotype that helps in fetching and maintaining the data in the system. Entries in HR system are checked automatically for accuracy. Default value checks depend on the employee organization assignment.</p>
<h3>Time Dependency</h3>
<p>When an Infotype is updated in the system, old data is not erased. It is stored in the system for historical evaluation purpose. This allows each Infotype to have multiple records but all the records may vary as per their validity.</p>
<p>Time based reaction of Infotype is defined in the Time constraint field. Infotype 0000 to 0999 are Personnel Administration Infotypes. It is also possible to define permissibility of Infotype for each country, this allows you to restrict Infotype while editing the master data.</p>
<p>Go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Personnel Administration &rarr; Customizing Procedures &rarr; Infotypes &rarr; Assign Infotypes to Countries</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/time_dependency.jpg" alt="Time Dependency" />
<h2>How to Maintain Infotypes?</h2>
<p>To maintain Infotype, follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Organizational Management &rarr; Basic Setting &rarr; Data model enhancement &rarr; Infotype Maintenance &rarr; Maintain Infotypes &rarr; Execute.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/maintain_infotypes.jpg" alt="Maintain Infotypes" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Select the Infotypes to which the newly created custom object needs to be assigned. Select the Infotype and click the <b>Infotypes per object type</b> option.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/infotypes_per_object_type.jpg" alt="Infotypes Per Object Type" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; To assign custom objects to Infotype, click the <b>New Entries</b> option. You can uncheck the <b>No Maintenance</b> check box such that you can maintain custom objects via Organization Management transactions <b>PP01</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/maintain_custom_objects.jpg" alt="Maintain Custom Objects" />
<h2>Maintaining Info Subtypes</h2>
<p>Info Subtypes are known as sub units of an Infotype. Using subtype, you can easily manage and access the data in HR system and can control the Infotypes. You can easily assign different features to control the data like time constraints to sub types.</p>
<p>You can assign different control features to sub types as per requirement like TC1, TC2, and TC3.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Consider the example of an Infotype Addresses (0006). Following are the subtypes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Subtype 1</b> &minus; Permanent Residence address</p></li>
<li><p><b>Subtype 2</b> &minus; Temporary address</p></li>
<li><p><b>Subtype 3</b> &minus; Home address</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Considering Control feature – Time constraint for this Infotype, you should use TC-3 for Infotype Addresses, as we need to pass multiple values. Permanent Residence address subtype should be Time Constraint -1. Home address can exist once at any one time, hence it is Time Constraint -2.</p>
<h3>How to maintain subtypes?</h3>
<p>To maintain subtypes &minus;</p>

<h1>SAP HR - Work Schedules</h1>
<p>Various elements combine to form a complete work schedule. You can process work schedule elements that provide flexibility while you define and set the time relevant data as per business requirements. With work time elements, you can react to the changes in internal and external work time provisions, with less expenditure on time and cost.</p>
<p>You just need to make the changes to the applicable elements as per new time provision and it allows you to make the changes in work time in the work time schedule automatically.</p>
<p>Let us learn about the Work Schedule elements.</p>

<p><b>Work time model</b> &minus; It consists of a combination of the working and non-working days. Example – Mon-Friday are working days and Sat-Sun are non-working days. This work time model can repeat itself for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>You can generate work schedules by applying work schedule rule to a calendar. Working times for an employee group and for individual employees are defined as per work schedules.</p>
<p>A period work schedule is assigned to an employee in a work schedule rule. Personal work schedule is also defined for each employee while including individual time data in work schedule for several employees in Infotypes 2001 Absences, 2002 Attendances, etc.</p>
<h2>Work Schedule Rules</h2>
<p>Work Schedule rules are used to define the period when work schedule is to be used and the day of the period when work schedule is to be generated. Common work schedule rules are early or late shift timing, flexible working time and flextime.</p>

<li><p><b>Use in Holiday Cal</b> &minus; This field helps us to check if a public holiday is being used in a public holiday calendar or not. It is not possible to edit a public holiday when it is being used in a public holiday calendar. To edit a calendar, you have to remove it from all the public holiday calendars where it is used and then make the necessary changes and again re-assign the public holiday to the relevant public holiday calendars.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sort Key</b> &minus; This field helps to group together all the public holidays valid for a country. Sort key is a three-character key. It is recommended that its naming convention should be in the “Znn” format, where “nn” defines the country grouping. For example, the sort keys for public holidays for Australia and India are Australia-Z13 and India-Z40 respectively.</p></li>

<p>To use Benefits Management for a country payroll, which is not integrated, in conjunction with non-SAP payroll software or an external payroll service, you must provide your own interface for the transfer of data.</p>
<h2>Enrollment Overview</h2>
<p>Enrollment is a process of enrolling employees of an organization under the benefit management. Enrollment Plan selection for an employee depends on employee eligibility.</p>
<p>The Enrollment function allows you to enroll the employees and to make changes to the employee benefit selection as required for the following tasks &minus;</p> 
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>u2022</b> &minus; Enrollment of employees during an open enrollment period in plans for the coming Season.</p></li>
<li><p><b>u2022</b> &minus; Enrollment of new hires in plans that are automatically offered.</p></li>
<li><p><b>u2022</b> &minus; Enrollment of new hires in default plans as an interim measure, until they have made their benefits choices.</p></li>
<li><p><b>u2022</b> &minus; Adjustment of plan enrollments as a result of employee life or job changes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Enrollment</h2>
<p>Following are the types of enrollment that can be used &minus;</p>
<h3>Open Enrollment Offer</h3>
<p>An open Enrollment offer is the most unrestricted type of offer.</p>
<p>Important features &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Open enrollment type is generated by the system when you start enrollment for a date that lies within an open enrollment period.</p></li>
<li><p>It includes only those enrollment plans, which require the employees to meet some certain criteria. This is defined in customizing the field in SAP HR system.</p></li>
<li><p>Open Enrollment period is called the time period when an organization allows its employees to enroll in new benefits plans or change any existing enrollment plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Enrollment plans, which are available for selection during the open enrollment start on some specific future data and normally at the start of the new financial year.</p></li>
<li><p>The benefits offer set up for open enrollment is valid only during the open enrollment period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Consider an organization that allows an employee to select its benefits on an annual basis for the coming year. The open enrollment period is 1 Sep 2015 - 30 Sep 2015 and any new benefits that are elected by employees are valid from 1 Apr 2016 to 31 Mar 2017.</p>
<h3>Default Enrollment Offer</h3>
<p>A dynamic enrollment offer is called when employees can be enrolled before they communicate their benefits elections to the benefits office.</p>
<p>These default plans are commonly used for giving short-term coverage to new hires and therefore often allow little flexibility to the employee regarding the plan terms.</p>
<h3>Automatic Enrollment Offer</h3>
<p>Automatic enrollment plan is one in which the employees are enrolled without the requirement that they consent to the enrollment or make any elections within the plan. It allows an employee to enroll in all relevant automatic plans at all times.</p>
<p>Automatic Enrollment plans are normally provided to the employees at no extra cost and also allow little flexibility to the employee regarding the plan terms.</p>
<h3>Adjusted Enrollment Offer</h3>
<p>An organizational change or a personal change for an employee that allows an employee to change his/her current benefit elections.</p>
<p>The adjustment reason is normally a user-defined parameter to which certain adjustment permissions are assigned for different types of benefit plan.</p>
<p>Some examples of adjustment reasons are Marriage, Hiring (initial enrollment), New dependent, Job change etc.</p>
<h3>Benefit Area</h3>
<p>Using Benefit areas, you can have separate administration of different benefit plan pools. The division is performed primarily for administrational purposes and would not normally be used for eligibility. This is a primary subdivision of plan set up within the benefits component.</p>
<p>Benefit areas in SAP HR are independent from each other. They are configured and function independently. Typically, employees will be enrolled in a benefit area that groups them according to common attributes such as country or organizational assignment.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To define benefit area, go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Benefits &rarr; Basics Settings &rarr; Define Benefit Area &rarr; Execute.</p>

<h2>Benefit Category</h2>
<p>Benefit category defines the classification of benefit plans. Benefit category is always maintained in SAP HR system. Given below are the key benefit categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Health Plans</li>
<li>Insurance Plans</li>
<li>Savings Plans</li>
<li>Stock Purchase Plans</li>
<li>Flexible Spending Accounts</li>
<li>Credit Plans</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Plans</li>
</ul>
<p>In SAP HR system, all these categories are predefined and HR system handles each category differently. Benefit plan types are defined within each category to reflect your requirements.</p>
<p>Benefit Category is at the highest level in Benefit Plan structure. Benefit Categories are again divided into Plan types and every category can contain one or more Benefit Plan types.</p>
<h2>Benefit Plan type</h2>
<p>The grouping of different benefit plans is done in Benefit Plan type. You identify each benefit plan with a unique identifier - maximum four characters.</p>
<p>Following are common Benefit plan types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>MEDI</b> &minus; stands for Medical plan and belongs to Health Plan Category</p></li>
<li><p><b>SAVE</b> &minus; stands for Savings and belongs to Savings Plans Category</p></li>
<li><p><b>STPC</b> &minus; stands for Stock purchase and belongs to stock Option Category</p></li>
<li><p><b>DCAR</b> &minus; stands for dependent care spending and belongs to flexible spending Accts</p></li>
<li><p><b>LIFE</b> &minus; stands for Life Insurance and belongs to Insurance Plans Category</p></li>
<li><p><b>CRED</b> &minus; stands for flex credit and belongs to Credit Plans Category</p></li>
<li><p><b>CAR</b> &minus; stands for Company car and belongs to Miscellaneous Plans Category</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Benefit Plan types are used for enrollment and the system does not allow an employee to enroll in more than one benefit plan per plan type.</p>
<h2>Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>Benefit plan structure at the granularity level is defined by Benefit Plans. You can group multiple Benefit plans under a particular plan type. All the benefit Plans are identified with a unique identifier, which consists of maximum of four characters as mentioned above.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p><b>MEDI, VISI, DENT</b> represents health Plans Category for medical MEDI Plan Type.</p>
<p>Benefit plans within the health plan category cover the basic health needs of an employee. A typical health plan might provide an employee with medical, dental or vision coverage.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can have an Insurance plan, which is used to provide monetary amounts of coverage payable to the employees in an organization.</p>
<p>To setup account balance to meet spending needs, a spending account can be used that provides an employee with the opportunity to establish account balances. Most common needs that can be associated with spending account includes health, dependent care, and legal benefit, etc.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Following are the common benefit plan types for each of the plan categories &minus;</p>
<h3>Health Plans</h3>
<ul class="list">

<h1>SAP HR - Payroll Management</h1>
<p>Payroll is one of the key components in SAP HR module and is used to process payroll of employees in an organization.</p>
<p>Important features are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Payroll can be integrated with Personnel administration, time management, wages and accounting.</p></li>
<li><p>Data retention allows you to use master data and other payroll related data from Personnel Administration.</p></li>
<li><p>Time data from Time Management is included in Payroll and is used during the payroll run.</p></li>
<li><p>Incentive Wages component is used to process payroll directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Expenses and payable information from SAP Payroll component is posted directly in Financial Accounting FICO to assign a cost center for all the costs.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP Payroll system also calculates the gross pay and the net pay. It consists of payments for each employee and deductions made during a payroll period. All payments and deductions are included in the remuneration calculation using different wage types.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Payroll Control Record</h2>
<p>Payroll control record is used to run the payroll process in HR system. Payroll Control record is used to lock the master data during the payroll run and thus lock the changes during payroll processing.</p>
<p>You have to set up Payroll control record manually for each part of payroll run.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to set up the Payroll control record.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Use the T-Code: PA03. Select the Payroll area and click the change icon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/tcode_pa03.jpg" alt="T-Code PA03" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; A new window opens as depicted in the screenshot.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/new_window_opens_depicted.jpg" alt="New Window Opens Depicted" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Payroll Status</b> &minus; This determines the status of payroll run. It also defines the current payroll period and number of times a payroll has been run.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Earliest retro acctg period</b> &minus; This indicates the greatest earliest payroll period for retroactive accounting.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Last change to personnel control record</b> &minus; This shows the details of the person who has changed Payroll Control Record and what kind of changes are made.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Options in Payroll Control Record</h2>
<p>Following options are available in payroll control record screen &minus;</p>
<p><b>Incorrect Personnel Numbers</b> &minus; This is used to check the number of employees rejected in last payroll run.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/incorrect_personnel_numbers.jpg" alt="Incorrect Personnel Numbers" />
<p><b>List Personnel Numbers</b> &minus; This is used to get a list of employees included in the payroll area.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/list_personnel_numbers.jpg" alt="List Personnel Numbers" />
<p><b>Locked Personnel Numbers</b> &minus; This is used to obtain a list of employees locked out of payroll in Infotype 0003 (Payroll Status in SAP HR, stopping the ability to execute a payroll run for them.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/locked_personnel_numbers.jpg" alt="Locked Personnel Numbers" />
<p>The Payroll control record is necessary for payroll run &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Release mode</b> &minus; If you want to run payroll in update status, release mode should be used.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Corrections</b> &minus; means data can be changed. Must subsequently move into release mode to update that data change.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Check payroll results</b> &minus; You can’t change the data in this mode. It is used to run the reports related to payroll.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Exit mode</b> &minus; When payroll run is completed, exit model is selected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP HR - Basic Pay Infotypes</h1>
<p>Basic pay information of an employee is stored in basic pay Infotype (0008). An employee’s payroll history can be checked using Infotype history.</p>
<p>In case an employee leaves an organization, the basic payroll data for that employee remains in the system to ensure accuracy of any retroactive account runs to be performed. A basic pay Infotype 0008 can be processed itself with a personnel action. To create a new record you need to enter payment type on maintain HR master data screen.</p>
<p>The standard system contains the following payment types as subtypes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Basic contract</li>
<li>Increase basic contract</li>
<li>Comparable domestic pay</li>
<li>Refund of costs in foreign currency</li>
<li>Local weighting allowance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pay Scale Reclassification</h2>
<p>A pay scale reclassification involves moving an employee to a new pay scale group and to a different pay scale level. In this case, an employee receives the remuneration for the new pay level assignment.</p>
<p>A pay scale reclassification is performed in a payroll period prior to running the payroll. The pay scale reclassification must always take place before the standard pay increase.</p>
<p>To perform pay scale reclassification, go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Personnel Administration &rarr; Payroll Data &rarr; Basic Pay &rarr; Pay Scale Changes &rarr; Pay Scale reclassification &rarr; Specify pay scale reclassification.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/pay_scale_reclassification.jpg" alt="Pay Scale Reclassification" />
<h2>Pay Scale Structure</h2>
<p>A pay scale Structure consists of the following components &minus;</p>
<h3>Pay Scale Area</h3>
<p>A pay scale area is used to define a geographical area where a collective agreement is valid. The geographical area is determined by the size of pay scale area.</p>
<p>A pay scale area is defined in Customizing Personnel administration and is identified by four character alphanumeric identifier per country. You also define pay scale groups and levels for each pay scale type and employee subgroup grouping in a pay scale area.</p>
<p>The default values are suggested for payscale type and groups and linked to personnel subarea when you create a record in basic pay Infotype (0008).</p>
<h3>Pay Scale Type</h3>
<p>A Pay scale type is used to define the area of economic activity for which an agreement is valid. The geographical area in which it is valid is applied to the full company.</p>
<p>Pay scale type is also defined in customizing Personnel administration and is identified by four character alphanumeric identifier per country. You define pay scale groups and level for each pay scale area and employee subgroup grouping in each pay scale type.</p>
<h3>Pay Scale Group and Level</h3>
<p>A Pay scale groups and pay scale levels are used to define the criteria to classify data for job evaluations and indirect valuations. Each pay scale groups is further divided in pay scale levels.</p>
<p>In customizing for Personnel administration, you define pay scale groups and levels per country grouping, pay scale area, type and employee subgroup grouping.</p>
<p>A pay scale group is defined with an alphanumeric identifier with a maximum of eight characters and pay scale levels are described with a two-character alphanumeric identifier.</p>
<h1>SAP HR - Primary &amp; Secondary Wage Types</h1>
<p>Wage type is one of the key components in payroll processing. Based on the way they store information, wage type can be divided into two categories.</p>
<h2>Primary Wage Type</h2>
<p>Primary wage type is defined as wage type for which data is entered in Infotype. Primary wage types are created by copying model wage types provided by SAP. There are different type of primary wage types &minus;</p>
<h3>Time wage type</h3>
<p>Time wage type is used to store the time related information. This wage type is used to combine payroll and time management. Time wage type is generated at time evaluation and configure through T510S or using custom PCR.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/time_wage_type.jpg" alt="Time Wage Type" />
<h2>Dialogue Wage Type</h2>
<p>These wage type includes basic pay IT0008, recurring payments and deductions IT0014, and additional payments IT0015.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/dialogue_wage_type.jpg" alt="Dialogue Wage Type" />
<h2>Secondary Wage or Technical Wage Type</h2>
<p>Secondary wage types are predefined wage types in SAP system and starts with a slash (/). These wage types are created during payroll run.</p>
<p>These wage types are system generated and cannot be maintained online.</p>
<p>/559 Bank Transfer</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hr/images/secondary_or_technical_wage_type.jpg" alt="Secondary or Technical Wage Type" />
<h3>Wage type Elements:</h3>
<p>Key elements of a wage type include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Amount AMT</li>
<li>Rate RTE</li>
<li>Number NUM</li>
</ul>
<p>As per processing type each element can have one, two or all element values.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Basic pay can have Rate and Number. However, a bonus pay can have only amount.</p>
<h1>SAP HR - Payroll Process</h1>
<p>Payroll is processed to calculate the basic salary for the employees and other payments like overtime, shift allowance, and other bonuses. A payroll is processed at certain point of time.</p>
<p>You need to mention the payroll area for which payroll should run. To execute payroll run for multiple payroll areas, you need to run the individually for each payroll area. To lock a payroll for a particular employee, you should use lock Personnel number function.</p>
<p>Payroll control record is used to control the payroll process as mentioned in previous topics and status of payroll control record is automatically changed with each step performed in payroll run.</p>
<h2>Payroll Areas to Run Payroll</h2>
<p>When a payroll is run for a payroll area, SAP system increases the period number in the payroll control record by one. It is not possible to change the master and time data for the personnel numbers belonging to the current payroll area if it affects the payroll past or present.</p>
<h3>Payroll Run</h3>
<p>This is used to determine the current payroll period from the payroll control record and performs payroll using the values you entered in the payroll program.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You have to check if the payroll process has completed successfully or any errors have occurred. When the payroll runs with errors, system displays error messages. You can get a descriptive payroll log.</p></li>
<li><p>You can put the payroll status to check the payroll results during this phase. This way you make sure that no changes are made to the payroll-relevant data which could affect the payroll past or present.</p></li>
<li><p>You can put a check on the results of payroll run after completion.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also get a report that tells you the stored payroll result. Using this report, each employee can see the contents of all internal tables that has payroll results and you can also check all partial runs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Correcting master or time data for payroll run errors</h3>
<p>In the Payroll Status Infotype (0003), the system also flags the payroll correction field for all the rejected personnel numbers. In case you correct the master or time data for a personnel number, this field is also flagged.</p>
<p>All personnel numbers for which the master data is corrected are grouped again in a list- Matchcode W. The next step is the payroll correction run, which involves payroll run for this matchcode W (only for corrected personnel numbers).</p>
<h3>Release payroll</h3>
<p>When you have many employees in the correction run, you can run the correction payroll run as a background job. However, if there are only few employees, it can also be run online like a regular payroll run.</p>
<h3>Posting to Accounting</h3>
<p>In few cases, errors can popup, which means that you should change the master and time data again. If it occurs then run the payroll correction and this means posting to accounting again. In the end, you exit the payroll.</p>
<h1>SAP HR - Gross Pay</h1>
<p>In SAP HR system, a gross salary is known as an agreed compensation that an organization agrees to pay to an employee on a monthly basis for the work that he does for that company in that specific period.</p>
<p>You can define net salary as gross salary minus all the deductions that are made because of statutory compliances of a country and organization such as EPF, ESI, Income Tax, etc. It includes other dues like home loans, car loans and advance salary taken, which you owe to the company and any legal dues that an employee has to pay.</p>
<p>CTC or Cost to Company is defined as gross salary &plus; Benefits, Perks and is called as total Cost to company.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Consider the following example &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

</table>
<p>CTC (Cost to Company) INR 2, 65,832 annually (i.e. CTC = Monthly Gross Salary &times; 12 &plus; Annual benefits)</p>
<h3>Bonuses and Recurring Payments</h3>
<p>For recurring payment/deductions, an Infotype 0014 is used. Recurring payments and deductions are the payment types that are not deducted or paid in every payroll.</p>
<p><b>To execute the recurring payment, below information is required</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Wage type</b> &minus; It requires wage type to process the payment.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Number/Unit</b> &minus; This depends on the wage type and the system checks the combination entered.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Currency</b> &minus; The currency varies as per the company code. The system automatically suggests the currency to be used as per the company code.</p></li>
<li><p><b>First payment date and interval/unit</b> &minus; This determines the recurring payment to be made and it automatically identifies when the payments are to be made. When there is no entry for this field, by default, the system makes payment as per wage type in each payroll period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Payroll Cycle &amp; Time Management Data</h2>
<p>To use all the features in SAP HR system, you need to store master data for all employees in SAP Human Resource system.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:30%">001</td>
<td>Organizational Data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>

<li><p>You can also get a report that tells you the stored payroll result. Using this report, each employee can see the contents of all internal tables that has payroll results and you can also check all partial runs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Payroll Integration</h2>
<p>Payroll is normally integrated to these systems - FI/CO, Benefits, Time Management and Expenses.</p>

<li><p>You can put a check on the results of payroll run after completion.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also get a report that tells you the stored payroll result. Using this report, each employee can see the contents of all internal tables that has payroll results and you can also check all partial runs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Correcting master or time data for payroll run errors</h3>
<p>In the Payroll Status Infotype (0003), the system also flags the payroll correction field for all the rejected personnel numbers. In case you correct the master or time data for a personnel number, this field is also flagged.</p>
<p>All personnel numbers for which the master data is corrected are grouped again in a list- Matchcode W. The next step is the payroll correction run, which involves payroll run for this matchcode W (only for corrected personnel numbers).</p>
<h3>Release payroll</h3>
<p>When you have many employees in the correction run, you can run the correction payroll run as a background job. However, if there are only few employees, it can also be run online like a regular payroll run.</p>
<h3>Posting to Accounting</h3>
<p>In few cases, errors can popup, which means that you should change the master and time data again. If it occurs then run the payroll correction and this means posting to accounting again. In the end, you exit the payroll.</p>
<h2>Remuneration Statement</h2>
<p>When the payroll is run, a pay slip is generated and this is the first report that is used after payroll processing. Pay slip is also called Remuneration statement.</p>
<p>Processing of payroll and generating statements vary each month as per the different input types and payment type in each month.</p>
