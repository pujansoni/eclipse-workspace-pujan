</ul>
<h2>India - Structure</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Based on geological history, India is divided into three regions. The regions are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Peninsular Block;</p></li>
<li><p>The Himalayas &amp; other Peninsular Mountains; and</p></li>
<li><p>Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra Plain.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The <b>Peninsular Block</b> is formed essentially by a great complex of very ancient gneisses and granites.</p></li>
<li><p>The Peninsular Block mostly consists of relicts and residual mountains like the <i>Aravali</i> hills, the <i>Nallamala</i> hills, the <i>Javadi</i> hills, the <i>Veliconda</i> hills, the <i>Palkonda</i> range, the <i>Mahendragiri</i> hills, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike the rigid and stable Peninsular Block, the <b>Himalayan Mountains</b> are young, weak, and flexible in their geological structure.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra Plain</b> comprises the plains formed by the river Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra Plain is a geo-synclinal depression, which attained its maximum development during the third phase of the Himalayan mountain formation, approximately about 64 million years ago.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Physiography</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>India’s physiography is divided into <b>six</b> following regions &minus;</p>

</ul>
<img src="images/himalaya.jpg" alt="Himalayas" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Himalayan Ranges include the <b>Greater Himalaya, Lesser/Middle Himalaya,</b> and the <b>Siwalik Range</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on relief, alignment of ranges and other geomorphological features, the Himalayas can be divided into the following sub-divisions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Kashmir or Northwestern Himalayas</p></li>
<li><p>Himachal and Uttaranchal Himalayas</p></li>
<li><p>Darjeeling and Sikkim Himalayas</p></li>
<li><p>Arunachal Himalayas</p></li>
<li><p>Eastern Hills and Mountains.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kashmir or Northwestern Himalayas</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Kashmir or Northwestern Himalayas consist of a series of ranges such as the <i>Karakoram, Ladakh, Zanskar</i>, and <i>Pir Panjal</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>Important glaciers of South Asia, i.e., the <i>Baltoro</i> and <i>Siachen</i> are found in the Northwestern Himalayan region.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kashmir Himalayas are also popular for the <i>Karewa</i> formations, which are useful for the cultivation of <i>Zafran</i>, a local variety of saffron.</p></li>
<li><p>Karewas are the thick deposits of glacial clay and other materials embedded with moraines.</p></li>
<li><p>Important passes of the Northwestern Himalayas are <i>Zoji La</i> on the Great Himalayas, <i>Banihal</i> on the Pir Panjal, and <i>Khardung La</i> on the Ladakh range.</p></li>
<li><p>Important fresh lakes are <i>Dal</i> and <i>Wular</i> and salt water lakes are <i>Pangong Tso</i> and <i>Tso Moriri</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The southernmost part of the Northwestern Himalayas consists of longitudinal valleys locally known as <i>duns</i>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Himachal and Uttaranchal Himalayas</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Himachal and Uttarakhand Himalayas are located approximately between the rivers Ravi in the west and the Kali (a tributary of Ghaghara) in the east.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Darjeeling and Sikkim Himalayas</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Darjeeling and Sikkim Himalayas are flanked by the Nepal Himalayas in the west and the Bhutan Himalayas in the east.</p></li>

</ul>
<h2>Northern Plains</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">

</ul>
<img src="images/river_india.jpg" alt="River India" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>About 77% of the drainage area consisting of the <i>Ganga</i>, the <i>Brahmaputra</i>, the <i>Mahanadi</i>, the <i>Krishna</i>, etc. is oriented towards the Bay of Bengal.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, 23% comprising the <i>Indus</i>, the <i>Narmada</i>, the <i>Tapi</i>, the <i>Mahi</i>, and the <i>Periyar</i> systems discharge their waters in the Arabian Sea.</p></li>
<li><p>A river drain is a specific area, which is known as the <b>catchment area</b> of that river.</p></li>

<h1>Geography India - Climate</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="images/india_weather.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/india_weather.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="India Weather" /></a>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Weather</b> is the temporary state of the atmosphere, while <b>climate</b> refers to the average of the weather conditions over a longer period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather changes quickly, may be within a day or week, but climate changes in imperceptivity and may be noted after 50, 100 years, or even more.</p></li>
<li><p>The climate of India has distinct regional variations discernible by the pattern of winds, temperature, and rainfall; further, also in the form of rhythm of seasons and the degree of wetness or dryness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Factors Influencing Climate</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Major factors that determine the climate of India are &minus;
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>The Himalayan Mountains</li>
<li>Distribution of land and water</li>
<li>Distance from the sea</li>
<li>Altitude</li>
<li>Relief</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Winter</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the <b>winter</b>, north of the Himalayas develops a high pressure center.</p></li>
<li><p>This high pressure center gives rise to the flow of air at the low level from the north towards the Indian subcontinent (i.e. south of the mountain range).</p></li>
<li><p>All of Western and Central Asia remains under the influence of westerly winds (known as <b>Jet Stream</b>) along the altitude of <b>9-13 km</b> from west to east.</p></li>
<li><p>These winds blow across the Asian continent at the latitudes, north of the Himalayas, roughly parallel to the Tibetan highlands.</p></li>
<li><p>However, Tibetan highlands act as a barrier in the path of these jet streams, as a result of this, the jet streams get bifurcated into two branches.</p></li>
<li><p>One branch is located to the south of the Himalayas, while the second branch is positioned to the north of Tibetan Plateau.</p></li>
<li><p>The western cyclonic disturbances, which enter the Indian subcontinent from the west and the northwest during the winter months, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and are brought into India by the westerly jet stream.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Summer</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the <b>Summer</b>, the wind circulation over the subcontinent undergoes a complete reversal at both, the lower as well as at the upper levels.</p></li>
<li><p>By the middle of July, the low pressure belt nearer the surface [termed as <b>Inter Tropical Convergence Zone </b>(ITCZ)] moves northwards, roughly parallel to the Himalayas between $20^{\circ}N$ and $25^{\circ}N$ (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
</ul>
<a href="images/itcz.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/itcz.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="ITCZ" /></a>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The ITCZ is a zone of low pressure, attracts inflow of winds from different directions.</p></li>
<li><p>With the apparent northward movement of the Sun towards the Tropic of Cancer in March, temperatures start rising in north India, which is the sign of advent of Summer season.</p></li>
<li><p>April, May, and June are the months of summer in north India.</p></li>
<li><p>In the heart of the ITCZ in the northwest, the dry and hot winds known as <b><i>Loo</i></b>, blow in the afternoon, and very often, they continue to well into midnight.</p></li>
<li><p>Towards the end of the summer, there are pre-monsoon showers, which are a common phenomenon in Kerala and coastal areas of Karnataka. This phenomenon is locally known as <b>mango showers</b>, as it helps in the early ripening of mangoes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Monsoon</h2>
<a href="images/india_climate.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/india_climate.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="India Climate" /></a>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The maritime tropical air mass (mT) from the southern hemisphere crosses the equator and rushes towards the low pressure area; in general, the southwesterly direction.</p></li>
<li><p>This moist air current causing rainfall in India is popularly known as the <b>southwest monsoon</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Simultaneously, an <b>easterly jet stream</b> flows over the southern part of the Peninsula in June with a maximum speed of 90 km per hour.</p></li>
<li><p>The easterly jet stream steers the tropical depressions into India and these depressions play a significant role in determining the distribution of monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent.</p></li>
<li><p>The tracks of these depressions are the areas of the highest rainfall in India.</p></li>
<li><p>The southwest monsoon, which is a continuation of the southeast trades, get deflected towards the Indian subcontinent after crossing the Equator.</p></li>
<li><p>The easterly jet stream is held responsible for the burst of the monsoon in India.</p></li>
<li><p>The southwest monsoon sets first over the Kerala coast by $1^{st}$ of June and then moves swiftly to reach Mumbai and Kolkata between $10^{th}$ and $13^{th}$ June. Further, by mid-July, southwest monsoon engulfs the entire subcontinent.</p></li>
<li><p>Southwest monsoon gets divided into two branches &minus; the <b>Arabian Sea</b>, causing rain in western coast of India and the <b>Bay of Bengal branch</b>, causing rain in eastern coast to India.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, the cold weather season sets in by mid-November in northern India.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the Peninsular region of India does not have any well-defined cold weather season.</p></li>
<li><p>There is hardly any seasonal change in the distribution pattern of the temperature in coastal areas because of the moderating influence of the sea and the proximity to the equator.</p></li>
<li><p>Winter monsoons do not cause rainfall, as they move from land to the sea. Hence, primarily, they have little humidity; and secondly, due to anticyclonic circulation on land, the possibility of rainfall from them reduces.</p></li>
<li><p>However, in northwestern India, some weak temperate cyclones coming from the Mediterranean Sea (with little moisture) cause rainfall in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and western Uttar Pradesh.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, during October and November, northeast monsoon while crossing over the Bay of Bengal, picks up moisture and causes torrential rainfall over the Tamil Nadu coast, southern Andhra Pradesh, southeast Karnataka, and southeast Kerala.</p></li>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The shower causing coffee flowers blossom in Kerala and nearby areas is known as <b>blossom shower</b>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Nor Westers</b> are the dreaded evening thunderstorms in Bengal and Assam.</p></li>
<li><p>During the south-west monsoon, the period after having rains for a few days, if rain fails to occur for one or more weeks, it is known as <b>break in the monsoon</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The notorious nature of Nor Westers can be understood from the local nomenclature of <b><i>Kalbaisakhi</i></b>, meaning a calamity of the month of <i>Baisakh</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>In Assam, Nor Westers are known as <b><i>Bardoli Chheerha</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hot, dry, and oppressing winds blowing in the Northern plains from Punjab to Bihar are known as <b><i>Loo</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The rain in the southwest monsoon season begins rather abruptly.</p></li>
<li><p>Sudden onset of the moisture-laden winds associated with violent thunder and lightning, is often termed as the <b>“break”</b> or <b>“burst”</b> of the monsoon.</p></li>
<li><p>Tamil Nadu coast remains dry during the monsoon season because it is situated parallel to the Bay of Bengal branch of southwest monsoon.</p></li>
<li><p>The monsoon rainfall has a declining trend with increasing distance from the sea. For example, Kolkata receives 119 cm, Patna 105 cm, Allahabad 76 cm, and Delhi 56 cm.</p></li>
<li><p>The months of October and November are known as <b>retreating monsoons</b> season.</p></li>
<li><p>The advent of south-west monsoon is known as advancing monsoon.</p></li>
<li><p>As the south-west monsoon passes over the ocean surface (Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal) it picks up moisture and causes rainfall in India.</p></li>
<li><p>Windward side of Western Ghats receives heavy rainfall (more than 250 cm); however, as the distance increases from the sea, the amount and intensity of rainfall start decreasing.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bay of Bengal branch of monsoon advances towards the eastern part of India and causes heavy rainfall. North-east India receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon season.</p></li>
<li><p><b><i>Cherapunji</i></b> and <b><i>Mawsynram</i></b> (two places of Meghalaya) are world’s wettest place.</p></li>
<li><p>Though there are great spatial variations in India; the average annual rainfall of India is <b>125 cm</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole of India has a <b>monsoon</b> type of climate, but because of the regional variations, there are various types of climate in India.</p></li>

<li><p>Tropical evergreen forests are found in the western slope of the Western Ghats, hills of the northeastern region, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p></li>
<li><p>In tropical evergreen forests, trees reach great heights, i.e., up to 60 m or even above. And, largely these trees do not have fixed time to shed their leaves.</p></li>
<li><p>Major examples of evergreen forests are <i>rosewood, mahogany, aini, ebony,</i> etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Semi-evergreen Forests</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Semi-evergreen forests are a mixture of evergreen and moist deciduous trees, found in the regions that receive less precipitation than the evergreen forests.</p></li>
<li><p>Main species of semi-evergreen forests are white <i>cedar, hillock,</i> and <i>kail</i>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Tropical Deciduous Forests</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">

<h1>Geography India - Soil</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Soil is very important and a valuable resource for every human being.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil is the mixture of rock debris and organic materials, which develop on the earth’s surface.</p></li>
<li><p>The major factors that determine soils’ characteristics are parent material, climate, relief, vegetation, time, and some other life-forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Major constituents of the soil are mineral particles, humus, water, and air.</p></li>
<li><p>A soil horizon is a layer generally parallel to the soil crust, whose physical characteristics differ from the layers above and beneath.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Soil Profile</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Soil Horizon is classified into <b>three</b> categories &minus; Horizon A, Horizon B, and Horizon C; collectively known as <b>Soil Profile</b> (i.e. the arrangement of soil layers).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/soil_profile.jpg" alt="Soil Profile" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Horizon A’ is the topmost zone, where organic materials stored with the minerals, nutrients, and water, necessary for the growth of the plants.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Horizon B’ is the transition zone between the ‘horizon A’ and ‘horizon C’, and hence, it contains matter derived from ‘horizon A’ as well as from ‘horizon C’.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Horizon C’ is composed of loose parent material and hence, it is the layer of first stage of the soil formation process and eventually forms the above discussed two layers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification of Soil</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Soils were classified on the basis of their inherent characteristics and external features including texture, color, slope of land, and moisture content in the soil.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil Survey of India, established in <b>1956</b>, made comprehensive study of soils.</p></li>
</ul>
<a href="images/indian_soil.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/indian_soil.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Indian Soil" /></a>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>On the basis of genesis, color, composition, and location, the soils of India have been classified as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Alluvial soils</p></li>
<li><p>Black soils</p></li>
<li><p>Red and Yellow soils</p></li>
<li><p>Laterite soils</p></li>
<li><p>Arid soils</p></li>
<li><p>Forest soils</p></li>
<li><p>Saline soils</p></li>
<li><p>Peaty soils.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alluvial Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Alluvial soils are widespread in the northern plains and the river valleys and cover about 40% of total area of India.</p></li>
<li><p>Alluvial soils are depositional soils, as transported and deposited by the rivers streams.</p></li>
<li><p>Alluvial soils are normally rich in potash, but poor in phosphorous.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Upper and Middle Ganga plain, two different types of alluvial soils are found i.e. <b><i>Khadar</i></b> (it is the new alluvium and is deposited by floods annually) and <b><i>Bhangar</i></b> (it is a system of older alluvium, deposited away from the flood plains).</p></li>
<li><p>The alluvial soils normally vary in nature from sandy, loamy, to clayey and its color varies from light grey to ash grey.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Black Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Also popular as <b>Regur Soil</b> or the <b>Black Cotton Soil</b>, Black soil covers most of the Deccan Plateau; for example, black soil is found in parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/black_soil.jpg" alt="Black Soil" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Black soil is usually clayey, deep, and impermeable; therefore, it can retain the moisture for a very long time (very useful for the crops especially cotton).</p></li>
<li><p>Black soil is rich in lime, iron, magnesia, alumina, and also potash.</p></li>
<li><p>The color of the black soil varies from deep black to grey.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Red &amp; Yellow Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in the areas of low rainfall, especially, in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan Plateau.</p></li>
<li><p>Red soil develops a reddish color because of a wide diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. On the other hand, it develops yellow color when it occurs in a hydrated form.</p></li>
<li><p>The fine-grained red and yellow soils are usually fertile, whereas coarse-grained soils found in dry upland areas have poor fertility.</p></li>
<li><p>The red and yellow soils normally have poor content of nitrogen, phosphorous and humus.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Laterite Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The laterite soils develop in areas of high temperature and high rainfall.</p></li>
<li><p>The laterite soils are commonly found in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and the hilly areas of Odisha and Assam.</p></li>
<li><p>Laterite soils are the result of intense leaching due to tropical rains; because of rain, lime and silica are leached away, and soils become rich in iron oxide and aluminum.</p></li>
<li><p>Laterite soils however are poor in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphate, and calcium, but rich in iron oxide and potash.</p></li>
<li><p>Laterite soils are normally infertile; however, it is widely to make bricks (used in building construction).</p></li>
<li><p>Normally sandy in structure and saline in nature, arid soils vary from red to brown in color.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Arid Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Lower horizons of the arid soils are occupied by <i>‘kankar’</i> layers because of the increasing calcium content downwards.</p></li>
<li><p>Arid soils have poor content of humus and organic matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Arid soils are typically developed in western Rajasthan.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Saline Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Saline soils contain a larger proportion of sodium, potassium, and magnesium, and thus, they are infertile, and do not support vegetation.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the dry climate and poor drainage system, saline soil contains more salt.</p></li>
<li><p>Saline soils are normally found in arid and semi-arid regions, as well as in waterlogged and swampy areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Deficient in nitrogen and calcium, saline soils are found in western Gujarat, deltas of the eastern coast, and in <i>Sunderban</i> areas of West Bengal.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Forests Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Forest soils are usually formed in the forest areas where sufficient rainfall is available.</p></li>
<li><p>Like other organism, soils are living systems, as they too develop and decay, get degraded, and respond to proper treatment if administered in time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Peaty Soils</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In the areas of heavy rainfall and high humidity, large quantity of dead organic matter accumulates and enrich humus and organic content that forms the peaty soils.</p></li>
<li><p>Peaty soils are normally heavy and black in color and widely found in the northern part of Bihar, southern part of Uttaranchal, and the coastal areas of West Bengal, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu.</p></li>
<li><p>Decline in soil fertility because of any reason (either natural or human induced) is known as <b>soil degradation</b> (example shown in the image given below).</p></li>

<h1>Geography India - Land Resources</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Land use record is maintained by the Land Revenue Department.</p></li>
<li><p>The Survey of India is accountable for measuring geographical area of administrative units in India.</p></li>
<li><p>There is difference between the actual forest area and the forest area defined by the Government.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Categories of Land</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Land under settlements (i.e. rural and urban), infrastructure (i.e. roads, canals, industries, shops, etc.) are kept under the category of <b>Non-Agricultural Land</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Barren hilly terrains, desert lands, ravines, etc. normally are not suitable for cultivation, hence, they are known as <b>Barren</b> and <b>Wastelands</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The land owned by the village panchayat comes under <b>‘Common Property Resources’</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any land, which is left fallow (uncultivated) for more than five years is categorized as <b>Culturable Wasteland</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/agricultural_land.jpg" alt="Agricultural Land" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The land, which is left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural year is known as <b>Current Fallow</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The physical extent of the land on which crops are sown and harvested is known as <b>Net Sown Area</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Land use pattern changes with time and the nature of economic activities carried out in that region.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result of increase in population, change in income levels, available technology, and associated factors, pressure on land increases and marginal lands come under use.</p></li>
<li><p>When secondary and tertiary sectors grow much faster than primary sector, then agricultural land changes into non-agricultural land.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, India has undergone major changes within the economy over the past four or five decades, and it has influenced the land-use changes in the country.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the changing structure of the Indian economy, the rate of increase of non-agricultural land is very fast.</p></li>

<h1>Geography India - Settlement</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A cluster of dwellings of any type and size where human beings live is known as human settlement.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/rural_settlement.jpg" alt="Rural settlement" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>On the basis of size and type, patterns of human settlement are studied; hence, a settlement could be very small (e.g. hamlet) and could be very large (e.g. metropolitan city).</p></li>
<li><p>The sparsely populated settlement whose main occupation is agricultural and other primary sector activities, is known as village.</p></li>
<li><p>Large and densely populated settlement whose main occupational specialization is in tertiary activities is known as urban settlement.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Patterns of Settlement</h2>
<p>The pattern of human settlement is practically influenced by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Physical features</b> (e.g. relief feature, climate, and availability of water);</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cultural and ethnic factors</b> (e.g. social structure, caste, and religion);</p></li>

<h1>Geography India - Migration</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During colonial period (i.e. British period) millions of the indentured laborers were sent to Mauritius, Caribbean islands (Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana), Fiji, and South Africa by British Government largely from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/migration.jpg" alt="Migration" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>All such migrations were covered under time-bound contracts known as <b>Girmit Act</b> (Indian Emigration Act).</p></li>
<li><p>The recent wave of migrants consists of professionals including software engineers, doctors, engineers, management consultants, financial experts, and media persons to countries like USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Migration Facts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The first major modification was done in 1961 Census, as two additional components i.e. <b>place of birth</b> (village or town) and <b>duration of residence</b> (if born elsewhere) were added.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, in 1971, another component added i.e. on place of last residence and duration of stay at the place of enumeration.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1981, Information on reasons for migration were incorporated.</p></li>
<li><p>According to 2001 census, out of total 1,029 million population, 307 million (30 per cent) were reported as migrants in terms of place of birth.</p></li>
<li><p>Under the intra-state migration, numbers of female migrants are more than male (marriage related migration).</p></li>
<li><p>As per the census 2001, India has recorded that more than 5 million persons have migrated to India from other countries; largely, from the neighboring countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.</p></li>
<li><p>As per the census 2001, there are about 20 million people of Indian Diaspora, spread across the 110 countries of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of <b>in-migration</b>, Maharashtra occupied the first place (2.3 million net in-migrants), followed by Delhi, Gujarat, and Haryana.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, in terms of <b>out-migration</b>, Uttar Pradesh (-2.6 million) and Bihar (-1.7 million) were the top states.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of the <b>urban agglomeration</b> (UA), Greater Mumbai had received the maximum number of in-migrants.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes of Migration</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Causes of migration are categorized as <b>‘push factor’</b> and <b>‘pull factor’</b>. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Push factors</b> force people to migrate; for example, unemployment, lack of infrastructure (such as hospital, education institutions, etc.), natural disasters (such as flood, drought, earthquake, cyclone, etc.), local conflicts, war, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pull factors</b> attract people from different places; for example, better opportunities for education and employment; better health facilities; and various sources of entertainment, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/indian_internal_migration.jpg"  alt="International Migration" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Normally, the reason behind female migration throughout India is largely marriage related; however, Meghalaya has a reverse scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>Remittances from the international migrants are one of the major sources of foreign exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>For thousands of the poor villages of states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, etc. remittance acts as life blood for their subsistence.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Impacts of Migration </h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Development of slums in industrially developed states, such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and metropolitan areas, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, etc. is a negative consequence of unregulated migration within the country.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the major negative impacts of migration is imbalances in age and sex composition at both the places &minus; sending region (out-migration) and receiving region (in-migration).</p></li>
<li><p>Migration intermixes people of diverse cultural backgrounds</p></li>
<li><p>Because of unbalanced migration, the receiving regions (especially urban areas) are facing many environmental problems, such as pollution, depletion of ground water, solid waste management problems, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Geography India - Regional Development</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>India has centralized planning and the task of planning in India has been entrusted to the Planning Commission of India.</p></li>
<li><p>Planning Commission of India is a statutory body headed by the Prime Minister and has a Deputy Chairman and other members.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the Planning Commission of India is recently is now <b>“National Institution for Transforming India”</b> or simply <b>NITI Aayog</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The planning in the country is largely carried out through the array of <b>Five Year Plans</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>At present, the <b>Twelfth</b> Five Year Plan is running, which was initiated in 2012 with a focus on ‘Faster, More Inclusive and Sustainable Growth’.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Approaches of Planning</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Normally, there are two approaches of planning. They are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Sectoral planning</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Regional planning.</b></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sectoral Planning</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Sectoral planning means formulation and implementation of the sets of schemes or programs aimed at development of various sectors of the economy such as agriculture, irrigation, manufacturing, power, construction, transport, communication, social infrastructure, and services.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Regional Planning</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Since all the regions of India have not developed on the same lines, therefore, to reduce the regional imbalances, regional planning was introduced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Target Area Planning</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In order to reduce the regional and social disparities, the Planning Commission introduced the <b>‘target area’</b> and <b>‘target group’</b> approaches to planning.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the examples of <b>target area planning</b> directed towards the development of target areas are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Command Area Development Program;</p></li>
<li><p>Drought Prone Area Development Program;</p></li>
<li><p>Desert Development Program; and</p></li>
<li><p>Hill Area Development Program.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The examples of <b>target area planning</b> are &minus; the <b>Small Farmers Development Agency</b> (SFDA) and <b>Marginal Farmers Development Agency</b> (MFDA).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hill Area Development Programs</b> were initiated during the <b>Fifth Five Year</b> Plan. The plan covers 15 districts comprising all the hilly districts of Uttarakhand, Mikir Hill and North Cachar hills of Assam, Darjeeling district of West Bengal and Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu.</p></li>
<li><p>Major aims of Hill Area Development Program were harnessing the indigenous resources of the hilly areas through the development of horticulture, plantation agriculture, animal husbandry, poultry, forestry, and small-scale and village industry.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Drought Prone Area Program</b> was initiated during the <b>Fourth Five-Year Plan</b> with the objectives of providing employment to the people in droughtprone areas and creating productive assets.</p></li>
<li><p>The drought prone area in India largely covers semi-arid and arid tract of Rajasthan; Gujarat; Western Madhya Pradesh; <i>Marathwada</i> region of Maharashtra; <i>Rayalseema</i> and <i>Telangana</i> plateaus of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Telangana; Karnataka plateau; and highlands and interior parts of Tamil Nadu.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Planning Facts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 1967, the Planning Commission of India identified <b>67 districts</b> (entire or partly) of the country prone to drought.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1972, the Irrigation Commission introduced the criterion of 30% irrigated area and demarcated the drought prone areas.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1970s, the phrases such as <b><i>redistribution with growth</i></b> and <b><i>growth and equity</i></b> were incorporated in the definition of development.</p></li>
<li><p>Over period of time, the meaning of ‘Development’ did not remain restricted to ‘economic growth’ rather it also includes the issues such as improving the wellbeing and living standard of the people; availing the health facilities; education; equality of opportunity; and ensuring political and civil rights.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept of sustainable development emerged in the wake of general rise in the awareness of environmental issues in the late 1960s in the Western World.</p></li>
<li><p>The publication of ‘<b><i>The Population Bomb</i></b>’ by <b><i>Ehrlich</i></b> in 1968 and ‘<b><i>The Limits to Growth</i></b>’ by <b>Meadows</b> <i>at al</i> in 1972 further raised the environmental concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>The United Nations established a <i>World Commission on Environment</i> and <i>Development</i> (WCED) headed by the Norwegian Prime Minister <b>Gro Harlem Brundtland</b>. This is the reason that its report submitted in 1987 with the name ‘<b>Our Common Future</b>,’ is also known as <i>Brundtland</i> Report.</p></li>
<li><p>In this report, sustainable development is defined as &minus; <i>“development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”</i></p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, Sustainable development takes care of ecological, social, and economic aspects of the development during the present times and pleads for conservation of resources to enable the future generations to use these resources.</p></li>

</ul>
<img src="images/nepal_earthquake.jpg" alt="Nepal Earthquake" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Disasters are normally caused by nature (beyond human control); however, there are many human-induced disasters. For example, Bhopal Gas tragedy, Chernobyl nuclear disaster, wars, release of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons), releasing greenhouse gases, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides, some disasters are natural in occurence, but those are indirectly caused by human activities. For example, landslides in hilly regions, droughts, and floods due to deforestation and other environmental damage.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, Natural Hazards are the elements of circumstances in the Natural environment that have the potential to harm people or property or both.</p></li>
<li><p>The disasters are global in nature; hence, to combat with it, the United Nations made a systematic strategy at the World Conference on Disaster Management held in <b>May 1994</b> at <b>Yokohama, Japan</b>.</p></li>

<h1>Geography World - Introduction</h1>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The term geography was first coined by a Greek scholar <b><i>Eratosthenes</i></b>.</p></li>

<li><p>Geography is an interdisciplinary subject as well as it is a discipline of <i>‘<b>spatial synthesis</b>.’</i></p></li>
<li><p>Richard Hartshorne defines Geography as <i>“Geography is concerned with the description and explanation of the areal differentiation of the earth’s surface.”</i></p></li>

<li><p>The major approaches to study geography are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Systematic Approach and</li>
<li>Regional Approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The systematic approach was introduced by a German geographer <b>Alexander Von Humboldt</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the regional approach was also developed by a German geographer namely <b>Karl Ritter</b>; he was a contemporary of Humboldt.</p></li>
<li><p>In the systematic approach, first a phenomenon is studied world over as a whole, and then the identification of typologies or spatial patterns is done.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, in the regional approach, first the world is divided into regions at different hierarchical levels and then all the geographical phenomena in a particular region are studied.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the different approaches, geography is better known for its <b>dualistic</b> characteristics.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Branches of Geography</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Based on <b>systematic approach</b>, main branches of geography are &minus;</p>

<h1>Evolution of the Earth</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>There are dozens of hypotheses proposed regarding the origin of the earth by different philosophers.</p></li>
<li><p>However, one of the hypotheses namely <b><i>“Nebular Hypothesis”</i></b> given by Immanuel Kant and revised by Laplace became more popular.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Nebular Hypothesis, the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun.</p></li>
<li><p><b><i>Big Bang Theory</i></b>, which is also known as <b><i>expanding universe hypothesis</i></b> is the modern and the most accepted theory.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Edwin Hubble</b> was the first one who provided evidence that the universe is expanding, in 1920.</p></li>
<li><p>It is believed that the event of Big Bang took place about 13.7 billion years from now.</p></li>
</ul>
<a href="images/evolution_of_earth.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/evolution_of_earth.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Evolution of earth" /></a>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>According to the <b><i>Big Bang</i></b> theory (as shown in the image given below), the universe originated from an extremely dense and hot state and keeps expanding till date.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Galaxy</b> is a group of stars. Galaxies normally spread over vast distances, which are measured in thousands of light-years.</p></li>
<li><p>A galaxy starts to form by the accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called <b><i>nebula</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>One light year is the distance travelled by light in one year, which is equal to $9.46110^{12}km$.</p></li>
<li><p>Light travels at the speed of 300,000 km/second.</p></li>
<li><p>The mean distance between the sun and the earth is about 149,598,000 km. And, in terms of light years, it is 8.311 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Milky Way</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Our Solar system namely (part of <b><i>“Milky Way”</i></b> galaxy) consists of eight planets, the sun, 63 moons, millions of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets and huge quantity of dust-particles and gases.</p></li>
<li><p>The planets of Milky Way were formed about <b>4.6 billion</b> years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>The planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are called the <b>inner planets</b> as they lie between the sun and the belt of asteroids and the rest four planets i.e. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are known as <b>outer planets</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to this, the inner planets are also known as <b>“Terrestrial Planets,”</b> meaning earth-like as they are made up of rocks and metals, and have relatively high densities.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the outer planets are known as <b>“Jovian”</b> (Jupiter like) or Gas Giant Planets.</p></li>
<li><p>However, all the planets are formed in the same period i.e. about 4.6 billion years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>The terrestrial planets were formed in the closer to the parent star where it was too warm for gases to condense to solid particles, whereas Jovian planets were formed at quite a distant location from the parent star.</p></li>
<li><p>The solar wind was most intense nearer to the sun; so, it blew off lots of gas and dust from the terrestrial planets; however, the solar winds were not all that intense to cause similar removal of gases from the Jovian planets.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/milky_way.jpg" alt="Milky Way" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <b>moon</b> is the only natural satellite of the planet earth.</p></li>
<li><p>The earth has a layered structure and hence, from the surface to deeper depths (i.e. inner core), the earth has different zones/layers and each of these contains materials of different characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p>The present composition of the earth’s atmosphere is chiefly contributed by nitrogen and oxygen, as the primordial atmosphere with hydrogen and helium, is supposed to have been stripped off as a result of the solar winds.</p></li>
<li><p><b><i>Degassing</i></b> is the process through which the gases were outpoured from the interior of the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, continuous volcanic eruptions contributed water vapor and gases to the atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>The earth’s oceans were formed within 500 million years from the evolution of the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>About 3,800 million years ago, life began to evolve and the process of photosynthesis got evolved about 2,500-3,000 million years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Primarily, life remained confined to the oceans for a long time.</p></li>
<li><p>Oceans began to have the contribution of oxygen through the process of <b><i>photosynthesis</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Over a period of time, oceans were saturated with oxygen; however, about 2,000 million years ago, oxygen began to flood the atmosphere.</p></li>

<h1>Geography World - Climate</h1>
<h2>Koeppen’s Climate Classification</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The most widely used classification of climate is the climate classification scheme propounded by <b>V. Koeppen</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/world_climate.jpg" alt="World Climate" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of <b>vegetation</b> and <b>climate</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, he selected certain values of <b>temperature</b> and <b>precipitation</b> and related them with the distribution of vegetation and used the values for classifying the world climates.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, Koeppen’s world climate classification is based on <b>mean annual</b> and <b>mean monthly temperature</b> and <b>precipitation data</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Koeppen used symbolic (alphabetic) letters (i.e. use of capital and small letters) to designate climatic groups and types.</p></li>
<li><p>Koeppen broadly categorized <b>five</b> major climatic groups; four of them are based on temperature and one on precipitation.</p></li>

<h1>Geography World - Transport</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Trade or the exchange of commodities largely depends on transportation and communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Transport is a service or facility for the carriage of persons and goods from one place to the other using humans, animals, and other means of transport.</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation normally occurs through land, water, and air.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/world_transportation.jpg" alt="World Transportation" />
<h2>Roadways</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">

<h1>Geography World - Communications</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Communication through satellites has emerged as a new area in communication technology since the 1970s.</p></li>
<li><p>The first major breakthrough of the communication is the use of <b>optic fiber cables</b> (OFC) as it allows large quantities of data to be transmitted rapidly, securely, and are virtually error-free.</p></li>
<li><p>However, with the digitization of information in the 1990s, telecommunication slowly merged with the computers and constituted an integrated network termed as the <b>Internet</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, Internet is the largest electronic network on the planet connecting more than 1,000 million people in more than 100 countries of the world.</p></li>

<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Indian satellite <i>Aryabhatt</i> was launched on April 19, 1979, <i>Bhaskar</i>-I in 1979, and <i>Rohini</i> in 1980.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, on 18 June 1981, APPLE (Arian Passenger Payload Experiment) was launched through Arian rocket. Thereupon, a series of satellites have been launched for different purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cyberspace is the world of electronic computerized space. It consists of the Internet such on the World Wide Web (www).</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, the majority of the internet users in the world are living in U.S.A., U.K., Germany, Japan, China, and India.</p></li>
<li><p>Cyberspace has been expanding the contemporary economic and social space of humans through e-mail, e-commerce, e-learning and e-governance.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, these modern communication systems, more than transportation, have made the concept of global village a reality.</p></li>

<h1>Geography World - Population</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Roughly, 90 per cent of the world population lives in about 10 per cent of its land area.</p></li>
<li><p>The 10 most populous countries of the world contribute about 60 per cent to the world’s population.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/world_population.jpg" alt="World Population" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Out of the top ten most populous countries, 6 are located in Asia.</p></li>
<li><p>China is the most populous country of the world followed by India, the USA, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Russian Federation, and Japan.</p></li>
<li><p>The ratio between the number of people to the size of land is known as the <b>density</b> of population.</p></li>
<li><p>The density of Population is usually measured in persons per sq. km.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Factors Influencing Population Distribution</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Major factors that influence the distribution of population (i.e. density of population) are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Availability of water</p></li>
<li><p>Landforms</p></li>
<li><p>Climate</p></li>
<li><p>Soils</p></li>
<li><p>Availability of mineral resources</p></li>
<li><p>Urbanization</p></li>
<li><p>Industrialization</p></li>
<li><p>Social &amp; Cultural factors</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Change in Population</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The change in the number of inhabitants of a given territory during a specific period of time; this change may be either positive or negative.</p></li>
<li><p>The positive change in population is known as <b>population growth</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural Population Growth is the increased population, which is calculated by deducting total numbers of deaths from the total number of births in a particular region between two points of time.</p></li>
<li><p>The actual growth of population is calculated as &minus;</p>
<p><b>Births &minus; Deaths &plus; In Migration &minus; Out Migration.</b></p></li>
<li><p>Births, deaths, and migration are the three components of population change.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>Crude Birth Rate</b> (CBR) is expressed as number of live births in a year per thousand of the population.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Crude Death Rate</b> (CDR) is expressed in terms of deaths in a particular year per thousand of population in a particular region.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Migration</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>When people move from one place to another, the place they ‘move from’ is called the <b>Place of Origin</b> and the place they ‘move to’ is known as the <b>Place of Destination</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Migration may be permanent, temporary, or seasonal.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrants who move into a new place are known as <b>Immigrants</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrants who move out of a place are known as <b>Emigrants</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Population Growth</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>First time one billion population, world attains in 1830, the second billion population after 100 years (i.e. in 1930), the third billion population after 30 years (i.e. in 1960), the fourth billion population after 15 years (i.e. in1975), the fifth billion population after 12 years (i.e. in 1987), the sixth billion population after 12 years (i.e. in 1999), and the seven billion population again after 12 years (i.e. in 2011).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/world_population_growth.jpg" alt="Population Growth" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Industrial revolution along with fast technological advancement helped in the reduction of death rate and provided a stage for accelerated population growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally, developed countries take more time to increase their population than developing countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the African countries’ growth rate is much higher; annual population growth rate even more than 4%.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, many countries of the Eastern Europe including Russia, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, Portugal, Italy, etc. have negative population growth rate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following map shows the population <b>density</b> of the world population &minus;</p>
<img src="images/world_population_density.jpg" alt="Population Density" />
<h2>Demographic Transition Theory</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Demographic transition theory</b> describes population change of a given region; further, it explains that population changes from high births and high deaths to low births and low deaths, as the society progresses from rural, agrarian and illiterate to urban, industrial and literate society.</p></li>
<li><p>Demographic transition theory is explained in three stages as &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage I</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The first stage is the period of high fertility and high mortality, so most likely no population change or very low population growth.</p></li>
<li><p>In the first stage, people are largely engaged in agriculture (primary sector).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/demographic_transition.jpg" alt="Demographic Transition" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Further, in the first stage, life expectancy used to be low and people are mostly illiterate and have low levels of technology.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage II</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In the second stage, initially, fertility remains high, but over the period of time, it starts declining. On the other hand, mortality rate gets reduced because of the improvements in sanitation and health condition; likewise, population growth rate increases.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage III</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In the last stage, both the fertility and the mortality decline considerably; resultantly, the population is either stable or grows slowly (as shown in the graph given above).</p></li>
<li><p>In the last or III stage, the population becomes urbanized, literate, and has high technical knowhow and deliberately controls the family size.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1793, Thomas Malthus propounded a theory and stated that the number of people would increase faster than the food supply.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Population Composition</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The ratio between the number of women and men in the population is known as the <b>Sex Ratio</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The sex ratio is an important indicator about the status of women in a country.</p></li>
<li><p>Females have a biological advantage over males because they are more resilient than males.</p></li>
<li><p>The world population illustrates a sex ratio of 102 males per 100 females.</p></li>
<li><p>With record 85 males per 100 females, Latvia has the highest sex ratio in the world; on the other hand, in Qatar, there are 311 males per 100 females.</p></li>
<li><p>The sex ratio is favorable for females in (about) 139 countries of the world and unfavorable in rest of the countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Asia has a low sex ratio. For example, countries like China, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have a lower sex ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, many parts of Europe have greater sex ratio; probably because of better status of women in society and large number of males migrating to different parts of the world (in the past).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Age structure</b> of a country is an important indicator of population composition that represents the number of people of different age groups.</p></li>
<li><p>The age group of 15-59 indicates a large number of working population; the most productive age group.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, a greater proportion of population above 60 years represents an ageing population and they require more expenditure on health care facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, high proportion of young population of a country means &minus; the country has high birth rate and the population is youthful.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>age-sex structure</b> of a population refers to the number of females and males in different age groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Population Pyramid</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A <b>population pyramid</b> is used to study the age-sex structure of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>The shape of the population <b>pyramid</b> illustrates the characteristics of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>The following image illustrates the different shapes of pyramid that shows different compositions &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/population_pyramid.jpg" alt="Population Pyramid" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The left side illustrates the percentage of males; on the other hand, the right side shows the percentage of women in each age group.</p></li>
<li><p>In Western countries, males outnumber females in rural areas and females outnumber the males in urban areas. On the other hand, the countries like Nepal, Pakistan, and India have reverse case.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Geography World - Human Settlement</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Human settlements can be permanent or seasonal/temporary; rural or urban.</p></li>
<li><p>The process of people moving away from congested urban areas to cleaner areas outside the city in search of a better quality of living is known as <b>sub-urbanization</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/urban_settlement.jpg" alt="Urban settlement" />

<li><p>The settlements in which houses are constructed in a star shape is known as <b>Star like Pattern</b>. Such kind of settlements is found around the points where several roads cross each other (making star shape).</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements in which houses are constructed at the tri-junctions of the roads is known as <b>T-shaped Pattern</b>. Such kind of settlements is found along the road, which meets with another road at the dead end (the straight going road ends) and bifurcates left and right (<b>T</b>-Shape).</p></li>
<li><p>The settlement in which houses are constructed along the straight going road, which further bifurcates into two roads (similar to Y shape) is known as <b>Y-Shape pattern</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on shape, the settlements are classified as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b>Compact or Nucleated Settlements</b> &minus; Under such type of settlements, the houses are built very close to each other. Normally, plain fertile land regions have such compact or nucleated settlements.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dispersed Settlements</b> &minus; In such kind of settlements, houses are spaced far apart and often interspersed with fields; however, their market and some other activities are centralized where they participate together.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Planned settlements</b> are the settlements that planned and constructed by the government; governments provides shelter, water, and other infrastructures on acquired lands.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems of Rural Settlements</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Major problems of rural settlements are the lack of basic amenities (such as toilet facility, sanitation facility, health facilities, education facilities, etc.) and other infrastructure such as rail, road, tele-communications, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The first urban settlement that crossed one million mark was the city of <b>London</b> (around AD 1810) and by the end of 1982, approximately 175 cities in the world had crossed the one million population mark.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following image illustrates London in 1900 &minus;</p>

<h2>Classification of Urban Settlement</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Depending upon the functionality of the urban settlement, towns are classified as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Administrative Towns,</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial Towns,</p></li>
<li><p>Cultural Towns,</p></li>
<li><p>Recreational Towns, and</p></li>
<li><p>Industrial Towns.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The settlements that established for the administrative purpose or having largely administrative function are known as <b>administrative towns</b>. For example, such as Washington D.C., New Delhi, Canberra, Paris, Beijing, Addis Ababa, and London etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements that facilitate commercial opportunities are known as <b>trading and commercial towns</b>. For example, Agra, Lahore, Baghdad as an important transport node; Manchester and St Louis in land centers; Winnipeg and Kansas City as agricultural market towns; Frankfurt and Amsterdam as banking and financial centers; etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements established because of religious adherence are known as <b>cultural or religious</b> towns. For example, Jerusalem, Mecca, Jagannath Puri, Madurai, and Varanasi etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements established for the recreational purpose are known as <b>recreational towns</b>. For example, Miami, Panaji, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The settlements established because of industrial development are known as <b>industrial towns</b>. For example, Pittsburgh, Jamshedpur, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Facts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The name Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, indicates (as <i>Addis</i> means New and <i>Ababa</i> means Flower) as a <b>‘new’ city</b>, which was established in 1878.</p></li>
<li><p>Canberra was planned as the capital of Australia in 1912 by an American landscape architect, <b>Walter Burley Griffin</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/megalopolis.jpg" alt="Megalopolis" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Depending on the <b>size</b> and the <b>services</b> available and <b>functions</b> rendered, urban centers are categorized as <b>town, city, million city, conurbation</b> and <b>megalopolis</b> (shown in the image given above).</p></li>
<li><p>Town is the smallest point in the hierarchy of urban settlements; its population is comparatively greater than the village as well as its functionality is to serve as the market and other professional services to the villagers.</p></li>
<li><p>Cities are much larger than towns and have a greater number of economic functions.</p></li>
<li><p>The cities tend to have transport terminals, major financial institutions, and regional administrative offices.</p></li>
<li><p>The cities with a population of more than one million are known as <b>million cities</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The term <b>conurbation</b> was coined by Patrick Geddes in 1915 for a large area of urban development that resulted from the merging of two or more independent towns or cities. For example, Greater London, Manchester, Chicago, and Tokyo.</p></li>
<li><p>Used by Jean Gottman in 1957, <b>Megalopolis</b> is a Greek word meaning “great city.”</p></li>
<li><p>Megalopolis signifies ‘super-metropolitan’ region extending, as union of conurbations. For example, the urban landscape stretching from Boston in the north to south of Washington DC.</p></li>

<h1>Geography World - Human Development</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Growth and development both call for a change over a period of time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Development</b> means a qualitative change of positive value.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, development cannot take place unless there is an increment or addition to the existing conditions; therefore, development occurs when positive growth takes place.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/human_development.jpg" alt="Human Development" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>However, positive growth does not always lead to development, but rather development occurs when there is a positive change in the quality.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, if the population of a city grows from fifty thousand to hundred thousand over a period of time, we say the city has grown. However, along with the population, if basic facilities like housing, provision of basic services, and other characteristics also upgrade or improve, then this is known as the development.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Human Development</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The concept of human development was introduced by Dr Mahbub-ul-Haq.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr Haq described human development as development that broadens people’s choices and improves their lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, people are central to all development under this concept.</p></li>
<li><p>More popular as a man of vision and compassion, Pakistani economist <b>Dr. Mahbub-ul-Haq</b> created the Human Development Index in 1990.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Dr. Haq, development is all about enlarging people’s choices in order to lead long, healthy lives with dignity.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, the United Nations Development Program has adopted <b>Dr. Haq’s</b> concept of human development to publish the Human Development Report annually since 1990.</p></li>
<li><p>Leading a long and healthy life, being able to gain knowledge, and having enough means to be able to live a decent life are the most important aspects of the human development.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea of human development is supported by the concepts of <b>equity, sustainability, productivity,</b> and <b>empowerment</b>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Equity</b> refers to making equal access to opportunities for everybody.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sustainability</b> means continuity in the availability of opportunities, which means, to have sustainable human development, each generation must have the same opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>All environmental, financial, and human resources must be used keeping in mind the future that misuse of any of these resources will lead to fewer opportunities for the future generations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Productivity</b>, used here means - human work; such productivity must be constantly enriched by building capabilities in people.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Empowerment</b>, used here means - to have the power to make choices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Human Development Index</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <b>human development index</b> illustrates what has been achieved in the key areas of human development.</p></li>
<li><p>The Human Development index and the Human Poverty index are the two important indices to measure human development used by the UNDP.</p></li>
<li><p>Bhutan is the only country in the world that officially proclaims the <b>Gross National Happiness</b> (GNH) as the measure of its progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The following maps show countries with their HDI and GDP through respective color (category) &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/world_hdi.jpg" alt="HDI and GDP" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The countries that score more than 0.793, are kept under the category of <b>very high</b> human development index (shown in above in the blue color).</p></li>
<li><p>The countries that score between 0.698 and 0.793, are kept under the category of <b>high</b> human development index.</p></li>
<li><p>The countries that score between less than 0.522, are kept under the category of <b>low</b> human development index.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the political environment of the country and the level of freedom people have is also an important criteria to major human development.</p></li>

<h1>Geography World - International Trade</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Trade simply means the voluntary exchange of goods and services, where two or more parties are involved.</p></li>
<li><p>In the present world, trades are <b>international</b> and <b>national</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/international_trade.jpg" alt="International Trade" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>International trade is the exchange of goods and services among countries across national borders.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Barter system</b> was an initial form of trade practiced by the primitive societies.</p></li>
<li><p>In the barter system, goods were exchanged directly (no money were required).</p></li>
<li><p>Jon Beel Mela, which takes place in Jagiroad, 35 km away from Guwahati in the month of January every year (after the harvest season) possibly, it is the only fair in India, where barter system is still practiced.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>Silk Route</b> is an early example of long distance trade connecting Rome to China – travelling about the 6,000 km route.</p></li>
<li><p>During the medieval period, the sea route was discovered.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifteenth century onwards, the European colonialism began <b>‘slave trade’</b> a new form of trade of human beings.</p></li>
<li><p>The slave trade was pretty popular and a lucrative business for more than two hundred years; however, over a period of time, it was abolished - first in Denmark in 1792, and then Great Britain in 1807, and the United States in 1808.</p></li>
<li><p>During the World Wars I and II, countries practicing international trade imposed trade taxes and quantitative restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>However, after the war period, organizations like <b>General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade</b> i.e. GATT (which later became the <b>World Trade Organization</b> i.e. WTO), helped in reducing these tariffs imposed on trade of goods and services.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/wto.jpg" alt="WTO" />
<h2>Factors of International Trade</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Major factors of international trade are &minus;
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>The difference in national resources,</li>
<li>Population aspects,</li>
<li>Stage of economic development,</li>
<li>The extent of foreign investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Facts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Other infrastructure availability (including transportation and technological factors).</p></li>
<li><p>The total value of goods and services traded in a given period of time is known as the <b>volume of trade</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>balance of trade</b> is calculated by taking the difference of the goods and services imported and exported by a country to other countries in a given period of time (normally, in one financial year).</p></li>
<li><p>If the value of imports is greater than the value of a country’s exports, the country has a negative or unfavorable balance of trade.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if the value of exports is greater than the value of imports, then the country has a positive or favorable balance of trade.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Bilateral</b> and <b>Multilateral</b> are the two major types of international trade.</p></li>
<li><p>Bilateral trade is practiced between two countries on their personal terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Multilateral trade is practiced among many nations (one country can trade with many countries); and, as per the WTO agreement, every WTO member country has to follow the MFN Principle (Most Favored Nation).</p></li>
<li><p>The MFN principle restrains the discrimination trade rules and promotes a uniform trading rule with every member country.</p></li>
<li><p>The act of opening up economies by removing trade barriers for trading purpose is known as <b>free trade</b> or <b>trade liberalization</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of selling a commodity in two or more countries at a price that differs for reasons not related to costs is called <b>dumping</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, some countries also need to be cautious about dumped goods; because along with free trade, dumped goods (of cheaper prices) can harm the domestic producers.</p></li>
<li><p>After World War II (1948), some of the developed countries founded an international organization namely <b>General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade</b> (GATT).</p></li>
<li><p>However, from January 1, 1995, GATT was transformed into the <b>World Trade Organization</b> (WTO).</p></li>
<li><p>WTO sets the rules for the global trading system and resolves disputes if any arises between its member nations.</p></li>
<li><p>Headquarters of WTO is located in <b>Geneva</b>, Switzerland.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides, some <b>Regional Trade Blocs</b> have also formed in order to encourage trade between countries who are located in geographical proximity, similarity, and complementarities in trading items.</p></li>
<li><p>The major purpose of regional trade blocks is to curb restrictions on trade of the developing world.</p></li>
<li><p>For examples, <b>ASEAN</b> (Association of South East Asian Nations), <b>CIS</b> (Commonwealth of Independent States), <b>NAFTA</b> (North American Free Trade Association), <b>OPEC</b> (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The chief gateways of the world of international trade are the harbors and ports.</p></li>
<li><p>The ports provide facilities of docking, loading, unloading, and the storage facilities for cargo.</p></li>
<li><p>The port specialized in bulk cargo-like grain, sugar, ore, oil, chemicals, and similar materials is known as an <b>industrial port</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The port that handles general cargo-packaged products and manufactured goods is known as a <b>commercial port</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The port, which is located away from the sea coast is known as an <b>inland port</b>. For example, Manchester port, Kolkata port, Memphis port, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The port, which is located away from the actual ports into the deep water is known as an <b>out port</b>. For example, for example, Athens and its out port Piraeus in Greece.</p></li>
<li><p>The port which is originally developed as calling point on main sea routes where ships used to anchor for refueling, watering, and taking food items is known as a <b>port of call</b>. For example, Aden, Honolulu, and Singapore.</p></li>
<li><p>The port, which is used as the collection center i.e. the goods are brought from different centers (or countries) for export is known as an <b>entrepot port</b>. For example, Rotterdam for Europe, and Copenhagen for the Baltic region.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following map illustrates the major seaports of the world &minus;</p>
<img src="images/world_major_seaports.jpg" alt="Major Seaports" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The port that serves the warships and has repair workshops for them is known as a <b>naval port</b>. For example, Kochi and Karwar in India.</p></li>
<li><p>The port that exclusively concerned with the transportation of passengers and mail across water bodies (covering short distances) is known as a <b>ferry port</b>.</p></li>
