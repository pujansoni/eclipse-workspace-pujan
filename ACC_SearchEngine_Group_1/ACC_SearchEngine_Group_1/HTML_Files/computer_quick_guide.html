<h1>Computer - Overview</h1>
<p>Today’s world is an information-rich world and it has become a necessity for everyone to know about computers. A computer is an electronic data processing device, which accepts and stores data input, processes the data input, and generates the output in a required format.</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to Computers and its fundamentals.</p>
<h2>Functionalities of a Computer</h2>
<p>If we look at it in a very broad sense, any digital computer carries out the following five functions &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Takes data as input.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Stores the data/instructions in its memory and uses them as required.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Processes the data and converts it into useful information.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Generates the output.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Controls all the above four steps.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/computer.jpg" alt="Computer" />

<h2>PC (Personal Computer)</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/personal_computer.jpg" alt="Personal Computer" />
<p>A PC can be defined as a small, relatively inexpensive computer designed for an individual user. PCs are based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip. Businesses use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and database management applications. At home, the most popular use for personal computers is playing games and surfing the Internet.</p>
<p>Although personal computers are designed as single-user systems, these systems are normally linked together to form a network. In terms of power, now-a-days high-end models of the Macintosh and PC offer the same computing power and graphics capability as low-end workstations by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.</p>
<h2>Workstation</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/work_stations.jpg" alt="Work Stations" />
<p>Workstation is a computer used for engineering applications (CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, software development, and other such types of applications which require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high quality graphics capabilities.</p>
<p>Workstations generally come with a large, high-resolution graphics screen, large amount of RAM, inbuilt network support, and a graphical user interface. Most workstations also have mass storage device such as a disk drive, but a special type of workstation, called diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive.</p>
<p>Common operating systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like PC, workstations are also single-user computers like PC but are typically linked together to form a local-area network, although they can also be used as stand-alone systems.</p>
<h2>Minicomputer</h2>
<p>It is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting up to 250 users simultaneously.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/mini_computer.jpg" alt="Mini Computer" />
<h2>Mainframe</h2>
<p>Mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously. Mainframe executes many programs concurrently and supports many simultaneous execution of programs.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/main_frame.jpg" alt="Main Frame" />
<h2>Supercomputer</h2>
<p>Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently available. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense amount of mathematical calculations (number crunching).</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/supercomputer.jpg" alt="Super Computer" />
<p>For example, weather forecasting, scientific simulations, (animated) graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological data (e.g. in petrochemical prospecting).</p>

<h1>Computer - Memory</h1>
<p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. The memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells. Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one. For example, if the computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory locations. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>Memory is primarily of three types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache Memory</li>
<li>Primary Memory/Main Memory</li>
<li>Secondary Memory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cache Memory</h2>
<p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU. The parts of data and programs are transferred from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/cache_memory.jpg" alt="Cache Memory" />
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>The advantages of cache memory are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li>
<li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li>
<li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li>
<li>It stores data for temporary use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<p>The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li>
<li>It is very expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</h2>
<p>Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. The data and instruction required to be processed resides in the main memory. It is divided into two subcategories RAM and ROM.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/primary_memory.jpg" alt="Primary Memory" />
<h3>Characteristics of Main Memory</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>These are semiconductor memories.</li>
<li>It is known as the main memory.</li>
<li>Usually volatile memory.</li>
<li>Data is lost in case power is switched off.</li>
<li>It is the working memory of the computer.</li>
<li>Faster than secondary memories.</li>
<li>A computer cannot run without the primary memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secondary Memory</h2>
<p>This type of memory is also known as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than the main memory. These are used for storing data/information permanently. CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines. The contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it. For example, disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/secondary_memory.jpg" alt="Secondar Memory" />
<h3>Characteristics of Secondary Memory</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>These are magnetic and optical memories.</li>
<li>It is known as the backup memory.</li>
<li>It is a non-volatile memory.</li>
<li>Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off.</li>
<li>It is used for storage of data in a computer.</li>
<li>Computer may run without the secondary memory.</li>
<li>Slower than primary memories.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Random Access Memory</h1>
<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.</p>
<img class="raligned" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/primary_memory.jpg" alt="Primary Memory" />
<p>Access time in RAM is independent of the address, that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and takes the same amount of time. Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive.</p>
<p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</p>
<p>RAM is of two types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li>
<li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Static RAM (SRAM)</h2>
<p>The word <b>static</b> indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not be refreshed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is extra space in the matrix, hence SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space, making the manufacturing costs higher. SRAM is thus used as cache memory and has very fast access.</p>
<h3>Characteristic of Static RAM</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Long life</li>
<li>No need to refresh</li>
<li>Faster</li>
<li>Used as cache memory</li>
<li>Large size</li>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>High power consumption</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</h2>
<p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually <b>refreshed</b> in order to maintain the data. This is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory as it is cheap and small. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Dynamic RAM</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Short data lifetime</li>
<li>Needs to be refreshed continuously</li>
<li>Slower as compared to SRAM</li>
<li>Used as RAM</li>
<li>Smaller in size</li>
<li>Less expensive</li>
<li>Less power consumption</li>
</ul>
<h1>Computer - Read Only Memory</h1>
<p>ROM stands for <b>Read Only Memory</b>. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer. This operation is referred to as <b>bootstrap</b>. ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/rom.jpg" alt="ROM" />
<p>Let us now discuss the various types of ROMs and their characteristics.</p>
<h2>MROM (Masked ROM)</h2>
<p>The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs, which are inexpensive.</p>
<h2>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p>
<h2>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region. The charge is retained for more than 10 years because the charge has no leakage path. For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use, the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.</p>
<h2>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h2>
<p>EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times. Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence, the process of reprogramming is flexible but slow.</p>
<h2>Advantages of ROM</h2>
<p>The advantages of ROM are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Non-volatile in nature</li>
<li>Cannot be accidentally changed</li>
<li>Cheaper than RAMs</li>
<li>Easy to test</li>
<li>More reliable than RAMs</li>
<li>Static and do not require refreshing</li>
<li>Contents are always known and can be verified</li>
</ul>

<li>Shortcut method - Binary to Octal</li>
<li>Shortcut method - Octal to Binary</li>
<li>Shortcut method - Binary to Hexadecimal</li>
<li>Shortcut method - Hexadecimal to Binary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decimal to Other Base System</h2>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Get the remainder from Step 1 as the rightmost digit (least significant digit) of the new base number.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Record the remainder from Step 3 as the next digit (to the left) of the new base number.</p>
<p>Repeat Steps 3 and 4, getting remainders from right to left, until the quotient becomes zero in Step 3.</p>
<p>The last remainder thus obtained will be the Most Significant Digit (MSD) of the new base number.</p>

<h1>Computer - Data and Information</h1>
<p><b>Data</b> can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine.</p>
<p>Data is represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+,-,/,*,&lt;,&gt;,= etc.)</p>
<h2>What is Information?</h2>
<p><b>Information</b> is organized or classified data, which has some meaningful values for the receiver. Information is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based.</p>
<p>For the decision to be meaningful, the processed data must qualify for the following characteristics &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Timely</b> &minus; Information should be available when required.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Accuracy</b> &minus; Information should be accurate.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Completeness</b> &minus; Information should be complete.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/computer_data_processing.jpg" alt="Computer Data Processing" />
<h2>Data Processing Cycle</h2>
<p>Data processing is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machine to increase their usefulness and add values for a particular purpose. Data processing consists of the following basic steps - input, processing, and output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/computer_data.jpg" alt="Computer Data" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Input</b> &minus; In this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. The form will depend on the processing machine. For example, when electronic computers are used, the input data can be recorded on any one of the several types of input medium, such as magnetic disks, tapes, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Processing</b> &minus; In this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form. For example, pay-checks can be calculated from the time cards, or a summary of sales for the month can be calculated from the sales orders.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Output</b> &minus; At this stage, the result of the proceeding processing step is collected. The particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data. For example, output data may be pay-checks for employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Computer - Networking</h1>
<p>A <b>computer network</b> is a system in which multiple computers are connected to each other to share information and resources.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/computer_networks.jpg" alt="Computer Networks"/>
<h2>Characteristics of a Computer Network</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Share resources from one computer to another.</p></li>
<li><p>Create files and store them in one computer, access those files from the other computer(s) connected over the network.</p></li>

<h1>Computer - Internet and Intranet</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will see what is Internet and Intranet, as well as discuss the similarities and differences between the two.</p>
<h2>Internet</h2>
<p>It is a worldwide/global system of interconnected computer networks. It uses the standard Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Every computer in Internet is identified by a unique IP address. IP Address is a unique set of numbers (such as 110.22.33.114) which identifies a computer’s location.</p>
<p>A special computer DNS (Domain Name Server) is used to provide a name to the IP Address so that the user can locate a computer by a name. For example, a DNS server will resolve a name <a target="_blank" rel="follow" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/">https://www.tutorialspoint.com</a> to a particular IP address to uniquely identify the computer on which this website is hosted.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/internet.jpg" alt="Internet" />
<p>Internet is accessible to every user all over the world.</p>
<h2>Intranet</h2>
<p>Intranet is the system in which multiple PCs are connected to each other. PCs in intranet are not available to the world outside the intranet. Usually each organization has its own Intranet network and members/employees of that organization can access the computers in their intranet.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/intranet.jpg" alt="Intranet" />
<p>Each computer in Intranet is also identified by an IP Address which is unique among the computers in that Intranet.</p>
<h2>Similarities between Internet and Intranet</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Intranet uses the internet protocols such as TCP/IP and FTP.</p></li>
<li><p>Intranet sites are accessible via the web browser in a similar way as websites in the internet. However, only members of Intranet network can access intranet hosted sites.</p></li>
<li><p>In Intranet, own instant messengers can be used as similar to yahoo messenger/gtalk over the internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Differences between Internet and Intranet</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Internet is general to PCs all over the world whereas Intranet is specific to few PCs.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet provides a wider and better access to websites to a large population, whereas Intranet is restricted.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet is not as safe as Intranet. Intranet can be safely privatized as per the need.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>How to Buy a Computer?</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will supply relevant information to help you buy a desktop on component by component basis. As desktops are highly customizable, so it is better to learn about the main parts and then visit the manufacturer or the retailer shop or site, instead of just looking at some specific model directly.</p>
<p>Popular desktop brands are Dell, Lenovo, HP and Apple. Always compare the desktops based on their specifications and base price.</p>
<h2>Monitor</h2>
<img class="raligned" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/images/flat_monitor.jpg" alt="Flat Monitor" />
