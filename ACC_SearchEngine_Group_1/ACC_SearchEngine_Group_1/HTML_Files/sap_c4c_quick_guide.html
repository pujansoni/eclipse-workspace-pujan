<h1>SAP C4C - Architecture</h1>
<p>SAP C4C provides prepacked integration for SAP ECC, CRM and Outlook. It consists of HTML5 UI, Silverlight UI, and mobile Apps for IOS, Android platform and HANA for HANA Cloud integration HCI.</p>
<p>SAP C4C has multitenant architecture where solution and components is shared between multiple customers. There is an option to go for single tenant by paying additional cost. In a multiple tenant environment, all the updates and releases are built on C4C custom solutions for multiple clients.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/sap_c4c_architecture.jpg" alt="SAP C4C Architecture" />
<p>SAP C4C solution can be easily integrated with SAP ERP and CRM on premise solution. There are two ways of integration &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>SAP Process Integration PI/PO</b> &minus; This integration is recommended when you are already using process integration for on premise systems.</p></li>
<li><p><b>SAP HANA Cloud Integration HCI</b> &minus; This integration is recommended when you have to perform cloud-to-cloud integration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The C4C integration to CRM on-premise could be on the basis of &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Level of customization required</li>
<li>Whether the functionality is required to be on the cloud/on the field</li>
<li>The master data governance rules within the company</li>
<li>Sales organization structure, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The frontline sales team will generate opportunities on the move with minimal information. The Top 5 - Customer, Product, Opportunity Phase, Value, Volume and the sales assistants in the back-office will enhance the opportunities with more data that are replicated to the on-premise solution.</p>
<p>The C4C integration to ERP could be on the basis of types of transactions needed to be displayed to the front end sales like orders, quotations or contracts. It is based on the role of the sales person whether they need pricing information, availability checks or even customer credit information. The principle here could be that of only deploying a "Must Have" integration with the ERP transactions.</p>
<h1>SAP C4C - Public vs Private</h1>
<p>When a customer goes for SAP C4C production tenant, there is a test tenant provided as free to the customer. A separate unique URL is provided for each tenant. A customer can also purchase permanent test tenant subscription.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/sap_c4c_public_vs_private.jpg" alt="SAP C4C Public vs Private" />
<p>SAP C4C solution is hosted on cloud tenant that has many customers. This is called a <b>public tenant</b>.</p>
<p>C4C customers can also go for private purchase edition, which allows them to subscribe for a tenant with no other customer on it. SAP C4C production and test tenants are always of separate system. A customer cannot purchase a permanent test tenant for temporary basis. It is recommended only when SDK solution is in use.</p>
<p>SAP Cloud hosting cannot differentiate between a permanent and a temporary test tenant. It only supports up to two test tenants irrespective of which a customer can consider as temporary tenant and a permanent tenant.</p>
<p>Using a test and production tenant, a project can be implemented in the following way as demonstrated in the figure &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/test_and_production_tenant.jpg" alt="Test and Production Tenant" />
<p>SAP C4C administrator can manage the test and production tenants using Service Control Center &rarr; System View</p>

<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/systems.jpg" alt="Systems" />
<p>From the dropdown list, you can select Active systems, decommission system, or all systems and click on Go.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/active_systems.jpg" alt="Active Systems" />
<p>You can use request creation option to request a new system. Different options can be selected for requesting a new system like &minus;</p>

<li>Copy of Source System</li>
<li>Initial System (Copy Solution Profile)</li>
<li>Copy of Source System</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP C4C - User Interface</h1>
<p>In SAP C4C system we have two types of UIs. In this chapter, we will discuss in detail the UIs of SAP C4C.</p>
<h2>HTML 5</h2>
<p>SAP C4C is used by end-users. This is considered as light version and provides fast and easy access to different work centers suitable for the end-users in C4C environment.</p>
<p>The user interface framework for SAP C4C for end-users is based on HTML 5. All business user features and functions are available in HTML 5. Most of the administrator features and functions are still only available in Silverlight.</p>
<p>To access HTML 5-SAP C4C user interface, open Internet Explorer and type your tenant URL &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/html_5_sap_c4c.jpg" alt="HTML_5_SAP_C4C" />
<p>Enter the user name and password and select the language. Click <b>Log on</b>.</p>
<p>You will land on HTML 5-C4C user interface.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/html_5_sap_c4c_user_interface.jpg" alt="HTML SAP_C4C User Interface" />
<h2>Silverlight</h2>
<p>This C4C-Silverlight user interface is used by Administrator. For this, you need to install Microsoft Silverlight in your local system.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The default client is HTML5 but C4C administrators can launch the Silverlight UI from the Adaptation menu to access the configuration relevant work centers.</p>

<h1>SAP C4C - Adaptation</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn Customization, done by C4C administrators in Silverlight UI screen. An administrator can restrict an end-user to personalize his/her screen and can personalize for all the users. This process is called <b>Adaptation</b>.</p>
<p>Adaptation refers to a set of tool, the administrators can use to add or modify fields, change master screen layouts, assign screen layouts to specific roles, restrict dropdown list values, and modify output forms. You can also migrate adaptation changes from one system to another C4C system.</p>
<p>The screen adaptation feature allows changes to the fields and screens that is displayed to all users in Cloud for Customer environment. This is an important feature. In case there is some critical business data that has to be captured, this feature can be used to show on the screens of all the users.</p>
<p>The following steps will guide you through the process of adaptation.</p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>To perform Adaption in Silverlight UI, go to <b>Adapt</b> &rarr; <b>Company Settings</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/adapt_company_settings.jpg" alt="Adapt Company Settings" />
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Click the <b>General</b> tab. You can restrict individual users to personalize their screens. To restrict, select checkbox <b>Disable User Personalization Features</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/general_tab.jpg" alt="General Tab" />
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Click the tab Theme. You can select the theme from drop down options and the theme that you will select will automatically reflect in all user profiles in the C4C environment.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_c4c/images/tab_theme.jpg" alt="Tab Theme" />
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Click Auto logoff. Under this tab, you can define the auto log off period from the drop down list when a user is inactive. For security reasons, users are automatically logged off from the system if they have been inactive in the system for a certain period of time.

<h2>C4C Adaption – Extension Fields</h2>
<p>Extension fields are additional fields that the administrators can add to the solution in order to meet a specific business requirement. If applicable, these features add new field to the end of the data migration worksheet.</p>
<p>When you first create an extension field, you navigate to a screen on which you want it to appear and add it to a section of the screen. Each screen section is based on an underlying business context. The business context typically corresponds to a part of a business document or other object. For example, the header data of sales quote. The business context is used to determine which other screens you can add the field to. In addition, it is also used to determine the form templates, analytical data sources and reports, enterprise search categories, and extension scenarios that the field can be added to.</p>
<p>To add a new field, first you need to navigate to the relevant screen and enter Adaptation mode via Adapt &rarr; Edit Master Layout. The area of the screen is where the new field should be created, i.e., in the account details area.</p>

<h1>SAP C4C - Reporting</h1>
<p>In SAP C4C, analytics data in the cloud solution is real time and there is no persistency in a separate Business Warehouse layer.</p>
<p>SAP C4C supports the following types of reporting.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Standard reports</b> &minus; These are standard reports that are provided with C4C solution.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Custom reports</b> &minus; This includes custom reports in C4C that are created as per business requirement.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Interactive Dashboards</b> &minus; These are user-interactive dashboards that are created separately.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP C4C – Standard Reports</h2>
<p>The reporting feature is integrated in C4C solution that allows you to support business processes and to check performance as per business KPIs. This helps you to make decisions with real time data.</p>
<h3>Report Analysis and Integration</h3>
<p>In C4C Cloud solution, you can insert data from reports into Microsoft Excel document. You can use logon to C4C environment on the ribbon and you can directly refresh the data in excel document including all subsequent activities in Cloud for customer environment.</p>
<p>To modify reports so that those changes apply to all users, you can make the change as an administrator by creating a new view or copy of a report via Business Analytics.</p>
<p>SAP C4C supports the following features in analytics &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Microsoft Excel based analysis and formatting of reports</li>
<li>Drilldown on iPad</li>
<li>Mark reports as favorites</li>
<li>Enable reports on smart devices</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP C4C – Custom Reports</h2>
<p>In SAP C4C, you can create custom reports based on custom fields in your solution and these custom fields can be added to data sources or reports.</p>
<p>You can join or combine heterogeneous data sources that are created in C4C environment or those that are delivered with the solution, as well as create custom calculated measures and comparison metrics.</p>
<h2>Data Sources for Report Creation</h2>
<p>The first step is in the report creation process through the Report wizard is to select a data source. In SAP C4C, various pre-defined data sources are provided with the solution. You can also create and edit your own data sources to suit your business requirements and processes and use your data sources for reporting.</p>
<p>To create your data sources, you can combine or join data sources to merge data into a new data source. You can also create a cloud data source by importing outside information.</p>
<h2>Important Terms in Reporting</h2>
<p>Following are the key terms used in reporting in SAP C4C &minus;</p>
<h3>Key Figures</h3>
<p>Key figures are defined as key performance indicators in the report. You can also refine the data appearing in key figures by setting up restricted or calculated key figures.</p>
<p>You can define a restricted key figure as key figure restricted to a specified characteristic value and is often created for comparison metrics.</p>
<p>In C4C reporting, a calculated key figure is defined as the key figure that contains some calculation rules or formulas. A calculated key figure can be created from existing key figures in the selected data source.</p>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>These are assigned to restricted key figures and to add additional behavior you can define properties of the characteristics.</p>
<h3>Work Centers</h3>
<p>You should assign the reports to work centers to make them available to users.</p>
<h3>Assigning Reports to Roles</h3>
<p>You can also enable the assignment of reports to business roles when you implement a new project under fine tuning option. This allows you to assign reports to business roles directly and hence restricts by role which users can view the reports that are assigned in work center. To enable this: You can go to Administrator &rarr; Analytics &rarr; Settings</p>
<h3>Report Views</h3>
<p>When you assign a report to the work center, you can create views, which appear in enduser report list. A view can be created by choosing key figures and characteristics for columns and rows in a table, then selecting a chart type to best represent that data.</p>
<p>When you create a view, you can also define conditions and exceptions for key figures that alter how your data is presented based on rules and thresholds.</p>
<h1>SAP C4C - Creating a Custom Report</h1>

<p>Joined Data Sources allows you to merge the data between two or more data sources and merging results the matching of data.</p>
<h1>SAP C4C - Service Level</h1>
<p>In SAP Cloud for Customer, service level defines the time when a ticket for a customer must be responded and completed. Service levels help the organizations define objectives for handling customer messages. Using these, you can measure the performance and the quality of your customer service.</p>
<p>Service levels also help to define new rules as per the ticket category and description whenever a new customer message comes in the C4C system. Using service levels, a system can determine the service level based on those rules, and then based on that service level, the initial response and completion due time points are calculated.</p>
<h2>Create a Service Level</h2>

<p>This is a time-saving and an easy way to cope with a large number of users.</p>
<h1>SAP C4C - Work Distribution</h1>
<p>In SAP C4C, work distribution is used to route the tickets to particular teams or agent queues. By default, all incoming customer service tickets are visible to all business users with the corresponding access rights.</p>
<p><b>Organizational Work Distribution and Employee Work Distribution</b> enable you to manage the distribution of customer tickets within your service organization. You create rules that allow the system to evaluate the tickets and distribute them to the responsible team or the responsible processing agent.</p>
<p>You can manage the distribution of work within your organization by creating work distribution rules that allow the system to evaluate work items and to determine the organization unit responsible for these work items. Depending on the work category, the system directs the work items to the determined organization unit, or provides the organization unit as a proposal in the relevant business document.</p>
<p>For each work category listed below, you can create one or more rules. If you do not create any rules for a given work category, all corresponding work items are subject to the global work assignment. You can find additional details about each work category in the related document in the Help Center.</p>
<h2>Create Work Distribution</h2>
<p>Following are the steps to perform work distribution.</p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>To perform work distribution, go to Administration &rarr; Organization Work Distribution</p>
