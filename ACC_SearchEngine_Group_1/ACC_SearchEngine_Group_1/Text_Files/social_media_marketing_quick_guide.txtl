Each campaign can feature multiple ad sets, each of which has its own budget and schedule. We can also organize each ad set to represent a particular audience segment, for example, we can have an ad set for people who live near our store. This will help us control the amount we spend on each audience, decide when they will see our ads, and measure their response.

Pinterest is a dynamic social media platform for sharing favorite images, videos, fun media, etc. It can be termed as a visual bookmarking tool. Using Pinterest, you can connect with other like-minded people by sharing your hobbies and interests through online bulletin boards. Pinterest taps into a very fundamental human behavior – the desire to collect things (even if they may not be of any apparent value). History of Pinterest Ben Silbermann is an American Internet entrepreneur who co-founded Pinterest. He is also the CEO of Pinterest. Silbermann says that the genesis of Pinterest really came from his love of collecting as a kid. “Collecting tells a lot about who you are,” he said, and when they looked at the web, “there wasn’t a place to share that side of who you were.” Pinterest – Interesting Facts Pinterest is now the fourth largest driver of website traffic. Globally, the site is most popular with women. In terms of age distribution, the Pinterest demography closely resembles the U.S. Internet population. According to Hitwise data, by December 2011, the site had become one of the top 10 largest social network services, with 11 million total visits per week, driving more referral traffic to retailers than LinkedIn, YouTube, and Google+. The average purchase generated by Pinterest is double the amount of those started on Facebook or Twitter. 80% of pins are repins as opposed to about 5% Tweets that are ReTweets. How it Works? Pinterest is a free website that requires a valid registration. You can create either a free personal account or a business account as per your requirement. Users can upload, save, sort, and manage images known as pins and other media content (e.g., videos and images) through collections known as pinboards. Pinterest acts as a personalized media platform. Users can browse the content of others in their feed. Users can then save individual pins to one of their own boards using the "Pin-It" button, with Pinboards typically organized by a central topic or theme. Users can also personalize their experience with Pinterest by pinning items, creating boards, and interacting with other members. By doing so, the users "pin feed" displays unique, personalized results. Content can also be found outside of Pinterest and similarly uploaded to a board via the "Pin-It" button, which can be downloaded to the bookmark bar on a web browser, or be implemented by a webmaster directly on the website. They also have the option of sending a pin to other Pinterest users and email accounts through the "Send" button. When you login to your Pinterest account, you will be seeing your home feed.
