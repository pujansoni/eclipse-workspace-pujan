It is designed for computers, smartphones, and network servers. The system is developed by a UK based company called Canonical Ltd. All the principles used to develop the Ubuntu software are based on the principles of Open Source software development. Features of Ubuntu Following are some of the significant features of Ubuntu ? The desktop version of Ubuntu supports all the normal software on Windows such as Firefox, Chrome, VLC, etc. It supports the office suite called LibreOffice. Ubuntu has an in-built email software called Thunderbird, which gives the user access to email such as Exchange, Gmail, Hotmail, etc. There are a host of free applications for users to view and edit photos. There are also applications to manage videos and it also allows the users to share videos. It is easy to find content on Ubuntu with the smart searching facility. The best feature is, it is a free operating system and is backed by a huge open source community. Release Cycle of Ubuntu Every year there are 2 releases of Ubuntu, one in April and one in October, from Canonical. The version number normally denotes the year in which the software was released. For example, version 14.04 specifies that it was released in the year 2014 and in the month of April. Similarly, the version 16.04 specifies that it was released in the year 2016 and in the month of April. The April build every year is the more stable build, while the October build does a lot of experimentation on new features. The official site for Ubuntu is https://www.ubuntu.com/ The site has all information and documentation about the Ubuntu Software. It also has the download links for both the server and desktop versions of Ubuntu. Ubuntu - Flavors Ubuntu comes in a variety of flavors. In this chapter, we will discuss briefly about some of the popular flavors of Ubuntu. Ubuntu Desktop This is the operating system which can be used by regular users. This comes pre-built with software that help the users perform usual basic activities. Operations such as browsing, email and multimedia are also available in this edition. The latest version as of September 2016 is 16.04.01. Ubuntu Server The server version is used for hosting applications such as web servers and databases. Each server version is supported by Ubuntu for 5 years. These operating systems have support for cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. The latest version as of September 2016 is 16.04.1. Kubuntu The normal Ubuntu interface is based on a software called Unity. However, Kubuntu is based on a software called KDE Plasma desktop. This gives a different look and feel to the Ubuntu software. Kubuntu has the same features and software availability as Ubuntu. The official site for Kubuntu is https://www.kubuntu.org/ Linux Mint This is also based of the Ubuntu operating system. It comes pre-built with a lot of applications for the modern user in the space of photos and multimedia. This operating system is completely based on the open source community.

Ubuntu - Secure Shell The Secure Shell (SSH) in Linux is used to log into the machine in an encrypted and safe manner. This helps in providing a secure channel to streamline all requests to the Ubuntu server. SSH uses cryptographic keys to log into the server. On Windows, the most common tool to perform a secure shell to a Linux server is putty. In this chapter, we will learn how to use putty to Secure Shell into a server. Step 1 ? Download putty from the http://www.putty.org/ site. Step 2 ? Before connecting to use putty, we need to know the IP address of our Ubuntu box. To do this, type ifconfig in the command shell of the Ubuntu server. From the above screenshot, we know that the IP address of the server is 192.168.0.20 Step 3 ? Next step is installing SSH on the server. In order to SSH to a server, you need to make sure it is installed. Run the following command in the Ubuntu server command prompt session. 
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
 Step 4 ? Launch PuTTY. Enter the IP address of the Ubuntu server and click the Open button. Step 5 ? The next screen requests to accept the encrypted key sent from the server. Step 6 ? Finally, enter the username and password to log into the server. We have successfully established a secure shell to the server.

Ubuntu - Installing MySQL and Python MySQL and Python are famous database and development software respectively. These are normally installed on Linux-based systems. Let’s see how we can get them installed on Ubuntu server environments. Installing Python The first thing to do is to find out what is the version of Python installed on the system. We can find this issuing the following command. 
Python –v
 Where the –v option specifies to show what is the version of Python installed. The following screenshot shows a sample of the output of the above command. From the above output, we can see that the version of Python installed is version 2.7. There is another way to see if Python is installed via the following commands. 
Python –V
 
Python3 –V
 The later command is used to see the version 3 of Python installed. If we want to have the latest version of Python installed, then we need to issue the following statement. 
sudo apt-get install python3
 The above command will download the necessary packages for Python and have it installed. Installing MySQL To install MySQL, the following steps need to be followed. Step 1 ? Issue the apt-get command to ensure all operating system packages are up to date. 
sudo apt-get update  
 Step 2 ? Once all the packages have been updated, it is time to get the packages for MySQL. 
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
 The above command will start the download of all the relevant packages for MySQL. Once the download completes and the installation starts, the installer will first ask to configure a root password. Step 3 ? Enter the required password and click the OK button. It will also prompt to re-enter the password. Step 4 ? To see the MySQL process running, run the following command. 
ps –ef | grep mysql
 The following screenshot shows mysqld which is the daemon process for mysql running in the background. Step 5 ? To configure mysql, run the following command. 
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
 It prompts to enter the root password which was entered during the installation process. Step 6 ? Enter the password and hit Enter. Now, it prompts on whether we want to change the root password. Step 7 ? Enter ‘N’ for No and proceed. Again, it prompts on whether we want to remove the Anonymous access. Step 8 ? When connecting from other machines on this database, it is advised to keep the default options as ‘N’ for both anonymous users and disallow root login remotely. Step 9 ? It is advised to provide the option as No for the options of Remove test database as well. We can enter ‘Y’ to reload the privileges table. Finally, the configuration of MySQL will be complete. Ubuntu - Node.js Node.js is a popular JavaScript framework used for developing server side applications. In this chapter, we will see how to get Node.js installed on Ubuntu. Following are the steps to get Node.js installed. Step 1 ? Run the following command. 
sudo apt-get install nodejs
 This will install all the necessary packages for Node.js Next, we need to install the Node package manager which is required for Node.js applications. Step 2 ? Run the following command. 
sudo apt-get install npm
 All the necessary packages for the node package manager will be installed. Step 3 ? Next, create a symbolic link to the Node.js folder. Then, run the Node –v command and npm –v to see the Node and npm version installed. Ubuntu - Docker Docker is a container service which allows one to run applications or even operating systems on a host operating system as containers. Containers are a new and exciting technology that has evolved over the last couple of years and being adopted by a lot of key organizations. Docker is a company that develops these special containers for applications. The official website for Docker is https://www.docker.com/ As an exercise, let’s install a CentOS container on an Ubuntu system. CentOS is a Linux-based operating system from Red Hat. Thus, we will be running the CentOS system on top of Ubuntu. Following are the steps to have this in place. Step 1 ? The first step is to install the Docker application on Ubuntu server. Thus on the Ubuntu test server, run the following command to ensure that OS updates are in place. 
sudo apt-get update             
 Step 2 ? Once all updates have been processed, issue the following command to get Docker installed. 
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
 Step 3 ? Once the Docker packages are installed, we should receive an output message stating that the Docker process has started and is running. The Docker process is known as the Docker engine or Docker daemon. Step 4 ? To view the version of Docker running, issue the Docker info command. Step 5 ? The next step is to install our CentOS image on Ubuntu. Docker has a special site called the Docker hub, which is used to store pre-built images for Docker. The link to the site is https://hub.docker.com/ Step 6 ? Do a quick and simple sign-in process to be able to log into the site and see all the available Docker images. Step 7 ? Once logged in, click the Explore button to see all the available Docker images. The two important points to note are ? The Docker pull command. This is the command to install the Docker image on Linux box. The Docker details for the various versions of CentOS. Step 8 ? On Ubuntu box, run the command. 
sudo docker pull centos:latest
 The download of the Docker component starts and the CentOS Docker is downloaded. The name of the Docker image is centos:latest, which means that we have the latest Docker image for CentOS. Step 9 ? To see all the Docker images installed, issue the command 
sudo docker images
 In the following screenshot, we can see that the Docker image is just 196.8 MB in size, and this is the subset of the CentOS which now runs on Ubuntu system. Step 10 ? To start CentOS, we need to issue a command to the OS to get a thread started. We can do this by running the following command. 
sudo docker run -it centos /bin/bash
 The above command does the following things ? Runs the CentOS Docker image. Runs the image in interactive mode by using the -it option. Runs the /bin/bash command as the initial process. Ubuntu - On the Cloud We can also install Ubuntu on various cloud environments such as Google Cloud, Amazon web services, and Azure web services. In this chapter, we will see how to get Ubuntu up and running on Amazon web services. Following are the steps to get this in place. Step 1 ? One can get a free account with Amazon web services. All we need to do is register with AWS on the following url ? https://aws.amazon.com/ Step 2 ? Click the Sign in to the Console and it presents the following dialog box. Step 3 ? Click the option ‘I am a new user’ and enter the required email id of an existing Gmail account. Then click the ‘Sign in using our secure server’ button. We will then need to give some information in the subsequent screen to create an account. Step 4 ? Once an account has been created, we can log into the console. Once logged in, click the EC2 option. This option is used for creating virtual machines on the cloud. Step 5 ? In the following screenshot, click the Launch Instance button. Step 6 ? The next screen prompts to select an appropriate AMI. An AMI is a pre-built image for an operating system in Amazon. Scroll down until to the Ubuntu option and click the Select button. Step 7 ? In the next screen, choose the configuration of the machine. Choose the General purpose – t2.micro option and then click the ‘Next: Configure Instance Details’ button. Step 8 ? In the next screen, enter the following details as shown in the screenshot. The number of instances to launch – Keep 1 as the default. VPC – If there is no existing VPC, choose the option to create a new one. Now, if we choose the option to create a new subnet, we need to perform the following sub steps. Click the Create VPC button. (Note: The VPC is known as a virtual private network which is used to store all AWS objects in an isolated environment.) In the Create VPC dialog box, enter the following details and click the ‘Yes Create’ button. For the subnet, keep the default setting as it is. For the Auto-assign Public IP option, choose ‘use subnet setting(Enable)’. Keep the IAM Role as ‘none’. Keep the Shutdown behavior as ‘none’. The remaining settings can remain as by default. Click the Next: Add Storage button. Step 9 ? In the next screen, keep the default storage as is and click the Review and Launch button. Step 10 ? The review screen will pop up. Click the Launch button. Step 11 ? The next screen prompts to create a new key pair. This is required to log into the instance when it is created. Enter a key name and click the download Key pair button. Step 12 ? Once download is complete, click the Launch Instances button. Step 13 ? Click the ‘View Instances’ button. Step 14 ? Once the state of the instance is running, click the Connect button. The next dialog box presents the steps to log into the Ubuntu server machine. Step 15 ?
