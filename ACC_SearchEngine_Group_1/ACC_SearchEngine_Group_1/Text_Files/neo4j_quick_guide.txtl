It is highly scalable and schema free (NoSQL). What is a Graph Database? A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. It is composed of two elements - nodes (vertices) and relationships (edges). Graph database is a database used to model the data in the form of graph. In here, the nodes of a graph depict the entities while the relationships depict the association of these nodes. Popular Graph Databases Neo4j is a popular Graph Database. Other Graph Databases are Oracle NoSQL Database, OrientDB, HypherGraphDB, GraphBase, InfiniteGraph, and AllegroGraph. Why Graph Databases? Nowadays, most of the data exists in the form of the relationship between different objects and more often, the relationship between the data is more valuable than the data itself. Relational databases store highly structured data which have several records storing the same type of data so they can be used to store structured data and, they do not store the relationships between the data. Unlike other databases, graph databases store relationships and connections as first-class entities. The data model for graph databases is simpler compared to other databases and, they can be used with OLTP systems. They provide features like transactional integrity and operational availability. RDBMS Vs Graph Database Following is the table which compares Relational databases and Graph databases. Sr.No RDBMS Graph Database 1 Tables Graphs 2 Rows Nodes 3 Columns and Data Properties and its values 4 Constraints Relationships 5 Joins Traversal Advantages of Neo4j Following are the advantages of Neo4j. Flexible data model ? Neo4j provides a flexible simple and yet powerful data model, which can be easily changed according to the applications and industries. Real-time insights ? Neo4j provides results based on real-time data. High availability ? Neo4j is highly available for large enterprise real-time applications with transactional guarantees. Connected and semi structures data ? Using Neo4j, you can easily represent connected and semi-structured data. Easy retrieval ? Using Neo4j, you can not only represent but also easily retrieve (traverse/navigate) connected data faster when compared to other databases. Cypher query language ? Neo4j provides a declarative query language to represent the graph visually, using an ascii-art syntax. The commands of this language are in human readable format and very easy to learn. No joins ? Using Neo4j, it does NOT require complex joins to retrieve connected/related data as it is very easy to retrieve its adjacent node or relationship details without joins or indexes. Features of Neo4j Following are the notable features of Neo4j ? Data model (flexible schema) ? Neo4j follows a data model named native property graph model. Here, the graph contains nodes (entities) and these nodes are connected with each other (depicted by relationships). Nodes and relationships store data in key-value pairs known as properties. In Neo4j, there is no need to follow a fixed schema. You can add or remove properties as per requirement. It also provides schema constraints. ACID properties ? Neo4j supports full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) rules. Scalability and reliability ? You can scale the database by increasing the number of reads/writes, and the volume without effecting the query processing speed and data integrity. Neo4j also provides support for replication for data safety and reliability. Cypher Query Language ? Neo4j provides a powerful declarative query language known as Cypher. It uses ASCII-art for depicting graphs. Cypher is easy to learn and can be used to create and retrieve relations between data without using the complex queries like Joins. Built-in web application ? Neo4j provides a built-in Neo4j Browser web application. Using this, you can create and query your graph data. Drivers ? Neo4j can work with ? REST API to work with programming languages such as Java, Spring, Scala etc. Java Script to work with UI MVC frameworks such as Node JS. It supports two kinds of Java API: Cypher API and Native Java API to develop Java applications. In addition to these, you can also work with other databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, etc. Indexing ? Neo4j supports Indexes by using Apache Lucence. Neo4j - Data Model Neo4j Property Graph Data Model Neo4j Graph Database follows the Property Graph Model to store and manage its data. Following are the key features of Property Graph Model ? The model represents data in Nodes, Relationships and Properties Properties are key-value pairs Nodes are represented using circle and Relationships are represented using arrow keys Relationships have directions: Unidirectional and Bidirectional Each Relationship contains "Start Node" or "From Node" and "To Node" or "End Node" Both Nodes and Relationships contain properties Relationships connects nodes In Property Graph Data Model, relationships should be directional. If we try to create relationships without direction, then it will throw an error message. In Neo4j too, relationships should be directional. If we try to create relationships without direction, then Neo4j will throw an error message saying that "Relationships should be directional". Neo4j Graph Database stores all of its data in Nodes and Relationships. We neither need any additional RRBMS Database nor any SQL database to store Neo4j database data. It stores its data in terms of Graphs in its native format. Neo4j uses Native GPE (Graph Processing Engine) to work with its Native graph storage format. The main building blocks of Graph DB Data Model are ? Nodes Relationships Properties Following is a simple example of a Property Graph. Here, we have represented Nodes using Circles. Relationships are represented using Arrows. Relationships are directional. We can represent Node's data in terms of Properties (key-value pairs). In this example, we have represented each Node's Id property within the Node's Circle. Neo4j - Environment Setup In this chapter, we will discuss how to install Neo4j in your system using exe file. Neo4j Database Server Setup with Windows exe File Follow the steps given below to download Neo4j into your system. Step 1 ? Visit the Neo4j official site using https://neo4j.com/. On clicking, this link will take you to the homepage of neo4j website. Step 2 ? As highlighted in the above screenshot, this page has a Download button on the top right hand side. Click it. Step 3 ?

This will download a file named neo4j-community_windows-x64_3_1_1.exe to your system as shown in the following screenshot. Step 5 ? Double-click the exe file to install Neo4j Server. Step 6 ? Accept the license agreement and proceed with the installation. After completion of the process, you can observe that Neo4j is installed in your system. Starting the Server Step 1 ? Click the Windows startmenu and start the Neo4j server by clicking the start menu shortcut for Neo4j. Step 2 ? On clicking the shortcut, you will get a window for Neo4j Community edition. By default, it selects c:\Users\[username]\Documents\Neo4j\default.graphdb. If you want, you can change your path to a different directory. Step 3 ? Click the "Start" button to start the Neo4j server. Once the server starts, you can observe that the database directory is populated as shown in the following screenshot. Working with Neo4j As discussed in the previous chapters, neo4j provides an in-built browse application to work with Neo4j. You can access Neo4j using the URL http://localhost:7474/ Neo4j - Building Blocks Neo4j Graph Database has the following building blocks ? Nodes Properties Relationships Labels Data Browser Node Node is a fundamental unit of a Graph. It contains properties with key-value pairs as shown in the following image. Here, Node Name = "Employee" and it contains a set of properties as key-value pairs. Properties Property is a key-value pair to describe Graph Nodes and Relationships. 
Key = Value 
 Where Key is a String and Value may be represented using any Neo4j Data types. Relationships Relationships are another major building block of a Graph Database. It connects two nodes as depicted in the following figure. Here, Emp and Dept are two different nodes. "WORKS_FOR" is a relationship between Emp and Dept nodes. As it denotes, the arrow mark from Emp to Dept, this relationship describes ? 
Emp WORKS_FOR Dept 
 Each relationship contains one start node and one end node. Here, "Emp" is a start node, and "Dept" is an end node. As this relationship arrow mark represents a relationship from "Emp" node to "Dept" node, this relationship is known as an "Incoming Relationship" to "Dept" Node and "Outgoing Relationship" to "Emp" node. Like nodes, relationships also can contain properties as key-value pairs. Here, "WORKS_FOR" relationship has one property as key-value pair. 
Id = 123 
 It represents an Id of this relationship. Labels Label associates a common name to a set of nodes or relationships. A node or relationship can contain one or more labels. We can create new labels to existing nodes or relationships. We can remove the existing labels from the existing nodes or relationships. From the previous diagram, we can observe that there are two nodes. Left side node has a Label: "Emp" and the right side node has a Label: "Dept". Relationship between those two nodes also has a Label: "WORKS_FOR". Note ? Neo4j stores data in Properties of Nodes or Relationships. Neo4j Data Browser Once we install Neo4j, we can access Neo4j Data Browser using the following URL 
http://localhost:7474/browser/
 Neo4j Data Browser is used to execute CQL commands and view the output. Here, we need to execute all CQL commands at dollar prompt: "$" Type commands after the dollar symbol and click the "Execute" button to run your commands. It interacts with Neo4j Database Server, retrieves and displays the results just below the dollar prompt. Use "VI View" button to view the results in diagrams format. The above diagram shows results in "UI View" format. Use "Grid View" button to view the results in Grid View. The following diagram shows the same results in "Grid View" format. When we use "Grid View" to view our Query results, we can export them into a file in two different formats. CSV Click the "Export CSV" button to export the results in csv file format. JSON Click the "Export JSON" button to export the results in JSON file format. However, if we use "UI View" to see our Query results, we can export them into a file in only one format: JSON Neo4j CQL - Introduction CQL stands for Cypher Query Language. Like Oracle Database has query language SQL, Neo4j has CQL as query language. Neo4j CQL Is a query language for Neo4j Graph Database. Is a declarative pattern-matching language. Follows SQL like syntax. Syntax is very simple and in human readable format. Like Oracle SQL Neo4j CQL has commands to perform Database operations. Neo4j CQL supports many clauses such as WHERE, ORDER BY, etc., to write very complex queries in an easy manner. Neo4j CQL supports some functions such as String, Aggregation. In addition to them, it also supports some Relationship Functions. Neo4j CQL Clauses Following are the read clauses of Neo4j Cypher Query Language ? Sr.No Read Clauses Usage 1 MATCH This clause is used to search the data with a specified pattern. 2 OPTIONAL MATCH This is the same as match, the only difference being it can use nulls in case of missing parts of the pattern. 3 WHERE This clause id is used to add contents to the CQL queries. 4 START This clause is used to find the starting points through the legacy indexes. 5 LOAD CSV This clause is used to import data from CSV files. Following are the write clauses of Neo4j Cypher Query Language ? Sr.No Write Clause Usage 1 CREATE This clause is used to create nodes, relationships, and properties. 2 MERGE This clause verifies whether the specified pattern exists in the graph. If not, it creates the pattern. 3 SET This clause is used to update labels on nodes, properties on nodes and relationships. 4 DELETE This clause is used to delete nodes and relationships or paths etc. from the graph. 5 REMOVE This clause is used to remove properties and elements from nodes and relationships. 6 FOREACH This class is used to update the data within a list. 7 CREATE UNIQUE Using the clauses CREATE and MATCH, you can get a unique pattern by matching the existing pattern and creating the missing one. 8 Importing CSV files with Cypher Using Load CSV you can import data from .csv files. Following are the general clauses of Neo4j Cypher Query Language ? Sr.No General Clauses Usage 1 RETURN This clause is used to define what to include in the query result set. 2 ORDER BY This clause is used to arrange the output of a query in order. It is used along with the clauses RETURN or WITH. 3 LIMIT This clause is used to limit the rows in the result to a specific value. 4 SKIP This clause is used to define from which row to start including the rows in the output. 5 WITH This clause is used to chain the query parts together. 6 UNWIND This clause is used to expand a list into a sequence of rows. 7 UNION This clause is used to combine the result of multiple queries. 8 CALL This clause is used to invoke a procedure deployed in the database. Neo4j CQL Functions Following are the frequently used Neo4j CQL Functions ? Sr.No CQL Functions Usage 1 String They are used to work with String literals. 2 Aggregation They are used to perform some aggregation operations on CQL Query results. 3 Relationship They are used to get details of relationships such as startnode, endnode, etc. We will discuss all Neo4j CQL commands, clauses and functions syntax, usage and examples in-detail in the subsequent chapters. Neo4j CQL Data Types These data types are similar to Java language. They are used to define properties of a node or a relationship. Neo4j CQL supports the following data types ?

Neo4j - Merge Command MERGE command is a combination of CREATE command and MATCH command. Neo4j CQL MERGE command searches for a given pattern in the graph. If it exists, then it returns the results. If it does NOT exist in the graph, then it creates a new node/relationship and returns the results. In this chapter you are going to learn how to ? Merge a node with label Merge a node with properties OnCreate and OnMatch Merge a relationship Syntax Following is the syntax for the MERGE command. 
MERGE (node: label {properties . . . . . . . }) 
 Before proceeding to the examples in this section, create two nodes in the database with labels Dhawan and Ind. Create a relationship of type “BATSMAN_OF” from Dhawan to Ind as shown below. 
CREATE (Dhawan:player{name: "Shikar Dhawan", YOB: 1985, POB: "Delhi"}) 
CREATE (Ind:Country {name: "India"}) 
CREATE (Dhawan)-[r:BATSMAN_OF]->(Ind) 
 Merging a Node with a Label You can merge a node in the database based on the label using the MERGE clause. If you try to merge a node based on the label, then Neo4j verifies whether there exists any node with the given label. If not, the current node will be created. Syntax Following is the syntax to merge a node based on a label. 
MERGE (node:label) RETURN node 
 Example 1 Following is a sample Cypher Query which merges a node into Neo4j (based on label). When you execute this query, Neo4j verifies whether there is any node with the label player. If not, it creates a node named “Jadeja” and returns it. If, there exists any node with the given label, Neo4j returns them all. 
MERGE (Jadeja:player) RETURN Jadeja 
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and start the Neo4j Server. Open the built-in browser app of Neo4j using the URL http://localhost:7474/ as shown in the following screenshot. Step 2 ? Copy and paste the desired query in the dollar prompt and press the play button (to execute the query) highlighted in the following screenshot. Result On executing, you will get the following result. Since you have already created a node named “Dhawan” with the label “player” in the database, Neo4j returns it as shown in the following screenshot. Example 2 Now, try to merge a node named “CT2013” with a label named Tournament. Since there are no nodes with this label, Neo4j creates a node with the given name and returns it. 
MERGE (CT2013:Tournament{name: "ICC Champions Trophy 2013"}) 
RETURN CT2013, labels(CT2013)
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and Start the Neo4j Server. Open the built-in browser app of Neo4j using the URL http://localhost:7474/ as shown in the following screenshot. Step 2 ? Copy and paste the desired query in the dollar prompt and press the play button (to execute the query) highlighted in the following screenshot. Result On executing, you will get the following result. As discussed, since there is no node with the given label (Tournament). Neo4j creates and returns the specified node as shown in the following screenshot. Merging a Node with Properties You can also merge a node with a set of properties. If you do so, Neo4j searches for an equal match for the specified node, including the properties. If it doesn’t find any, it creates one. Syntax Following is the syntax to merge a node using properties. 
MERGE (node:label {key1:value, key2:value, key3:value . . . . . . . . }) 
 Example Following is a sample Cypher Query to merge a node using properties. This query tries to merge the node named “jadeja” using properties and label. Since there is no such node with the exact label and properties, Neo4j creates one. 
MERGE (Jadeja:player {name: "Ravindra Jadeja", YOB: 1988, POB: "NavagamGhed"}) 
RETURN Jadeja 
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and Start the Neo4j Server.

As discussed, since there are no nodes with the specified label and properties, it creates one, as shown in the following screenshot. OnCreate and OnMatch Whenever, we execute a merge query, a node is either matched or created. Using on create and on match, you can set properties for indicating whether the node is created or matched. Syntax Following is the syntax of OnCreate and OnMatch clauses. 
MERGE (node:label {properties . . . . . . . . . . .}) 
ON CREATE SET property.isCreated ="true" 
ON MATCH SET property.isFound ="true"
 Example Following is a sample Cypher Query which demonstrates the usage of OnCreate and OnMatch clauses in Neo4j. If the specified node already exists in the database, then the node will be matched and the property with key-value pair isFound = "true" will be created in the node. If the specified node doesn’t exist in the database, then the node will be created, and within it a property with a key-value pair isCreated ="true" will be created. 
MERGE (Jadeja:player {name: "Ravindra Jadeja", YOB: 1988, POB: "NavagamGhed"}) 
ON CREATE SET Jadeja.isCreated = "true" 
ON MATCH SET Jadeja.isFound = "true" 
RETURN Jadeja

Neo4j - String Functions Like SQL, Neo4J CQL has provided a set of String functions to use them in CQL Queries to get the required results. Here, we are going to discuss some of the important and frequently used functions. String Functions List Following is the list of prominent String functions in Neo4j. Sr.No Function & Description 1 UPPER It is used to change all letters into upper case letters. 2 LOWER It is used to change all letters into lower case letters. 3 SUBSTRING It is used to get substring of a given String. 4 Replace It is used to replace a substring with a given substring of a String. Neo4j - Aggregation Function Like SQL, Neo4j CQL has provided some aggregation functions to use in RETURN clause. It is similar to GROUP BY clause in SQL. We can use this RETURN + Aggregation Functions in MATCH command to work on a group of nodes and return some aggregated value. AGGREGATION Functions List Following is the list of aggregation functions in Neo4j. Sr.No Function & Description 1 COUNT It returns the number of rows returned by MATCH command. 2 MAX It returns the maximum value from a set of rows returned by MATCH command. 3 MIN It returns the minimum value from a set of rows returned by MATCH command. 4 SUM It returns the summation value of all rows returned by MATCH command. 5 AVG It returns the average value of all rows returned by MATCH command. Neo4j - Backup & Restore In real-time applications, we should take backup of our application database regularly, so that we can restore to some working condition at any failure point. This rule is applicable for both RDBMS and NoSQL databases. In this section, we are going to discuss about two important DBA tasks. How to back up a Neo4j Database. How to restore Neo4j Database to a specific backup. Note ? These steps are applicable to Windows Operating System only. We should use similar kind of commands to do the same steps in other operating systems. Neo4j Database Backup Step 1 ? Click "Neo4j Community" using the following path ? Windows "Start" button ? "All Programs" ? "Neo4j Community" ? "Neo4j Community" By default, it selects c:\Users\[username]\Documents\Neo4j\default.graphdb. However if we wish to, we can change the path to a different directory. Step 2 ? Here we have changed to our Neo4j Database folder. C:\Ne04j2.0db Step 3 ? Click the "Start" button. Once the server starts, we can observe our Neo4j Database files are generated at a specified directory. Before taking a database backup, the first and foremost thing we should do is shutdown the Neo4j Database server. Step 4 ? Click the "Stop" button to shut down the server. Neo4j Database files are available at C:\Ne04j2.0db Step 5 ? Open the command prompt. Step 6 ? Create a folder "Neo4jDbBackup-01" at C:\Neo4j (This may be any location in your file system). 
mkdir C:\Neo4j\Neo4jDbBackup-01 
 It creates a new folder "Neo4jDbBackup-01" at the specified file system location "C:\Neo4j\" Step 7 ? Type the following command and press Enter key. 
copy C:\Ne04j2.0db C:\Neo4j\Neo4jDbBackup-01 
 This means our files are copied to the required destination folder. Access that folder and observe that the folder has our database files. Step 8 ? Use any Windows compression/decompression tool like WinZip, 7 Zip, or WinRAR to zip our Database folder. Step 9 ? Now our Neo4jDbBackup-01.zip file is created. If you have any memory constraints in your file system, then remove "Neo4jDbBackup-01" folder at "C:\Neo4j\" Neo4j Database Restore Step 1 ? Shutdown the database server. Please refer to the previous steps to shut down the server. Step 2 ? Empty the current database folder. Step 3 ? Use any Windows compression/decompression tool like WinZip, 7 Zip, or WinRar to unzip our backup folder. Step 4 ? Open the command prompt and execute the following command. 
Copy C:\Neo4j\Neo4jDbBackup-01 C:\Ne04j2.0db 
 Now we can observe that our database folder contains working backup files Step 5 ? Start the server by clicking the "Start" button. Step 6 ? Execute some MATCH + RETURN commands to verify whether we have restored our database properly. Neo4j - Index Neo4j SQL supports Indexes on node or relationship properties to improve the performance of the application. We can create indexes on properties for all nodes, which have the same label name. We can use these indexed columns on MATCH or WHERE or IN operator to improve the execution of CQL command. In this chapter, we will discuss how to ? Create an Index Delete an Index Creating an Index Neo4j CQL provides "CREATE INDEX" command to create indexes on Node or Relationship properties. Syntax Following is the syntax to create an index in Neo4j. 
CREATE INDEX ON:label (node) 
 Example Before proceeding with the example, create a node Dhawan as shown below. 
CREATE (Dhawan:player{name: "shikar Dhawan", YOB: 1995, POB: "Delhi"})
 Following is a sample Cypher Query to create an index on the node Dhawan in Neo4j. 
CREATE INDEX ON:player(Dhawan) 
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and start the Neo4j Server. Open the built-in browser app of Neo4j using the URL http://localhost:7474/ as shown below. Step 2 ? Copy and paste the desired query in the dollar prompt and press the play button (to execute the query) highlighted in the following screenshot. Result On executing, you will get the following result. Deleting an Index Neo4j CQL provides a "DROP INDEX" command to drop an existing index of a Node or Relationshis property. Syntax Following is the syntax to create an index in Neo4j. 
DROP INDEX ON:label(node) 
 Example Following is a sample Cypher Query to create an index on the node named “Dhawan” in Neo4j. 
DROP INDEX ON:player(Dhawan) 
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and start the Neo4j Server. Open the built-in browser app of Neo4j using the URL http://localhost:7474/ as shown in the following screenshot. Step 2 ? Copy and paste the desired query in the dollar prompt and press the play button (to execute the query) highlighted in the following screenshot. Result On executing, you will get the following result. Neo4j - Create Unique Constraint In Neo4j database, CQL CREATE command always creates a new node or relationship which means even though you use the same values, it inserts a new row. As per our application requirements for some nodes or relationships, we have to avoid this duplication. For this, we should use some database constraints to create a rule on one or more properties of a node or relationship. Like SQL, Neo4j database also supports UNIQUE constraint on node or relationship properties. UNIQUE constraint is used to avoid duplicate records and to enforce data integrity rule. Create UNIQUE Constraint Neo4j CQL provides "CREATE CONSTRAINT" command to create unique constraints on node or relationship properties. Syntax Following is the syntax to create a UNIQUE constraint in Neo4j. 
MATCH (root {name: "Dhawan"}) 
CREATE UNIQUE (root)-[:LOVES]-(someone) 
RETURN someone 
 Example Before proceeding with the example, create 4 nodes as shown below. 
CREATE(Dhawan:player{id:001, name: "shikar Dhawan", YOB: 1995, POB: "Delhi"}) 
CREATE(Jonathan:player {id:002, name: "Jonathan Trott", YOB: 1981, POB: "CapeTown"}) 
CREATE(Sangakkara:player {id:003, name: "Kumar Sangakkara", YOB: 1977, POB: "Matale"}) 
CREATE(Rohit:player {id:004, name: "Rohit Sharma", YOB: 1987, POB: "Nagpur"}) 
CREATE(Virat:player {id:005, name: "Virat Kohli", YOB: 1988, POB: "Delhi"}) 
 Following is a sample Cypher Query to create a UNIQUE constraint on the property id using Neo4j. 
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:player) ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and start the Neo4j Server.

CREATE (Jadeja:player {id:002, name: "Ravindra Jadeja", YOB: 1988, POB: "NavagamGhed"}) 
 If you execute this query, you will get an error message as shown in the following screenshot. Neo4j - Drop Unique We have already discussed creating UNIQUE constraint operations with examples in the previous chapter. In this chapter, we will discuss dropping UNIQUE constraint operation with examples. Neo4j CQL provides "DROP CONSTRAINT" command to delete existing Unique constraint from a node or relationship property. Syntax Following is the syntax for dropping a UNIQUE constraint in Neo4j. 
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (node:label) 
ASSERT node.id IS UNIQUE 
 Example Following is a sample Cypher Query to remove the UNIQUE constraint on the property id. 
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:player) 
ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE 
 To execute the above query, carry out the following steps ? Step 1 ? Open the Neo4j desktop App and start the Neo4j Server.
