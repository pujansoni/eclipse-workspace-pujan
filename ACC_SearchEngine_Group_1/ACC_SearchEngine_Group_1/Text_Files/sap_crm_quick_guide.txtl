Some of these transactions available in SAP Easy access are discussed below. CIC0: Customer Interaction Center COMMPR01: Maintain Products SAP CRM - WebClient UI SAP GUI is used to perform administration tasks in SAP CRM. To perform customization and configuration of CRM activities, a client tool is recommended by SAP which is known as SAP CRM WebClient User Interface. How to Login to SAP CRM WebClient? You can login to SAP CRM WebClient via SAP GUI. To open the login window, you can use the following transaction code ? T-Code: CRM_UI and press Enter.

When there are multiple roles assigned to a user, he/she can select one of the available roles in order to log-in to the CRM Web UI. SAP CRM WebClient is divided into three parts, which are ? Navigation bar Header Area Work Area The entire frame in UI WebClient is known as the Navigation bar. You can navigate to different pages in this Navigation bar. The Header area is at the top and contains the system links, work area title, saved searches, history, etc. The Work area is a place where changes happen with user actions and where user works. The work area also contains work center groups, overview pages, email inbox, etc. The following is a list of all the components in a SAP CRM WebClient UI ?

It can also contain <transaction type> if several transactions are derived from the same object type and only differentiated by the transaction type name. For example ? The work title for an overview page of an opportunity with Id = 8650 and Description = Sell Desktop and Prospect = TEST Cust will be presented as ? Opportunity: 8650, Sell Desktop, TEST Cust Saved Searches This area provides you direct access to a list of predefined search queries. The central search provides direct access to searches using one single search field. Navigation Area The Navigation bar allows you to navigate through the CRM applications and component functions that we use to access or enter the data quickly.

SAP CRM - Web UI Configuration To perform the enhancements in the SAP SRM WebClient, you can use Web UI configuration and application enhancement tools. These tools allow you to add new fields, change layout, add tables, etc. to the existing applications. In any general scenario, companies don’t prefer to use standard applications and some customizations are required. The following tools can be used ? Web UI Configuration Tool Application Enhancement Tool In a SAP CRM WebClient, there is an option to access Web UI configuration tool as per the authorization. There are predefined roles to which these buttons are available. To make any changes to the WebClient configuration and customization, a user must have sufficient privilege. Configurable Area ? This option is used to highlight the area on the page which is configurable. Configure Page ? This option allows you to view pop ups that are used to configure a page. Personalization ? Personalization is performed by end users and configuration is done by administrators, project teams. It is used to change the layout of the tool for individual users and not for a group of users. To perform personalization, a personalization dialog is used with which a user can adapt the UI of the application. Note ? Most of the dialogs to perform personalization are created generically and their structure can’t be altered. You can also create application specific dialogs to change the structure of dialog to some extent but SAP recommends that you should use the same dialog structure as for the standard dialogs. Structure of a Personalized Dialog box A Personalization dialog box contains the following components ? Dialog Title Message Bar Help Icon and Help text Property group Property Values Finalizing Buttons When a user makes changes to this personalization dialog box, he can use the following finalizing options to execute. Reset to Default ? This option is used to set the property value back to the default value of the application. This function has to be offered for each property in order to avoid data loss on properties for which the user did not want to reset to the default. If the dialog is not very complex, this button can also be placed in the button row of the finalization buttons. Save ? This option is used to save the changes and to close the dialog box. Cancel ? This option is used to close the current personalization dialog and navigating back to the previous page or closing the dialog box without saving any changes. Configuration of the Navigation Bar When a user logs-in to the WebClient, on the left side they can see the Navigation bar profile.
