We will understand how to start PowerPoint 2010 application in simple steps. To access PowerPoint 2010, you must have Microsoft Office 2010 installed in your PC. Only Office 2010 Home and Student, Home and Business, Standard, Professional and Professional Plus packages have PowerPoint included in them. Other packages may have a viewer, but you cannot create presentations with them. Step 1 ? Click the Start button. Step 2 ? Click All Programs option from the menu. Step 3 ? Search for Microsoft Office from the sub menu and click it. Step 4 ? Search for Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 from the submenu and click it. This will launch the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 application and you will see the following presentation window. Explore Windows in Powerpoint 2010 The following screenshot shows the various areas in a standard PowerPoint file. It is important to familiarize yourself with these areas as it makes learning and using PowerPoint easier. File Tab This tab opens the Backstage view which basically allows you to manage the file and settings in PowerPoint. You can save presentations, open existing ones and create new presentations based on blank or predefined templates. The other file related operations can also be executed from this view. Ribbon The ribbon contains three components ? Tabs ? They appear across the top of the Ribbon and contain groups of related commands. Home, Insert, Page Layout are examples of ribbon tabs. Groups ? They organize related commands; each group name appears below the group on the Ribbon. For example, a group of commands related to fonts or a group of commands related to alignment, etc. Commands ? Commands appear within each group as mentioned above. Title Bar This is the top section of the window. It shows the name of the file followed by the name of the program which in this case is Microsoft PowerPoint. Slide Area This is the area where the actual slide is created and edited. You can add, edit and delete text, images, shapes and multimedia in this section. Help The Help Icon can be used to get PowerPoint related help anytime you need. Clicking on the "?" opens the PowerPoint Help window where you have a list of common topics to browse from. You can also search for specific topics from the search bar at the top. Zoom Options The zoom control lets you zoom in for a closer look at your text. The zoom control consists of a slider that you can slide left or right to zoom in or out, you can click on the - and + buttons to increase or decrease the zoom factor. The maximum zoom supported by PowerPoint is 400% and the 100% is indicated by the mark in the middle. Slide Views The group of four buttons located to the left of the Zoom control, near the bottom of the screen, lets you switch between PowerPoint views. Normal Layout view ? This displays page in normal view with the slide on the right and a list of thumbnails to the left. This view allows you to edit individual slides and also rearrange them. Slide Sorter view ? This displays all the slides as a matrix. This view only allows you to rearrange the slides but not edit the contents of each slide. Reading View ? This view is like a slideshow with access to the Windows task bar in case you need to switch windows. However, like the slideshow you cannot edit anything in this view. Notes Section This sections allows you to add notes for the presentation. These notes will not be displayed on the screen during the presentation; these are just quick reference for the presenter. Quick Access Toolbar The Quick Access Toolbar is located just under the ribbon. This toolbar offers a convenient place to group the most commonly used commands in PowerPoint. You can customize this toolbar to suit your needs. Slide Tab This section is available only in the Normal view. It displays all the slides in sequence. You can add, delete and reorder slides from this section. Backstage View in Powerpoint 2010 In Office 2010, Microsoft replaced the traditional file menu with the new Backstage view. This view not only offers all the menu items under the file menu, but additional details which makes management of your files a lot easier. Accessing Backstage View You can access the Backstage view simply by clicking on the File tab. You can exit this view by clicking on any tab (including the File tab again). You can also press the 'Esc' button on the keyboard. Organization of Backstage View The backstage view has three sections or panes. First Pane ? This is the commands pane which consists of all the commands you would typically find in the file menu of older versions. You also have the Options menu which lets you edit the options on the program like customizing the ribbon. Various commands under the first pane are described in the table below ? S.No Command & Description 1 Save This allows you to save a new file or an existing file in standard format. If you are working on a previously saved file this will save the new changes in the same file format. If you are working on a new file, this command would be similar to the Save As command. 2 Save As Allows you to specify the file name and the file type before saving the file. 3 Open Allows you to open new PowerPoint files. 4 Close Allows you to close an existing file. 5 Info Displays the information about the current file. 6 Recent Lists series of recently viewed or edited PowerPoint files. 7 New Allows you to create a new file using blank or pre-defined templates. 8 Print Allows you to select the printer settings and print the presentation. 9 Save & Send Allows you to share your presentation with larger audience via emails, web, cloud services, etc. 10 Help Provides access to PowerPoint Help. 11 Options Allows you to set various options related to PowerPoint program. 12 Exit Closes the presentation and exits the program. Second Pane ? This is the subcommands pane. This will list all the commands related to the main command you choose in the first pane. For example, if you select Print in the first pane, you get to choose the printer and adjust the print settings in the second pane. Third Pane ? This is the preview or file information page. Depending on the command and the subcommand you select, this pane will either display the properties of the file or give you a preview of the file. Create Presentation using Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint offers a host of tools that will aid you in creating a presentation. These tools are organized logically into various ribbons in PowerPoint. The table below describes the various commands you can access from the different menus. Menu Category Ribbon Commands Home Clipboard functions, manipulating slides, fonts, paragraph settings, drawing objects and editing functions. Insert Insert tables, pictures, images, shapes, charts, special texts, multimedia and symbols. Design Slide setup, slide orientation, presentation themes and background. Transitions Commands related to slide transitions. Animations Commands related to animation within the individual slides. Slide Show Commands related to slideshow set up and previews. Review Proofing content, language selection, comments and comparing presentations. View Commands related to presentation views, Master slides, color settings and window arrangements. Besides these depending on the objects selected in the slide, there are other menu tabs that get enabled. Add New Slides in Powerpoint 2010 In this chapter, we will understand how to add new slides in an existing presentation. Here are the steps that allow you to insert a new slide in the deck ? Step 1 ? Right-click in the Navigation Pane under any existing slide and click on the New Slide option. Step 2 ? The new slide is inserted. You can now change the layout of this slide to suit your design requirements. Step 3 ? To change the slide layout, right-click on the newly inserted slide and go to the Layout option where you can choose from the existing layout styles available to you. You can follow the same steps to insert a new slide in between existing slides or at the end on the slide list. When we insert a new slide, it inherits the layout of its previous slide with one exception. If you are inserting a new slide after the first slide (Title slide), the subsequent slide will have the Title and Content layout. You will also notice that if you right-click in the first step without selecting any slide the menu options you get are different, although you can insert a new slide from this menu too. Adding Text in Boxes in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint allows users to add text to the slide in a well-defined manner to ensure the content is well distributed and easy to read. The procedure to add the text in a PowerPoint slide is always the same - just click in the text box and start typing. The text will follow the default formatting set for the text box, although this formatting can be changed later as required. What changes is the different kinds of content boxes that support text in a PowerPoint slide. Given below are some of the most common content blocks you will see in PowerPoint. Title Box This is typically found on slides with the title layout and in all the slides that have a title box in them. This box is indicated by "Click to add title". Subtitle Box This is found only in slides with the Title layout. This is indicated by "Click to add subtitle" Content Box This is found in most of the slides that have a placeholder for adding content. This is indicated by "Click to add text". As you can see, this box allows you to add text as well as non-text content. To add text to such a box, click anywhere on the box, except on one of the content icons in the center and start typing. Text Only Box This is not a default content box available in PowerPoint, but you can create it using Slide Master, if required. This is also indicated by "Click to add text". The only difference between the Text Only Box and the Content Box is that the former only supports text in the content area. Adding New Text Boxes in Powerpoint 2010 This chapter will teach you how to add new text boxes in a slide. Most of the standard layouts come with the text box option. As mentioned in the previous chapter, text boxes will have "Click to add text" as the default text. Here are the steps to add new text boxes in slide. Step 1 ? Click on the Text Box icon in the Home ribbon under the Drawing section. Step 2 ? You will get the insert text box cursor that looks like an inverted cross. Step 3 ? Click to insert a text box. You can now start typing directly into the text box. Step 4 ? Alternately, you can click and drag the cursor without releasing the click to create a text box. The size of the text box can be adjusted by selecting one of the edges marked by squares or corners marked by circles. Deleting Existing Slide in Powerpoint 2010 There are times while building a slide deck, you may need to delete some slides. This can be done easily from PowerPoint. You can delete the slides from the Normal view as well as the Slide Sorter view. In each view, you can delete the slides in two ways. Deleting from Normal View Step 1 ? Go to the Normal view. Step 2 ? Right-click on the slide to be deleted and select the Delete Slide option. Alternately, you can select the slide and press the Delete button on your key board. Deleting from Slide Sorter View Let us now understand how to deleted slides from the Slide Sorter View. Step 1 ? Go to the Slide Sorter view. Step 2 ? Right-click on the slide to be deleted and select the Delete Slide option. Alternately, you can select the slide and press the Delete button on your key board. Rearranging Slides in Powerpoint 2010 Rearranging slides is important when it comes to organizing the overall presentation flow. While it is vital that you get the right content in every slide, it is equally important that you are able to present them in a format that makes it easier for the audience to understand the content too; most times this will require rearranging the slides. You can rearrange slides from two views in PowerPoint - Normal View and Slide Sorter View. Given below are the steps to rearrange slides from different views. Normal View Step 1 ? Select the slide to be moved. Step 2 ? Left click on the slide and drag it to the position in the sequence where you want to place it. PowerPoint will indicate the insert position with a line in-between existing slides. Step 3 ? When you get to the right position release the left click button to insert the slide. Alternately you can also cut the selected slide and paste it back in the sequence as shown below. Slide Sorter View Let us now understand how the Slide Sorter View works. Step 1 ? Select the slide to be moved. Step 2 ? Left click on the slide and drag it to the position in the sequence where you want to place it. PowerPoint will indicate the insert position with a line in-between existing slides. Step 3 ? When you get to the right position release the left click button to insert the slide. Alternately you can also cut the selected slide and paste it back in the sequence as shown below. Adding Slide Notes Powerpoint 2010 Slide notes can be very useful tools for presentation. These notes are not displayed on the screen in the Slideshow mode, but the presenter can see them so they can prepare well to present the slides. Depending on your Print settings, you can also print the slide notes along with the slides. This chapter will show you how to add slide notes to an existing presentation. Step 1 ? To locate the slide notes, set the view in Normal mode. Step 2 ? The Slide Notes section is indicated by "Click to add notes". Step 3 ? You can click on the top border and drag the section to increase its size to make it easier to type. Step 4 ? Type your text in this section as slide notes. You can only use bullets, numbering and alignment functions in the Slide Notes section. All other functions can be selected, but can be applied only to the selected slide, not the notes. Slide notes can be printed from the print menu under the Backstage view. From the Print Layout option, select Notes Pages or 3 Slides. Notes Pages will print a single slide with the slide notes below it. The 3 Slides will print all three slides with notes on the right side. Managing Sections in Powerpoint 2010 Given the popularity of PowerPoint and its versatility, there are situations when you are dealing with very large slide decks or just collaborating with different people to build the slides. In such cases, it is always helpful to be able to segregate the slides into smaller groups and work with these groups. PowerPoint 2010 introduces the concept of sections to achieve this. Here are the main functions you can execute with sections. Creating Sections The steps to create a new section are as follows. You can execute these steps from the Normal view or the Slide Sorter view. Step 1 ? In the Normal view or the Slide Sorter view, right-click at the position where you want to add the section and select add section. Step 2 ? The new section gets added to the presentation with all the subsequent slides being included in this section. Step 3 ? By default, the new section is named "Untitled Section" but you can change the section name. Right-click on the section and select "Rename Section". Step 4 ? In the Rename Section dialog box, enter the new section name. This accepts all the characters including alphabets, numbers, special characters, punctuations, etc. Step 5 ? Click on the "Rename" button on the dialog to rename the section. Rearranging Sections One of the advantages of sections is that you can not only group slides together, but also rearrange them as one set. Instead of having to move each slide individually, you can move the entire section. Just like rearranging slides you can drag and move the sections. Alternately, you can right-click on the section and move it up or down as shown below. If there are many slides to work with, you can collapse them so you view just the sections. This makes rearranging them less confusing too. Deleting Sections PowerPoint 2010 provides three options to delete sections. The table below explains the function of each option. S.No Delete Option & Description 1 Remove Section Deletes the selected section and merges slides with the previous section. 2 Remove Section & Slide Deletes the selected section and all the slides in the section. 3 Remove All Sections Deletes all the sections and merges all the slides into a presentation without sections. Working With Outlines in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint is a great program that allows you to bring together text, images, shapes and multimedia. However, sometimes you may just want to review the text without focusing on the non-text aspects of the slide deck. This is where the Outline view in PowerPoint is quite useful. The Outline view can be accessed from the tab adjacent to the Slide tab in the Normal view. The outline view shows just the text content from various slides. This view does not show the text entered in the non-text box like SmartArt, WordArt or any other shapes. By default, the outline pane size is the same as the slide tab pane; hence it is small. However, you can drag the pane out to increase the size to improve readability. Sidebars in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint slides have a left-hand side bar which offers two invaluable views. These views are great to review the slides and edit them. The side bar is available in the Normal view and by default, it is set to the Slides tab. Slides Tab This tab shows all the slides stacked vertically in a sequential manner. You can select individual slides from this tab and also perform some tasks like changing slide layouts, reordering slides, inserting new slides, deleting slides, etc. Although you cannot edit the slide contents from this tab, you can select the slide and make edits from the slide displayed to the right. Outline Tab This is the tab right next to the Slides tab and as the name suggests, this provides the outline for the slide. This section just displays all the textual content from every slide - this can be very useful if there is a lot of non-text content in the slide and reviewing just the written part gets difficult. Unlike in the slides tab, you can edit the text from this section. If you need greater viewing space, you can close the sidebar by click on the X on the top right of this bar. To recover the sidebar, just click on the Normal view icon again. Presentation Views in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint supports multiple views to allow users to gain the maximum from the features available in the program. Each view supports a different set of functions and is designed accordingly. PowerPoint views can be accessed from two locations. Views can be accessed quickly from the bottom bar just to the left of the zoom settings. Views can also be accessed from the Presentation Views section in the View ribbon Here is a short description of the various views and their features. Normal View This is the default view in PowerPoint and this is primarily used to create and edit slides. You can create/ delete/ edit/ rearrange slides, add/ remove/ modify content and manipulate sections from this view. Slide Sorter View This view is primarily used to sort slides and rearrange them. This view is also ideal to add or remove sections as it presents the slides in a more compact manner making it easier to rearrange them. Reading View This view is new to PowerPoint 2010 and it was created mainly to review the slideshow without losing access to rest of the Windows applications. Typically, when you run the slideshow, the presentation takes up the entire screen so other applications cannot be accessed from the taskbar. In the reading view the taskbar is still available while viewing the slideshow which is convenient. You cannot make any modifications when on this view. SlidesShow This is the traditional slideshow view available in all the earlier versions of PowerPoint. This view is used to run the slideshow during presentation. Setting Backgrounds in Powerpoint 2010 As PowerPoint is a design-based program, backgrounds are effective ways of improving the aesthetics and readability of the slides. The Themes in PowerPoint help select the backgrounds by default, so every time you change the theme, the default background is set automatically. Theme includes more than just backgrounds, so you can retain other aspects of the theme while changing the default background. Given below are the steps to apply backgrounds in PowerPoint. Step 1 ? In the Design ribbon, under the Background group, click the Background Styles command. Step 2 ? Select one of the background styles that suits your requirements. Step 3 ? To edit the background for a specific slide, right-click on the desired background slide and select "Apply to Selected Slides". Step 4 ? Selected slide(s) now have the new background. The graphics in the slide background can distract you from the actual content, in such cases you can hide the graphics and retain a plain background till you finish working on the content. To do this, select the slide and check the "Hide Background Graphics" checkbox. Slide Orientations in Powerpoint 2010 In the recent years, presentations are being used for more than just as a high end replacement for transparencies and projectors. With its unique features, PowerPoint is becoming quite versatile in the kind of information it can depict and very flexible in its usage. The slide orientations are invaluable part of this improved list of PowerPoint features. Like most other applications PowerPoint supports two orientations: landscape and portrait. The Landscape layout is the default PowerPoint layout and it is probably the more commonly used one. In the landscape layout, the longer edge is horizontal so the slides align better with the screens and projectors. The Portrait layout is where the shorter edge is horizontal. This is sometimes better for print depending on the kind of content you want to present. Slide orientations in PowerPoint can be changed from the Design ribbon using the Slide Orientation command. Saving Presentation in Powerpoint 2010 One of the most basic tasks in PowerPoint is being able to save your work; this is probably the most important task as well. There are many users who have burnt their fingers for not saving their work in time and losing hours of hard work. The following are the basic steps to save a presentation. Step 1 ? Click on the File tab to launch the Backstage view and select Save. Step 2 ? In the Save As dialog, type in the file name and click "Save". Step 3 ? The default file format is .pptx. If you want to save the file with a different name, choose one of the file types from the "Save as type" dropdown list. If you are working on an already saved file, the "Save" option in the Backstage view will directly save the file in the existing format with the existing name. If you want to change the format or filename of an existing file, use the Save As option instead. Review Presentation in Powerpoint 2010 Reviewing the presentation can be a very powerful way of eliminating the errors and perfecting the slides. PowerPoint offers a wide range of reviewing options for you to use. Some of them are automatic or system driven, while others aid other users to collaborate and review the slides. All the reviewing tools are grouped under the Review ribbon. Review Section Functions Proofing Spellchecking ? Identify spelling and grammar based on selected language preference Research ? Reference language related research tools based on specific reference books and research sites Thesaurus ? Provide synonyms for selected text Language Translate ? Provides translation services for selected words for multilingual support Language ? Sets the default language for the presentation - this will be used as default language for proofing Comments Show Marking ? Show/hide the user comments in the slide New Comment ? Add new comment against the selected content Edit Comment ? Edit an existing comment Delete Comment ? Delete a selected comment, all comments in the selected slide or all the comments in the presentation Previous / Next Comment ? Move to previous / next comments Compare Compare ? Compare the current presentation with another presentation and identify the differences Accept/ Reject ? Accept or reject the differences to be incorporated into the current presentation Previous/ Next ? Move to the previous or the next difference in the comparison. End Review ? End the review and discard any unapplied changes Adding Slide Numbers in Powerpoint 2010 Just like you have page numbers for books, it is usually a good idea to add slide numbers to presentations. There are two ways you can add slide numbers to your presentation and this chapter will show you both those techniques. Step 1 ? Under the Insert ribbon, Text group click on Slide Number command. Step 2 ? The Header and Footer dialog opens up. Step 3 ? Check the Slide number check box. Step 4 ? The Preview shows the section where the slide number will be placed. Instead of clicking on the Slide Number command, you can also click on the Header & Footer menu item to launch the same dialog as in Step 2. Adding Header & Footer in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint offers the ability to add header and footers to the slides. While having footers in presentations is logical, header may not be quite evident at first. Typically, the slide title would be the header in the main slide, however when it comes to printing out handouts a separate header would be quite useful. Here are the steps to add header and footer information to slides Step 1 ? In the Insert ribbon, click on the Header & Footer menu item. Step 2 ? The Header and Footer dialog has two tabs  the Slide tab and the Notes and Handouts tab. Step 3 ? You can add details to the slide footer from the Slide tab. S.No Slide Footer Options & Description 1 Date and time Add date and time to the footer Specify the format of the date and time entered Set up the footer to update automatically or use a fixed number 2 Slide Number Insert Slide number in the footer 3 Footer Add designated text to the footer - a good example of this is the confidentiality clause or copyright clause 4 Don't show on title slide Decide on whether the footer information should be displayed on the title slide or not Step 4 ? You can add the details to the handouts from the Notes and Handouts tab. S.No Notes and Handouts Options & Description 1 Date and time Add date and time to the footer Specify the format of the date and time entered Set up the footer to update automatically or use a fixed number 2 Header Add the header information for every page on the handout 3 Page Number Insert page number in the footer 4 Footer Add designated text to the footer - a good example of this is the confidentiality clause or copyright clause When you check any of the header and footer checkboxes in either tabs, you can see the location where the detail is inserted in the preview section. Running Slide Show in Powerpoint 2010 Most PowerPoint presentations are created to be run as a slideshow. Given all the advanced features available in PowerPoint 2010, it is no surprise that there are many features related to running the slideshow that have been included in this program too. Most of these features are really to help you create a good slideshow without having to go through the entire presentation over and over again after every minor change. Features related to running the slideshow are grouped under the Slideshow ribbon. Section Menu Item Description Start Slideshow From Beginning Starts slideshow from beginning From Current Slide Starts slideshow from the current slide Broadcast Slideshow Allows users to broadcast the slideshows using Microsoft's PowerPoint Broadcast Service Custom Slideshow Builds a custom slideshow by picking the slides you want to run Set Up Set Up Slideshow Helps set up the slideshow including browser/ full screen display, show options with or without narration/ animation, pen and laser color during the slideshow and the slides to be presented during the show Hide Slide Helps mark/ unmark the slide as hidden, so it is skipped or shown during the slideshow respectively Rehearse Timing Allows users to rehearse the timing on each slide and the entire slideshow Record Slideshow Records the slideshow including narration and animation Slideshow Checkboxes Helps set or avoid the use of narrative audio and rehearsed timings during the show. Display media controls in the slideshow view Monitors Resolution Defines resolution in slideshow view Show Presentation on Picks the monitor to display the presentation one - in case of multiple monitors Use Presenter View Run presentation in Presenter view rather than just slideshow view Keyboard Shortcuts in Powerpoint 2010 Like the other windows based programs, PowerPoint 2010 also offers a wide range of keyboard shortcuts. For the current PowerPoint users, there is a major change in the way these shortcuts are being mapped in the 2010 release compared to some of the older ones. With a whole new range of features being added to PowerPoint, it is evident why there are so many changes to the keyboard shortcuts. We will understand how to read and figure out the shortcuts with ease. Step 1 ? The first step to access the keyboard shortcuts is to press the Alt key on your keyboard. This will display the first level of shortcuts indicated by alphabets or numbers as shown. For example, the shortcut to access the Home ribbon is 'H' and for saving the presentation, the shortcut is '1'. Step 2 ? Once you select the first level of shortcut, the second level of shortcuts for respective commands are shown. Notice that some of these shortcuts are disabled or displayed in a lighter shade than others. This is because the disabled shortcuts cannot be used in the current state. For example, all the font related commands are disabled as no text has been selected. If you execute the same steps after selecting a portion of text, these shortcuts will be enabled too. In some cases, there are two alphabets associated with a single shortcut; in such cases, you need to key in both of them immediately after another to get the desired effect. Get Context Help in Powerpoint 2010 Despite getting a good grasp of the program, we may need help on the different aspects from time to time. To aid in such scenarios, PowerPoint has created the Context Help feature. With this feature, if you get stuck in any dialog, you can press F1 and PowerPoint will open the help topic related to that dialog. This is extremely beneficial as you need not spend time trying to browse through all the help topics just to get to the one you need. The context help is based on the active window and not on the object you have selected. So if you select an image and press F1, you will get the generic help windows as your active window is still the main PowerPoint program. If you select any other dialog or window, PowerPoint context help will show the related help topic when you press F1. If you continue to work only with the ribbon options on the screen, the context help would not work. But if you right-click on the shapes or objects and open the related editing dialogs, you can press F1 and can learn more about the related functionalities of those shapes and objects. Copy and Paste Content in Powerpoint 2010 In this chapter, we will understand how to copy and paste content in PowerPoint 2010. PowerPoint offers to the users a wide range of options when it comes to duplicating content. PowerPoint has the standard cut and copy functions but allows variations of paste options. Cut Option This option allows you to cut content from the slide - this means the original content is being moved to a different location hence the content will be deleted from its original location when you use this option. To cut a content, you need to select it and press "Ctrl + X" or right-click on the selected content and select Cut. Copy Option This option allows you to copy content from one location to another; hence the original content is retained it its place while the duplicate content can be pasted. To copy a portion of content, you need to select it and press "Ctrl + C" or right-click on the selected content and select Copy. Paste Option This option allows you to paste the cut or copied content at the desired location. There are multiple paste options for you to choose from. These options are indicated by different icons when you right-click at the desired location. Even if you do not remember the icons, you can hover your cursor on top of them for tooltip explanations. The table below describes the paste options in PowerPoint. S.No Paste Option & Description 1 Destination Theme Pasted content adopts the destination theme. 2 Keep Source Formatting Pasted content retains the source formatting - available for table or Excel content. 3 Picture Content is pasted as an image - once pasted as an image, the content cannot be modified. 4 Keep Text Only Pastes just the text - available for table or Excel content. You can also paste content using "Ctrl + V". In this case, you can make changes to the pasted object by pressing the Ctrl key to get access to the paste options. Note that these options are available only immediately after pasting. If you perform some other action, you will not be able to make changes based on the paste options. Find & Replace Content in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint offers its users the ability to search for specific text and if required replace it automatically. This is a very useful tool when you need to review a very large presentation or correct the same error in multiple places in the slide. Given below are the steps to find and replace text in PowerPoint. Although, you can only use this function for text, the text itself can be present in a text box, in another shape, as a WordArt, in SmartArt or tables. Finding Content The following steps will show you how to find content in PowerPoint. Step 1 ? In the Home tab, under the Editing section click on Find. Step 2 ? Type the text you want to search in the "Find what:" field. Step 3 ? You can narrow your search by selecting "Match Case" - to find exact case match - and "Find whole words only" - to find whole words and not words where typed word is just a part of the word. Step 4 ? Press on "Find Next" to find the next occurrence of the search word. Step 5 ? The Find dialog does not disappear after finding the first instance, so you can keep pressing "Find Next" multiple times till you reach the end of the search. At this point, you will receive a message from PowerPoint indicating the end of the search. Replacing Content Here are the steps to replace content in PowerPoint. Step 1 ? In the Home tab, under the Editing section click on the Replace button. Step 2 ? Type the text you want to replace in the "Find what:" field and the replaced text in "Replace with:" field Step 3 ? You can narrow your search by selecting "Match Case" - to find the exact case match - and "Find whole words only" - to find the whole words and not words where typed word is just a part of the word. Step 4 ? Press on "Find Next" to find the next occurrence of the search word. PowerPoint will show you the next occurrence and you can then click on "Replace" to replace the word. If you want to skip the occurrence, you can press "Find Next" again without pressing "Replace" Step 5 ? The Replace dialog does not disappear after finding the first instance, so you can keep pressing "Find Next" multiple times till you reach the end of the search. At this point, you will receive a message from PowerPoint indicating the end of the search. Undo Edited Changes in Powerpoint 2010 Like any other program, there are times when you may want to undo some of the changes you made to the slides. PowerPoint offers the "Undo/ Redo" option to facilitate this. While working with the "Undo/ Redo" options, you must remember that these will always be sequential which means you can only undo actions in the order they were executed. You cannot undo the last action, retain the remaining 10 actions and undo the eleventh one. If you want to undo the eleventh action, all the subsequent 10 actions will also be undone. To undo the last action, click on the Undo button in the PowerPoint Quick Access bar. You can keep clicking on this button repeatedly to undo the series of actions; however a more graceful way of undoing multiple actions is to use the dropdown next to the undo button. Here you can select the list of actions you want to undo by sliding your cursor on top of the actions and click on them. Redo is an option available only after you have undone at least one action. The redo follows the same logic as the undo option, except in the reverse order. You can click on the redo button one or more times to redo previously undone action in the sequence. You do not have the dropdown option with redo though. Spelling Check in Powerpoint 2010 One of the best proofing tools available in PowerPoint is the spelling check. This is an automated proofing feature which will review the entire presentation for errors. To use this feature, you need to first set the Proofing language from the Language section under the Review ribbon. In the Language dialog, you can select the language you want to use for your presentation. If you have some content selected, you can click OK and select it for just that section. If you want to use the selected language for the entire presentation you should click default. Once the proofing language is set you can see it at the bottom of the PowerPoint window. If there are proofing errors in the presentation, you will also see an icon of a book with a red cross on top of it. You can review the errors in the presentation by clicking on the red cross at the bottom of the window or by clicking on "Spelling" under the Proofing section in the Review ribbon. From the Spelling dialog, you can take the necessary actions to ignore, correct or edit the errors in the presentation. The table below describes the various options you have in the Spelling dialog. S.No Spelling Dialog Option & Description 1 Ignore Ignores the error for the current instance. 2 Ignore All Ignores the error for all the instances in the presentation. 3 Change Accepts the suggested change for the current instance. 4 Change All Accepts the suggested change for all the instances in the presentation. 5 Add Uses the first suggested word each time you click Add. 6 Suggest Includes this word in the PowerPoint dictionary. 7 AutoCorrect Automatically corrects similar errors going forward. 8 Close Closes the Spelling dialog. 9 Options Sets up how PowerPoint should proof the presentation.

Duplicating Content in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint is a multi-content program that supports many non-text content types like shapes, charts, pictures, clip arts, SmartArt and multimedia files. While working with the content, it may sometimes be required to duplicate the content as part of the presentation development. PowerPoint offers options to duplicate the non-text content using the cutcopy-paste features. Cut-Paste Procedure In this procedure, the original content is moved to a different location.

The Picture option just pastes the content as an image with original settings. Once pasted as a picture you cannot change the parameters of the original content; for example, if you pasted a chart as an image, you cannot edit the data on the chart image. Special Characters in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint supports the insertion of special characters. This allows the users to adjust the font characteristics of these characters just like any other text giving them greater flexibility in terms of the presentation design.

Apply Formatting in Powerpoint 2010 One of the most powerful tools in Microsoft Office is the application of formatting feature. This feature basically lets you define the right format once and apply the same to a series of objects in the rest of the presentation or any other file.

Once you have the text within the shape you can format the text using the font related features available in PowerPoint. Arrange Shapes/Images in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint supports multiple content types and invariably different contents coexist in a slide. While it is ideal to have each content standout separately, there are times when you cannot do that or when overlapping of content is desirable. In such cases, it is important that you can determine which content stays on top of which one. PowerPoint has arrangement features to help achieve this goal. While working with arrangement features, you must think of each content as a separate layer and that these layers are laid over one another. To arrange the content, you must basically play with these layers. The following steps will help you arrange content in a presentation slide. Step 1 ? Select one of the contents and go the Arrange group under the Format ribbon. Step 2 ? Click on the Selection Pane to open the Selection and Visibility sidebar. Step 3 ? Select one of the rows in the sidebar to highlight the corresponding content in the slide. Step 4 ? Use the reordering arrows in the sidebar to move the content layer up or down. Step 5 ? Click on the eye next to each content in the sidebar to toggle its visibility on the slide. Instead of using the Selection Pane option, you can also right-click on the content to move it up or down. When you right-click, besides moving the layers by one step at a time using Bring Forward or Send Backward, you can also move the content directly to the top or bottom using Bring to Front or Send to Back respectively. Group/Ungroup Objects in Powerpoint 2010 While working with PowerPoint, you might need to carry out a set of actions on a bunch of objects. PowerPoint allows you to group objects within a slide and apply the same action on all the objects simultaneously. This feature in PowerPoint is called grouping. The following steps will help you group and ungroup objects ? Step 1 ? Select a set of shapes or objects together. To select the objects, press the Ctrl key and select each object individually. If the objects are together, you can also click and drag the cursor to select them; however with the click and drag everything that falls within the selected area will be selected. Step 2 ? Go to the Arrange Group under the Format ribbon. Step 3 ? Click on Group under the Group menu item - this will group the objects and shapes into a single object. Step 4 ? Apply the common changes you want to make to these objects. Step 5 ? Even though the objects are grouped, you can still edit them individually if need be. Step 6 ? If you want to edit the shapes or objects individually, go back to the Group menu item and select Ungroup. Step 7 ? After making changes, if you want to regroup the objects as per original grouping, you select one of the objects and use the Regroup option under the Group menu. Adding Audio & Video in Powerpoint 2010 PowerPoint supports multimedia in the slides. You can add audio or video clips to the slides which can be played during the presentation. The following steps will help you add audio or video file to the slides. Step 1 ? Go to the Media group under the Insert ribbon Step 2 ?

Add & Format Tables Powerpoint 2010 One of the most powerful data representation techniques is the use of tables. Table allows information to be segregated making it easy to read. PowerPoint has features that let you add tables in slides and also format them to enhance their visual effects. What's more, these tables are also compatible with Microsoft Excel, so you can basically take a spreadsheet or a section of a spreadsheet and paste it into a slide as a table. The following steps will help you add a table in PowerPoint. Step 1 ? Go to the Tables group under the Insert ribbon. Step 2 ? Click on the dropdown and select your table dimension from the matrix.
