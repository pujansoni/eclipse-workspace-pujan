Large data sets can be analyzed on the fly using versatile visualizations in Power View. The data visualizations are dynamic, thus facilitating ease of presentation of the data with a single Power View report. Power View is based on the Data Model in your workbook. Either you can start with a Data Model that is already available in Power Pivot or you can create a Data Model from Power View itself. In this tutorial, we assume that you are aware of the Data Model concepts in Power Pivot. Otherwise, we suggest you to go through the Excel Power Pivot tutorial first. Creating Power View To create a Power View, first you need to make sure that the Power View add-in is enabled in your Excel. You can then create a Power View sheet that contains Power View, which can hold several different data visualizations based on your Data Model. You will learn how to create a Power View sheet and Power View in the chapter - Creating a Power View. Understanding Power View Sheet The Power View sheet has several components such as Power View canvas, Filters area, Power View Fields list, Power View Layout areas and Power View tabs on the Ribbon. You will learn about these components in the chapter – Understanding Power View Sheet. Power View Visualizations The core of the Power View is in its various types of data visualizations that will enable you to portray the data, visualize, and explore, all in a dynamic mode. You can handle large data sets spanning several thousands of data on the fly switching from one visualization to another, drilling up and drilling down the data displaying the essence of the data. The different Power View visualizations that you can have are the following ? Table Matrix Card Charts Line Chart Bar Chart Column Chart Scatter Chart Bubble Chart Map You will learn about these visualizations in different chapters in this tutorial. You will also learn about combination of visualizations on a Power View and their interactive nature. Visualization with Multiples Another domain of Power View is its facility to visualize the Chart visualizations in Multiples. You can have a grid of Charts in Power View with the same axis. You can have Horizontal Multiples or Vertical Multiples. You will learn Multiples in Power View with different types of charts in the chapter - Visualization with Multiples. Visualization with Tiles When you have large data to display at a time, browsing up and down could take time. Power View makes this task very easy for you with Tiles. Tiles are containers on a navigation strip that is based on a field in your data. Clicking on a Tile is equivalent to selecting that value of the field and your visualization is filtered accordingly. You can have data bound images such as sport images for Tiles that will give a visual cue to your navigation strip. You will learn about Tiles in the chapter – Visualization with Tiles. Advanced Features in Power View Whenever you have to create a visualization, you need to first create a Table and then switch visualization to the required one. This would make you create the Tables several times during data exploration and reporting. Even after you decide on what fields to portray in your visualizations, you have to repeatedly select all these fields every time. Power View provides you with an advanced feature to define a default field set that enable you to select all the fields with a single click on the table name in the Power View Fields list. You can set table behavior, filter all the visualizations together with the VIEW tab in filters, change the sort order of a field, filter visualizations with Slicers, add data labels and add a title to the Power View. You will learn about these and more in the chapter – Advanced Features in Power View. Power View and Data Model We said Power View is based on the Data Model. You can either work on the Data Model that is already present, as is the case in all the previous chapters, or create one from the Power View sheet. You will learn about adding data tables to Data Model, creating relationships between tables and modifying Data Model from Power View sheet in the chapter – Power View and Data Model. Hierarchies in Power View If you data has nested fields you can define a hierarchy so that you can treat all the nested fields as one field. You can have a defined hierarchy in the Data Model that you can visualize from Power View or you can create a hierarchy in Power View and use it for visualization. You can drill p and drill down the hierarchy in Matrix, Bar Chart, Column Chart and Pie Chart visualizations. You can filter hierarchy in Pie Chart with Column Chart. You will learn all these in the chapter – Hierarchies in Power View. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Power View Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) enable you to track the progress against the set goals. You can create KPIs in the Data Model from Power View. You can then create appealing Power View visualizations that depict the KPIs and produce aesthetic reports. You can also edit the KPIs from Power View as it is possible that the KPIs might have to be modified as the time progresses. You will learn about KPIs in the chapter - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Power View. The chapter also has a brief introduction on KPIs, KPI parameters and how to identify KPIs. But, note that this is not exhaustive as KPIs depend on the field you have chosen to track the progress – for e.g. business performance, sales, HR, etc Formatting a Power View Report The Power View visualizations as you learn throughout the tutorial are ready to present any time, as they are all appealing and presentable. Because of the dynamic nature of the visualizations, it is easy to display the required results on the sport without much effort or time. As everything is visual, there will not be any need to preview the results. Hence, in Power View reporting is not the final step and can be at any point of time with your Power View and visualizations. In the chapter – Formatting a Power View Report, you will learn some more features that can change the look and feel of your already appealing Power View reports. These include changing Theme, setting background image, changing background colors, font and text size, formatting numbers and changing number aggregates. Sharing Your Work You can share your work with the concerned as the Power View sheets in your Excel workbook itself on server / cloud by giving appropriate permissions to read /edit. As Power View is also available on SharePoint, you can share your Power View reports as SharePoint reports. You can print Power View sheets, but as they are static, it would not make much sense to print them because of their innate powerful features of interactivity and dynamic nature. You can publish Power View sheets to Power BI. Data Acknowledgements The data that is used to the maximum extent is the Olympics results data for the years 1900 – 2014. The data table has around 35,000 rows of data that could reveal the power features of the optimistic Data Model and Power View visualizations. Sincere thanks to all those involved in providing this data onsite ? Olympics Official Results ? https://www.olympic.org/olympic-games Olympics Sport Images ? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia Last but not the least Microsoft Office Support that gave the idea of choosing Olympics data to render the power of Power View Visualizations. Excel Power View - Creation Power View is like a canvas on which you can have any number of visualizations based on your Data Model. You need to start with creating a Power View sheet and then add fields from the data tables to Power View to visualize and explore data. Before you start your data exploration with Power View, make sure that the Power View add-in enabled and available on the Ribbon. Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon. Power View should be visible on the Ribbon in the Reports group. Enabling Power View Add-in If you do not find Power View on the Ribbon, you need to enable the Power View add-in. Click the File tab on the Ribbon. Click Options. Click Add-Ins in the Excel Options dialog box. Click the drop-down arrow in the Manage box. Select COM Add-ins from the dropdown list and click Go. The COM Add-ins dialog box appears. Check the box Power View and click OK. Power View will be visible on the Ribbon. Creating a Power View Sheet You can create a Power View from the data tables in the Data Model. Suppose you have the following Data Model in your workbook. To create a Power View sheet, do the following ? Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon in Excel window. Click Power View in the Reports group. Opening Power View message box appears with a horizontally scrolling green status bar. This might take a little while. The Power View sheet is created as a worksheet in your Excel workbook. It contains an empty Power View area, Filters area and the Power View Fields list displaying the tables in the Data Model. Power View appears as a tab on the Ribbon in the Power View sheet. You will understand these different parts of the Power View sheet in the next chapter. Creating a Power View In this section, you will understand how to create a Power View in the Power View sheet. Suppose you want to display the medals that each country has won. Select the fields Country and Medal from the Results table. These two fields appear under FIELDS in the Areas. Power View will be displayed as a Table with the two selected fields as columns. As you can see, Power View is displaying which medals each country has won. Click the Title of the Power View sheet. Type Medals. Excel Power View - Sheet In the previous chapter, you have created a Power View sheet and a Power View on the Power View sheet. Note that you can create multiple Power Views on a Power View sheet. They are called Visualizations. You will learn about the various different visualizations that you can create on a Power View sheet in the subsequent chapters. Before you learn about the different visualizations, you need to understand the various parts of the Power View sheet. Power View Sheet Layout The Power View sheet layout looks as follows ? You can find the following different parts on the Power View sheet. Power View Area. Power View Visualizations. Power View Title. Power View Fields List. Filters. Power View Area Power View area is like a canvas on which you can create multiple different visualizations based on the data in the Data Model. You can have multiple visualizations in the Power View area and work on them either collectively or separately. To create a new visualization, you need to click on an empty part of the Power View area, and select the fields that you want to display in the visualization. Power View Visualizations The variety of visualizations that Power View provides is the strength of Power View. You can have any number of visualizations on the Power View area and each with different size and different layout. For example, you can have a Table visualization, a Chart visualization and a Map visualization on a single Power View. The fields that are displayed in the visualizations can be individually chosen. The sizes of the visualizations can be different. To resize a visualization, do the following ? Click on the symbol in the top right corner, or Click on the symbol in the bottom right corner and pull the arrow that appears Pop out and Pop in You can make a visualization to occupy the entire Power View area with the Pop out button that appears on the top right corner of the visualization. Move the cursor to the Table visualization. Move to the top right corner of the Table visualization. The Pop out button is highlighted. Click the Pop out button. The Table visualization pops out to the entire Power View area. The Pop out button changes to Pop in button. Click the Pop in button. The Table visualization reverts to the original size. Power View Fields List The Power View Fields list displays all the tables in the Data Model and the corresponding fields. By selecting the fields, you can display the required data in a visualization. Note that you can choose different fields for the different visualizations on a Power View sheet. This makes Power View a versatile and collective tool to visualize the different aspects of the data in the Data Model. While the selected fields in the Power View Fields list determine what data is to be displayed in a visualization, the areas below the Fields list determine how the data is to be displayed. For example, you might choose to display the fields - Country, Sport, Gender, and Medal Count in the visualization. While placing these fields in the Areas, you can opt to display Gender as a Legend. You will learn the different types of Areas and the way they can change the layout of a visualization in the subsequent chapters. Title The Title in a Power View sheet is for the entire sheet. Therefore, while giving a Title, see to that it meets the objective of the entire Power View report. Filters The Filters area allows you to filter the fields for specific data that is to be displayed. You can choose to apply a filter to the entire View, i.e. all the visualizations or only the selected visualization. Click Table visualization. As you can observe, the Filters area has two tabs – VIEW and TABLE. If you click the tab TABLE and apply the filters to fields, only the data in the selected TABLE visualization will be filtered. If you click on the tab VIEW and apply the filters to fields, the data in all the visualizations in the Power View sheet will be filtered. If the visualization is other than Table, say Matrix, then the tabs in the Filters area will be VIEW and MATRIX. You will learn about Filters in detail in the chapter - Combination of Power View Visualizations. Power View Tabs on the Ribbon Power View has three tabs on the Ribbon ? Power View, Design, and Layout. When you create a Power View Sheet, the tab – POWER VIEW is added to the Ribbon. When you create a Power View (visualization) such as Table visualization and click it, the tab – DESIGN is added to the Ribbon. When you switch visualization to a Chart or Map, the tab – LAYOUT is added to the Ribbon. Excel Power View - Visualizations Power View is an interactive data exploration and visualization tool in Excel. Power View supports various visualizations such as Tables, Matrices, Cards, Charts such as Bar, Column, Scatter, Line, Pie and Bubble Charts and Maps. You can also create sets of multiple charts (charts with same axis) in Power View. In this chapter, you will understand each Power View visualization briefly. You will understand the details in the subsequent chapters. Table Visualization For every visualization that you want to create on a Power View sheet, you have to start by creating a Table first. You can then quickly switch among the visualizations to find the one that best suits your data. The Table looks like any other data table with columns representing fields and rows representing data values. You can select and deselect fields in the Power View Fields list to choose the fields that are to be displayed in the Table. Switch Visualization Once you create a Table visualization that is default, you can convert it into any other visualization as follows ? Click on Table visualization. Two tabs, POWER VIEW and DESIGN appear on the Ribbon. Click the DESIGN tab. There are several visualization options in the Switch Visualization group on the Ribbon. You can choose any of these options. Matrix Visualization Matrix Visualization is similar to a Table Visualization as it also contains rows and columns of data. However, a matrix has some additional features such as displaying the data without repeating values, displaying totals and subtotals by columns and/or rows, drill down/drill up a hierarchy, etc. Card Visualization In a card visualization, you will have a series of snapshots that display the data from each row in the table, laid out like an index card. Chart Visualizations In Power View, you have a number of Chart options: Bar, Column, Line, Scatter, Bubble, and Pie. Map Visualization If your data has fields pertaining to geography, you can use Maps in Power View to display the values. Maps in Power View use Bing map tiles and hence you need to make sure that you are online when you are displaying a Map visualization. You can use Pie Charts for data points in a Map Visualization. Excel Power View - Table Visualization In Power View, for every visualization you want to create, you start by creating a Table, which is the default and then convert the Table to other visualizations easily. The Table looks like any other data table with columns representing fields and rows representing data values. You can select and deselect fields in the Power View Fields list to choose the fields that are to be displayed in the Table. The fields can be from the same data table or from different related data tables. Creating a Table To create a Table in Power View, do the following ? Click on the Power View area. Click on the table – Results in the Power View Fields list. Select the fields Country, Sport, and Medal. A Table will be displayed on Power View with selected fields as columns, containing the actual values. Understanding Table Visualization You can see that the selected fields appear in the FIELDS area under the Power View Fields list. The columns are formatted according to their data type, as defined in the data model that the report is based on. The order of the fields in the FIELDS area represents the order of the columns in the Table. You can change the order by dragging the fields in the FIELDS area. You can sort the Table by any column by clicking on the column name. The sort order can be ascending or descending by values. You can filter the data in the Table by choosing the filtering options in the Filters area, under the Table tab. You can add fields to the Table by dragging the field either to the Table in Power View or to the FIELDS area. If you drag a field to the Power View area and not to the Table, a new Table is displayed. Adding a Field to Table as Count Suppose you want to display the Medal Count as a column. You can do it by adding the field Medal to the Table as Count. Click the arrow next to the field, Medal, in the Power View Fields list. Select Add to Table as Count from the dropdown list. A new column Count of Medal will be added to the Table, displaying the Medal Count values. Adding a Count Field to Table As your data has more than 34000 rows, adding the field Medal as Count to the Table is not an efficient approach, as Power View has to do the calculation whenever you change the layout of the Table. The more effective way is to add a calculated field to the Medals data table in the Data Model. Click on the PowerPivot tab on the Ribbon. Click on Manage in the Data Model group. The tables in the Data Model will be displayed. Click on the Results tab. In the Results table, in the calculation area, in the cell below the Medal column, type the following DAX formula Medal Count:=COUNTA([Medal]) You can see that the medal count formula appears in the formula bar and to the left of the formula bar, the column name Medal is displayed. In the Power View sheet, you will get a Power View message that the Data Model is changed and if you click OK, the changes will be reflected in your Power View. Click OK. In the Power View Fields list, you can observe the following ? A new field Medal Count is added in the Results table. A calculator icon appears adjacent to the field Medal Count, indicating that it is a calculated field. Select the fields – Country, Sport, and Medal Count. Your Power View Table displays the medal count country wise and sport wise. Filtering Table in Power View You can filter the values displayed in the Table by defining the filter criteria. Click the TABLE tab in the Filters area. Click Medal Count. Click the icon Advanced filter mode to the right of Medal Count. Select is greater than or equal to from the dropdown list under Show items for which the value. Type 100 in the box below that and then click Apply Filter. The Table will display only those records with Medal Count >= 100. Excel Power View - Matrix Visualization Matrix visualization is similar to a Table visualization in that it also contains rows and columns of data. However, a Matrix has additional features such as hierarchy, not repeating values, etc. As you have learnt in the previous chapters, you need to start with a Table and then convert it to Matrix. Choose the fields – Country, Sport, and Medal Count. A Table representing these fields appears in Power View. Switching to Matrix Visualization Convert the Table to Matrix as follows ? Click on the Table. Click the DESIGN tab. Click Table in the Switch Visualization group. Select Matrix from the dropdown list. The Table is converted to Matrix. Advantages of Matrix Visualization A Matrix has the following advantages ? It can display the data without repeating values. It can display totals and subtotals by columns and/or rows. If it contains a hierarchy, you can drill down/drill up. It can be collapsed and expanded by rows and/or columns. Combination of Table and Matrix Visualizations You can see the differences between the Table and Matrix visualizations by having them side by side on the Power View sheet, displaying the same data. Follow the steps given below ? Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport, Event, and Medal Count. In the Table, the values of country repeated for several sport values and the values of sport are repeated for several event values. Create another Table on the right side of the first Table as follows ? Click on the Power View sheet in the space to the right of the Table. Select the fields – Country, Sport, Event, and Medal Count. Another Table representing these fields appears in Power View, to the right of the earlier Table. Click the Table on the right. Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon. Click Table in the Switch Visualization group. Select Matrix from the dropdown list. The Table on the right in Power View is converted to Matrix. As you can observe, the Matrix displays each country and sport only once, without repeating values as is the case in Table. Filtering Matrix in Power View You can explore the data to find the countries and the corresponding sports and events with medal count of more than 150. Click on the Table. In the Filters area, click the TABLE tab. Set the filtering criteria for Medal Count as - is greater than or equal to 150. Click Apply filter Click Matrix. In the Filters area, click the MATRIX tab. Set the filtering criteria for Medal Count as - is greater than or equal to 150. Click Apply filter. In Matrix, data is displayed without repeating the values, whereas in Table data is displayed with repeated values. Totals To understand the capability of Matrix in displaying Subtotals and Totals, do the following ? Add the fields Country, Sport, Event and Medal Count to Matrix. As you can see, the fields – Country, Sport, and Event define the hierarchy and are nested in that order. Matrix also displays Subtotals at each of these Levels as shown below. The Subtotals and Total are given as follows ? Medal Count is at the Event Level. Subtotal at the Sport Level – Sum of the Medal Count values of all Events in that Sport won by the Country that is one Level up. Subtotal at the Country Level – Sum of the Subtotals at Sport Level. At the bottom of the Matrix, the Total row is displayed that sums up all the Medal Count values. Look at a variation of the same Matrix ? Add the fields Country, Sport, and Medal Count to Matrix. Filter the Matrix to display only values with Medal Count more than 250. The Medal Count values are displayed as follows ? At Sport Level ? Total Medal Count of all the Medal Counts at Event Levels in the Sport. At Country Level ? Subtotal of all the Medal Count values at Sport Levels in the Country. Total Row ? Total of all the Subtotals of all the Countries. If you do not want to display the Subtotals and Total rows in Matrix, do the following ? Click on the Matrix. Click the DESIGN tab. Click Totals in the Options group. Select None from the dropdown list. Totals will not be displayed. To display the Subtotals and total again, do the following Click on the Matrix. Click the DESIGN tab. Click Totals in the Options group. Select Rows from the dropdown list. The Rows with Subtotals and Total will be displayed. As you can see, this is the default mode in Matrix. Excel Power View - Card Visualization In a Card visualization, you will have a series of snapshots that display the data from each row in the table, laid out like an index card. Consider the Data Model, where we have added the table SportPics. You need to start with a Table and then convert it to Card. Choose the fields ? Country, Sport, SportImage and Medal Count. The Table representing these fields appears in Power View. Filter the Table to display data with Medal Count more than 275. The values in the column SportImage are images. It is possible to add images to your Power View visualizations. The images are data bound, i.e. a sport image is linked to the corresponding sport. You will learn more about images in subsequent chapters. Switching to Card Visualization Convert the Table to a Card as follows ? Click on the Table. Click the DESIGN tab. Click Table in the Switch Visualization group. Select Card from the dropdown list. The Table is converted to Card visualization. Card Style You have two Card Styles for Card visualization. Card Callout The Card Style that you have in the previous section is Card, is the default style. To convert the Card Style to Callout do the following ? Click on the Card. Click the Design tab on the Ribbon. Click Card Style in the Options group. Select Callout from the dropdown list. The Card Style changes from Card to Callout. In the Callout Card Style, all the text is displayed in large font. You can change the Card Style back to Card as follows ? Click on Card Style. Select Card from the dropdown list. Excel Power View - Chart Visualizations In Power View, you have a number of Chart options. The Charts in Power View are interactive. Further, the Charts are interactive in a presentation setting also, which would enable you to highlight the analysis results interactively. In this chapter, you will have an overview of the Chart visualizations. You will learn them in detail in the subsequent chapters. Types of Chart Visualizations In Power View, you have the following types of Chart visualizations ? Line Bar Column Scatter Bubble Pie Line, Bar and Column Charts You can use Line, Bar and Column charts for comparing data points in one or more data series. Line Chart In a Line Chart, categories are along the horizontal axis and values along the vertical axis. Bar Chart In a Bar Chart, categories are along the vertical axis and values along the horizontal axis. Column Chart In a Column Chart, categories are along the horizontal axis and values along the vertical axis. Scatter and Bubble Charts You can use Scatter Charts and Bubble Charts to display many related data in one Chart. In Scatter Charts and Bubble Charts, the x-axis displays one numeric field and the y-axis displays another. In Bubble Charts, a third numeric field controls the size of the data points. Scatter Chart ? A scatter chart is shown below ? Bubble Chart ? A bubble chart is shown below ? Pie Charts In a Pie Chart, the numeric field can be shown by the Pie slice size, and categories by colors. In Power View, Pie Charts can be simple or sophisticated. In a sophisticated Pie Chart, you can have the following additional features ? Drill down when you double-click a Pie slice. Show sub-slices within the larger Pie slices. Pie Chart ? A Pie chart is shown below ? Interactive Nature of Chart Visualizations The Charts in Power View are interactive. If you click on a value in one Chart ? That value in that Chart is highlighted. That value in all the other Charts in Power View is also highlighted. All the Tables, Matrices and Tiles in Power View are filtered to that value. You will learn more about this and other additional interactive features such as Play Axis, Colors, and Tiles in subsequent chapters. Excel Power View - Line Chart Visualization Line Charts are used for comparing data points in one or more data series. Line Charts distribute category data evenly along the horizontal (category) axis, and all numerical value data along the vertical (value) axis. As you are aware from the previous chapters, you need to start with a Table and then convert it to Line Chart. Select the fields – Country and Medal Count. By default, Table will be displayed. Switching to Line Chart Visualization Convert the Table to Line Chart as follows ? Click on the Table. Click the DESIGN tab. Click Other Chart in the Switch Visualization group. Select Line from the dropdown list. The Table is converted to Line Chart. The category data is displayed along the horizontal axis and numerical value data along the vertical axis.

Excel Power View - Advanced Features In the previous chapters you have learnt about the different possible Power View visualizations, Multiples and Tiles. The fields you select for display in the visualizations depend on what you want to explore, analyze and present. For example, in most of the visualizations that you have seen so far, we have chosen Medal to analyze Medal Count by medal type. You might want to explore, analyze and present the data gender-wise. In such a case, you need to choose the field Gender. Further, visualization also depends on the data you are displaying. Throughout this tutorial, we have chosen Olympics data in order to visualize the power of Power View, the ease with which you can handle large data and switch over different visualizations on the fly. However, your data set might be different. You need to choose a visualization that best suits your data. If you are not sure about the suitability, you can just play around with the visualizations to choose the right one as switching across the visualizations is quick and simple in Power View. Moreover, you can also do it in the presentation view, in order to answer any queries that can arise during a presentation. You have also seen how you can have a combination of visualizations in a Power View and the interactive nature of the visualizations. You will learn advanced features in Power View in this chapter. These features come handy for reporting. Creating a Default Field Set for Table You might have to use the same field set for different visualizations in a Power View. As you are aware, to display any visualization, you need to create a Table visualization first. If the fields for the Table visualization are from the same data table, you can create a default field set for Table so that you can select the default field set with one click, instead of selecting the fields for the Table visualization repeatedly. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click Manage in the Data Model group. The Power Pivot window appears ? Click the tab – Results to display the Results data table in the Power Pivot window. Click the Advanced tab on the Ribbon. Click Default Field Set in the Reporting Options group. The Default Field Set dialog box appears. Click the Fields you want to select holding down the Ctrl key in the Fields in the table box. Click Add. The selected fields appear in the Default fields, in order box on the right side. Click the Move Up or Move Down buttons to order the fields in the Default fields, in order box and click OK. Click on the Power View sheet in the Excel window. A message ‘Data Model is changed’ appears and click OK to make those changes in Power View. Click on the data table name – Results in the Power View Fields list. Table visualization with the default field set appears in Power View Note that you have to click only on the data table name in the Power View Fields list to select the default field set. If you click on the arrow next to data table name, it expands showing all the fields in the data table and in Power View, Table visualization does not appear. Click in the empty space to the right of Table visualization in Power View. Click on the data table name - Results in the Power View Fields list. Another Table visualization with the default field set appears in Power View. As you can see, you are able to create a Table visualization with 5 fields in the desired order with a single click using the default field set. This eliminates the cumbersome selection of the 5 fields in the desired order with 5 clicks each time you want to display a Table (or any other) visualization. However, you should be sure of which fields should be in the default field set in a data table. Hence, this feature can be used after data exploration, visualization is complete, and you are ready to produce reports. You might have to produce several reports, in which case this feature comes handy. Setting Table Behavior You can set the default table behavior that Power View uses to create report labels automatically for the data table. This becomes useful when you create visualizations from the same data table, perhaps for many different reports. Suppose you have a data table – Olympics Results in the Data Model Click on the data table Olympics Results in the Power Pivot window. Click the Advanced tab on the Ribbon. Click Table Behavior in the Reporting Options group. The Table Behavior dialog box appears Select EventID under the Row Identifier box. This column should have unique values in the data table. Check the boxes Event and EventID in the Keep Unique Rows box. These columns should have row values that are unique, and should not be aggregated when creating Power View reports. Select Sport in the Default Label box. Select SportImage in the Default Image box. Click OK. To visualize the Table behavior that you have set, select the fields as follows ? Click on Power View. Select the fields – Sport, SportImage, Event, Year, Athlete, Country and Medal in that order. By default, Table visualization appears. Switch visualization to Card. The Sport field values are larger than the other field values and appear as headings for the Cards. This is because you have set Sport as the Default Label in the Table Behavior dialog box. Further, you have set SportImage as the Default Image that appears on each Card based on the Sport value. Filtering Values in a View Suppose you have three Power View visualizations – Matrix, Stacked Column Chart and sophisticated Pie Chart in the same Power View, each displaying different aspects of data. You can see that all the three visualizations are displaying data for all the Country values. Suppose you want to display data only for USA, URS and JPN. You can apply the filter criteria on the field Country in View rather than in each visualization separately. Click in the Filters area. Click the VIEW tab. The Filters area will be empty and no fields will be displayed, as you have not yet selected any. Drag the field Country from Power View Fields list to Filters area. The field Country with all the values appears in the Filters area. Check the boxes - USA, URS and JPN. You can see that all the visualizations in the Power View were filtered at once. Adding Title to Power View The Title in the Power View is common to all visualizations. Hence, it should be meaningful across the visualizations. At the top of the Power View, you will see – Click here to add a title. Click the placeholder and type Medal Count for JPN, URS and USA. Click the Text tab on the Ribbon and format the Title. Adding Data Labels in a Chart Visualization You can add Data Labels in a Chart visualization. Click on the Clustered Column Chart. Click the LAYOUT tab on the Ribbon. Click Data Labels in the Labels group. Select Show from the dropdown list. Data Labels appear in the Column Chart. Interactive Data Visualization in Power View The efficiency of Power View is in its ability to make you visualize data interactively within no time. Click on the Pie Chart. Drag Medal from COLOR area to SLICES area. Drag Country from Power View Fields list to COLOR area. The Pie Chart shows Country values – JPN, URS and USA as you have applied this filter to VIEW. Click on the Pie Slice – USA, Gold. The Matrix is filtered to show only the values corresponding to the highlighted Pie Slice. In the Column Chart, the distribution of Gold Medals among Men and Women is highlighted for USA. Thus, efficient presentations with Power View is just a click away. Changing the Sort Order of a Field As you are aware, each field will have default sort order. In the visualizations that you have seen so far, the Medal field is sorted by the default order – Bronze, Gold, and Silver. This is because the text field is sorted in ascending order. However, while reporting, you might want to display the order as Gold, Silver and Bronze as it would be more appealing. Add a field by which you can sort the Medal field in the desired order as follows ? Create a new worksheet in your workbook. Create an Excel table as given below. Name the table as Medal_Position. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click on Add to Data Model in the Tables group. The table Medal_Position will be added to Data Model as a data table. Create a relationship between the data tables Results and Medal Position with the field Medal. Add the field Medal Position to Results data table as follows ? Click on the Data View in the Power Pivot window. Click the Results tab. Click the Design tab on the Ribbon. Click Add. The Add Column on the extreme right of the data table will be highlighted. Type the following DAX formula in the formula bar and press Enter. =RELATED(Medal_Position[Medal Position]) A new column will be added to the Results data table. The header of the column would be Calculated Column1. Change the column header to Medal Position by double clicking on it. As you can observe, the Medal Position column is filled as per the values in the Medal column and as defined in the Medal_Position data table. Specify how Power View should sort the Medal field as follows ? Select the Medal column. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon. Click Sort by Column in the Sort and Filter group. Select Sort by Column from the dropdown list. The Sort by Column dialog box appears. Ensure Medal is in the Sort Column box. Select Medal Position in the By Column box. Click OK. The visualizations will be updated automatically to the new sort order. Filtering Visualizations with Slicers You can filter Power View visualizations with Slicers. Click on Power View next to the Map. Drag the field Gender from Power View Fields list to Power View. A Table appears by default. Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon. Click Slicer in the Slicer group. The table will be converted to a Slicer. When you click any of the options in the Slicer, the Map will immediately reflect the selection. Click Men. Now click Women. You can have any number of Slicers in Power View. Click on the Map. Deselect the field Medal. Click Power View in any empty space. Drag the field Medal to Power View. The table appears by default. Click Slicer on the Ribbon. Another Slicer – Medal appears in Power View. You can have any combination of filters with the two Slicers. Click on Women in the Gender Slicer. Click on Gold in the Medal Slicer. You can clear a filter by clicking on the Clear Filter icon that looks like Eraser on the top right corner of the Slicer. Creating Interactive Bar and Column Charts You can have interactive Bar and Column Charts in a Power View. Create a Table with Country and Medal Count. Switch to Stacked Bar Chart. Create a Table with Sport and Medal Count. Switch to Stacked Column Chart. Add a Slicer for Gender. Add a Slicer for Season. Filter Stacked Bar Chart to display few Country values. Filter Stacked Column Chart to display few Sport values. You Power View looks as follows ? Click on Summer in Season Slicer. Click on Women in Gender Slicer. Click on Gold in the Legend. You can select any combination of the filters and display the results immediately. Excel Power View and Data Model Power View is based on the Data Model in your workbook that is created and managed by Power Pivot. You can access the Data Model from the Power Pivot window. Because of the optimization that Power Pivot uses in managing the Power Pivot window, you would be able to work with large data sets on the fly. Power View visualizations and their interactive features are possible because of the Data Model. You can also create and/or modify the Data Model from the Power View sheet in your workbook. For those readers for whom Data Model concepts in Excel are new, suggest to refer to Excel Power Pivot tutorial for the details. In this chapter, you will learn more about Power View and Data Model. Power View and Data Model You have learnt that Power View is based on the Data Model that is created and managed in Power Pivot window. You have also seen the Power of interactive visualizations that are based on large data such as Olympics data that is made part of the Data Model. When you have a Data Model in your workbook, whenever you create a Power View sheet, it automatically gets the data tables from the Data Model along with the relationships defined among them, so that you can select fields from the related data tables. If you have Excel tables in your workbook, you can link them to the data tables in the Data Model. However, if you have large data sets such as Olympics data, the Power View is optimized by directly creating the Data Model from the data source. Once you have the Data Model in your workbook and relationships defined among the tables, you are all set to visualize and explore data in Power View. You can refresh the data in the Data Model to update the modifications made in the data sources from where you have created the Data Model. Creating Data Model from Power View Sheet You can also create the Data Model directly from the Power View sheet as follows ? Start with a new workbook that contains Salesperson data and Sales data in two worksheets. Create a table from the range of data in the Salesperson worksheet and name it Salesperson. Create a table from the range of data in the Sales worksheet and name it Sales. You have two tables – Salesperson and Sales in your workbook. Click the Sales table in the Sales worksheet. Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon. Click Power View in the Reports group. A new Power View sheet will be created in your workbook. A Table visualization appears with all the fields in the Sales table. Note that you do not have a Data Model in your workbook. As you can observe in the Power View Fields list, both the tables that are in the workbook are displayed. However, in the Power View only the active table (Sales) fields are displayed. In the Table in the Power View, Salesperson ID is displayed. Suppose you want to display the Salesperson name instead. In the Power View Fields list, make the following changes ? Deselect the field Salesperson ID in the Sales table. Select the field Salesperson in the Salesperson table. As you do not have a Data Model in the workbook, no relationship exists between the two tables. No data is displayed in Power View. Excel displays messages directing you what to do. A CREATE button will be displayed in the Power View Fields pane. Click the CREATE button. A Create Relationship dialog box appears in the Power View Sheet itself. Create a relationship between the two tables using the Salesperson ID field. Without closing the Power View sheet, you have successfully created the following ? The Data Model with the two tables, and The relationship between the two tables. The field Salesperson appears in the Table in Power View along with the Sales data. Rearrange the fields in the FIELDS area to Region, Salesperson and ? Order Amount in that order. Drag the field Month to the area TILE BY. Switch visualization to Matrix. You can see that for each of the Regions, the Salespersons of that Region and sum of Order Amount are displayed. Subtotals are displayed for each Region. The display is month-wise as selected in the Tiles. When you select a Month in the Tiles, the data of that Month will be displayed in the Matrix. You are able to work with the Power View visualizations as the Data Model is now created. You can check it in the Power Pivot window. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click Manage in the Data Model group. The Power Pivot window appears. The data tables – Salesperson and Sales are created in the Data Model along with the defined relationship. Modifying Data Model from Power View Sheet You can also modify the Data Model in your workbook from the Power View sheet by adding data tables and creating relationships among the data tables. Consider the Excel table – SalesTarget in your workbook. Click on the Power View sheet. Click on the Matrix. Switch visualization to Table. Deselect the field – Month. Click the ALL tab in the Power View Fields pane. You can see that the table SalesTarget is included. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click Manage. The Power Pivot window appears displaying the Data Model. You can add a data table to the Data Model from Power View itself. Click on the Power View sheet. Select the field SalesTarget in the SalesTarget table in the Power View Fields list. The new field SalesTarget is added to the table, but a message saying – Relationships between tables may be needed. A CREATE button appears. Click the CREATE button. The Create Relationship dialog box appears. Create a relationship with the SalesPersonID field and click OK. Click in the Power Pivot window. The relationship you have created in the Power View sheet is reflected in the Data Model. Click the arrow in the field SalesTarget in the FIELDS area in the Power View Fields pane. Select Do Not Summarize from the dropdown list. Rearrange the fields in the Fields area. Excel Power View - Hierarchies If your Data Model has a hierarchy, you can use it in Power View. You can also create a new hierarchy from scratch in Power View. In both the cases, you can drill up and drill down the hierarchy in Power View. In this chapter, you will learn how to view the hierarchy and drill up and drill down the hierarchy in different Power View visualizations. Viewing a Hierarchy from Data Model If you have a hierarchy in Data Model, you can visualize the same in Power View. Suppose, you have the hierarchy Sport-Event defined in the Data Model as shown below. The hierarchy will be visible as a field in the Power View Fields list and you can add it as any other field to a Power View visualization. Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport-Event and Medal Count. Switch visualization to Matrix. The levels in the hierarchy are nested as per the order of fields in the hierarchy. Creating a Hierarchy in Power View You can also create a new hierarchy from scratch in Power View. Create a Table with the fields - Country, Sport, Event, Year, and Medal Count, in that order. Switch visualization to Matrix. The hierarchy is set by the order of the fields in the ROWS area. You can place the fields in any order in a hierarchy in Power View, provided it is meaningful. You can change the order by simply dragging the fields in the ROWS area. The difference between defining the hierarchy in Data Model and defining the hierarchy in Power View is the following ? If you define a hierarchy in Data Model, it is added to Power View Fields list as a field and you can include it in any visualization in Power View by just adding that field. On the other hand, if you define a hierarchy in Power View, it is restricted to the visualization in which you have placed the fields in the hierarchy order. It needs to be recreated in every visualization that is in the Power View. Drilling Up and Drilling Down the Hierarchy in Matrix Once you have a hierarchy in Power View (either from Data Model or from Power View), you can drill up and drill down in Matrix, Bar Chart, Column Chart and Pie Chart visualizations. In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill down the hierarchy in Matrix visualization. In the subsequent sections, you will understand how to do the same in the other mentioned visualizations. In Matrix, you can show just one level at a time. You can drill down for details and drill up for summary. Click on the Matrix. Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon. Click Show Levels in the Options group. Select Rows – Enable Drill Down One Level at a Time from the dropdown list. The Matrix collapses to display only Level 1 data. You can also find an arrow on right side of the Level 1 data value indicating drill down. Click on the drill down arrow to drill down. Alternatively, you can double click on the data value to drill down. That particular data value drills down by one Level. For the data value, you have one arrow on the left indicating drill up and one arrow on the right indicating drill down. You can double click on one data value in a Level to expand to show the data values under that in the next Level in the hierarchy. You can click on the drill up arrow to collapse to the data value. Hierarchy in Bar Chart In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill the hierarchy in a Stacked Bar Chart visualization. Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport-Event and Medal Count. Sport-Event is a hierarchy with fields Sport and Event that is defined in the Data Model. Switch visualization to Stacked Bar Chart. Ensure Country, Sport, Event are in the AXIS area. Add the field Medal to LEGEND area. A Stacked Bar Chart will be displayed. The data displayed is Medal Count by Country and Medal. Double-click a Bar, say CAN. The Stacked Bar Chart will be drilled down by one level. The data displayed is Medal Count by Sport and Medal (This is for the Country – CAN). A small up arrow, indicating drill up appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in. Now, you can either drill up to Country Level or drill down to Event Level. Double click on the Bar – Figure Skating. The Stacked Bar Chart will be drilled down by one level. The data displayed is Medal Count by Event and Medal (This is for the Country – CAN and Sport – Figure Skating). A small up arrow, indicating drill up appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in. Now, you can drill up to Sport Level (You can drill up one level at a time). Click he drill up arrow. The data displayed will be Medal Count by Sport and Medal (for Country – CAN). Click the drill up arrow. The Stacked Bar Chart will be drilled up to Country Level. Hierarchy in Column Chart In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill the hierarchy in a Stacked Column Chart visualization. Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport-Event and Medal Count. Sport-Event is a hierarchy with fields Sport and Event that is defined in the Data Model. Switch visualization to Stacked Column Chart. Ensure Country, Sport, Event are in the AXIS area. Add the field Medal to LEGEND area. A Stacked Column Chart will be displayed. The data displayed is Medal Count by Country and Medal. Double-click on a Column, say CHN. A Stacked Column Chart will be drilled down by one level. The data displayed is Medal Count by Sport and Medal (This is for the Country – CHN). A small up arrow, indicating drill up appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in. Now, you can either drill up to Country Level or drill down to Event Level. Double click on the Column – Fencing. The Stacked Column Chart will be drilled down by one level. The data displayed is Medal Count by Event and Medal (This is for the Country – CHN and Sport – Fencing). A small up arrow, indicating drill up appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in. Now, you can drill up to Sport Level (You can drill up one level at a time). Click on the drill up arrow. The data displayed will be Medal Count by Sport and Medal (for Country – CHN). Click on the drill up arrow. The Stacked Column Chart will be drilled up to Country Level. Hierarchy in Pie Chart In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill down the hierarchy in a Pie Chart visualization. Create a Table with the fields – Sport-Event and Medal Count. The Sport-Event is a hierarchy with fields Sport and Event that is defined in the Data Model. Switch visualization to Pie Chart. Ensure Sport, Event are in the COLOR area and Medal Count is in the SIZE area. A Pie Chart will be displayed. However, as the number of Sports is many, it will not be possible to display all the Sports in the Pie Chart. Filter the VIEW so that only the Sports – Gymnastics Rhythmic, Modern Pentathlon and Ski Jumping are displayed. You need to filter the VIEW and not the Pie Chart because when you drill up or drill down, the filtering needs to be in place. The data displayed is Medal Count by Sport and the Legend shows the Sport values. Double-click on a Pie Slice, say Ski Jumping. The Pie Chart will be drilled down by one level. You will observe the following ? The data displayed is Medal Count by Event (This is for the Sport – Ski Jumping). Legend shows Events (for the Sport – Ski Jumping). Pie Slices represent Events. A small up arrow, indicating drill up appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in. Now, you can drill up to Sport Level. Click the drill up arrow. The Pie Chart will be drilled up to Sport Level. Filtering Hierarchy in Pie Chart with Column Chart You can combine a Pie Chat and a Column Chart in Power View to visualize the hierarchy, drill up and drill down. Click on the Pie Chart. Add Gender to SLICES area. Click outside the Pie Chart. Create a Table with the fields - Country and Event. Click on the field Event in the FIELDS area. Click on Count (Distinct) in the dropdown menu. Filter the VIEW with the field Country to display only 5 Countries. Switch visualization to Stacked Column Chart. Click a Column in the Column Chart, say BLR. Click another Column, say JPN. Double click on the highlighted Pie Slice. You have seen the following in the above given visualizations ? How you can filter the data by Column Chart. How you can show a hierarchy Pie Chart with the filtered data. How the Pie Chart appears after drill down, where the filter is still in place. Key Performance Indicators A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a quantifiable measurement for gauging business objectives. Examples of KPIs are ? Sales department of an organization use a KPI to measure monthly gross profit against projected gross profit. Accounting department measure monthly expenditures against revenue to evaluate costs. Human resources department measure quarterly employee turnover. Business professionals frequently use KPIs that are grouped together in a business scorecard to obtain a quick and accurate historical summary of business success or to identify trends. KPIs are a form of communication involving the following activities ? Identifying the KPIs based on the organization’s objectives. Monitoring and reporting the KPIs. Altering the KPIs as the organization progresses and / or the organization’s goals change. The second and third objectives given above can be achieved with Power View. A KPI includes Base Value, Target Value/ Goal and Status. Base Value A Base Value is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value. The calculated field represents the current value for the item in that row of the Table or Matrix. For example, aggregate of sales, profit for a given period, etc. Target Value A Target Value (or Goal) is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value, or by an absolute value. The current value is evaluated against this value. This could be one of the following A fixed number that is the goal all the rows should achieve. E.g. Sales target for all the salespersons. A calculated field that might have a different goal for each row. For example, Budget (calculated field), department-wise in an organization. Status Status is the visual indicator of the value. In Power View, you can edit the KPI, choosing which indicators to use and what values to trigger each indicator. Identifying the KPIs The first and the most crucial step in KPI analysis is to identify the KPIs that effectively monitor the required trends in the organization. This requires complete understanding of the objectives and requires proper communication channels between the analysts and those who are responsible for fulfilling the objectives. There are a number of KPIs to choose from, but the success in monitoring relies on the right choice of those that are relevant to the objectives. The KPIs differ from organization to organization and from department to department. It is effective only when they lead to improvement in the performance. You can evaluate the relevance of a KPI using the SMART criteria, i.e. the KPI should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. In other words, the KPI chosen should meet the following criteria ? The KPI reflects your Specific objective. The KPI enables you to Measure progress towards that goal. The goal for which the KPI is being defined is realistically Attainable. The goal that the KPI is targeting is Relevant to the organization. You can set a Time-frame for achieving the goal so that the KPI reveals how near the goal is as compared to the time that is left. The defined KPIs are to be evaluated from time to time to find their relevance as the time progresses. If required, different KPIs need to be defined and monitored. The KPIs might have to be edited as the time progresses. Only then, your KPI monitoring will be relating to the current organization needs. Defining KPIs in the Data Model Once you identify the KPIs, you can define them in the Data Model and add them to your Power View report to show the status of the set goals. You can do any of the following ? Define the KPIs in the Data Model and use them as fields in Power View to visualize them. Define and / or edit the KPIs in Power View. You will learn how to define KPIs in the Data Model in this section. The other method you will learn in the next section. Suppose you want to monitor the sales targets of the salespersons in an organization who are selling a product. The objective is to identify the best performers who are meeting the Sales Target. You can proceed to define the KPI as follows ? Base Value ? Current Value of the Sales Amount for each salesperson. Target Value / Goal ? Target Value is fixed for all the salespersons so as to enable comparison between the salespersons. Assume that the Sales Target is 3500. Status ? The Status is to be displayed with a graphic to easily determine the status of the Base Value compared to the Target Value. Define the KPI in the Data Model as follows ? Consider the two data tables - SalesPerson and Sales. Create a relationship between the two data tables using the field SalesPerson ID. To set the Base Value, you need a calculated field for Sales Amount. Click the Data View in the Power Pivot window. Click in the cell at the bottom of the column Sales Amount Type the following DAX formula in the formula bar. Total Sales:=SUM([Sales Amount]) Click in the Excel window. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click KPIs in the Calculations group. Select New KPI from the dropdown list. The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dialog box appears. Select Total Sales in the KPI base field (value) box. Under KPI Status, do the following ? Under Define target value, select Absolute value and type 3500 in the box. Under Define status thresholds, adjust the vertical bars representing the percentages to 40 and 80. Under Select icon style, select the first option. Click OK. To check the KPI in the Data Model, do the following ? Click in the Power Pivot window. Select the diagram view. The Total Sales appears as a KPI field in the Sales data table. Visualization of KPIs in Power View Create a Power View sheet to visualize the KPI that you have defined. You will observe the following in the Sales table in Power View Fields list ? Total Sales field is a KPI and is depicted by the icon . The three KPI parameters – Value, Goal and Status appear as fields under Total Sales KPI. Select the three fields – Value, Goal and Status under the KPI Total Sales from the Sales table. Select the field Salesperson from the Salesperson table. Table visualization appears by default. The three KPI parameters appear as columns in the Table, with the Status column displaying the icons as per the corresponding values. Editing KPIs in Power View You can also define the KPI thresholds by values instead of percentages. To modify the defined KPI Total Sales, proceed as follows ? Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click KPIs in the Calculations group on the Ribbon. Select Manage KPIs from the dropdown list. The Manage KPIs dialog box appears. Click KPI – Total Sales. Click the Edit button. The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dialog box appears. Under Define status thresholds, adjust the vertical bars to 1500 and 3000. Retain the rest of the earlier options and click OK. Click Close in the Manage KPIs dialog box. Power View displays a message that the Data Model is changed. Click OK. You can see that the status icons reflect the changed thresholds Defining KPIs in Power View You can define a KPI from the Power View sheet itself. Suppose you do not have the calculated field Total Sales in the Data Model. You can create that from Power View itself. Create a new Power View sheet. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click Calculated Fields in the Calculations group on the Ribbon. Select New Calculated Field from the dropdown list. The Calculated Field dialog box appears. Fill in the details for the calculated field as shown below and click OK. The calculated field Total Sales appears in the Sales table in the Power View Fields list. You can identify it as a calculated field as it appears with a calculator icon. Now, you can use this calculated field to define a KPI from Power View. Click the POWERPIVOT tab on the Ribbon. Click KPIs in the Calculations group on the Ribbon. Select New KPI from the dropdown list. The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dialog box appears. Select Total Sales in the KPI base field (value) box. Under KPI Status, have the following options ? Under Define target value, select Absolute value and type 3500 in the box. Under Define status thresholds, adjust the vertical bars representing the percentages to 40 and 80. Under Select icon style, select the first option. Click OK. Total Sales appears as a KPI depicted by the icon with the three KPI parameters – Value, Goal and Status as fields under it. Aesthetic Reports with KPIs in Power View You can create an aesthetic report of Sales Performance with KPIs in Power View as follows ? Create a Table with the fields – Salesperson, Total Sales and Total Sales Status. Click below the Table in Power View. Create a Table with the fields – Salesperson, Total Sales and Total Sales Goal. Switch visualization to 100% Stacked Bar Chart. Click next to the Table in Power View. Create a Table with the fields – Salesperson, Region, Total Sales and Total Sales Status. Switch visualization to Card. Drag the field Region to Tile By. Type the Title – Sales Performance for the Power View Report. Resize Table, 100% Stacked Bar Chart and Card for conspicuous visualization. Observe that in Power View, you could portray the results as follows ? Table with icons for KPI status. 100% Stacked Bar Chart depicting the percentage achieved with respect to the Goal. You can also notice that it gives a clear comparison of the performance of all the Salespersons. Card visualization depicting the KPI status of the Salespersons along with the Region, which they belong. You can interactively scroll through the Tiles to display results for different Regions that would give scope to assess performance regionwise also. Excel Power View - Formatting a Report Once your data visualization and data exploration is complete, you will be ready to produce reports for presentation. Power View provides a wide range of Themes, Chart Palettes, Fonts, Background Colors, etc. that can help you make your reports appealing. In this chapter, you will learn about the various formatting features of Power View. You know that it is possible to have a combination of Power View visualizations on a single Power View report. Some of the formatting options enable you to apply the same feature for the entire view and some options can be set separately for each of the visualizations. Further, some options will get replicated to all the Power View sheets in your workbook, while some would not. The formatting features in Power View enable you to do the following ? Change the theme. Add background image. Choose background formatting. Change the text size. Change the font. Format numbers in Table, Matrix or Card. Changing Theme Consider the following Power View report ? Change the Theme as follows ? Click the POWERVIEW tab on the Ribbon. Click Themes in the Themes group. Select Composite from the dropdown gallery. The Theme of the Power View report changes to the selected one. A theme has a unique set of colors and fonts for creating a look and feel for the entire report. You can choose the theme that best suits your data, context, the background of the presentation, etc. Click in another Power View sheet in your workbook. You can observe that the new theme is applied to all the Power View sheets in the workbook. Setting Background Image You can add a background image in your Power View report, adjust its position, size and transparency. Consider the following Power View report that is filtered to show the results only for the year 2000. In 2000, Olympics were held in Sydney. You can add the respective emblem to your Power View report as follows ? Click the POWERVIEW tab on the Ribbon. Click Set Image in the Background Image group. Select Set Image from the dropdown list. Browse for the image file and open it. The image appears as a background image in the Power View report. You can resize the background image in several ways ? Stretch to occupy the entire Power View canvas. However, the aspect ratio might be lost and is not allowed for certain images. Tile to cover the entire Power View Canvas with multiple copies of the image. Center align the image. Fit to display with the right aspect ratio and cover the Power View canvas. This is also the by default, Fit option. The Center alignment option looks as shown below. You can specify the transparency of the background image. By default, it is 50%. The higher the percentage, the more transparent (less visible) the image. Click the POWERVIEW tab. Click Transparency in the Background Image group. Select 80% from the dropdown list. Change the Image Position to Tile. You can observe that the background image is set only for this Power View sheet and is not replicated in other Power View sheets in your workbook. You can remove the background image that you have set. Click the POWERVIEW tab on the Ribbon. Click Set Image in the Background Image group. Select Remove Image from the dropdown list. The background image will be removed. Changing Background Colors You can change the background colors in the Power View report. Click the POWERVIEW tab on the Ribbon. Click Background in the Themes group. You will find different backgrounds in the gallery, from solids to a variety of gradients. By default, it is white. Click Light2 Center Gradient. The background color changes to the selected one. The selected background color will be applied to all the Power View sheets in your workbook. Changing Font in a Power View Report You can change the Font in the Power View report. Click the Power View tab on the Ribbon. Click Font in the Themes group. Select Verdana from the dropdown list. The font is changed in all the visualizations. You can have only one font for all the visualizations in your Power View report. Note ? The font has not changed in the other Power View sheets in your workbook. Changing Text Size in a Power View Report You can change the size of text to a percentage of the original text size in your Power View report. Click the Power View tab on the Ribbon. Click Text Size in the Themes group. By default, it is 100%. Select 125%. The font size of the text in the entire Power View report will be enlarged. Adjust the sizes of the visualizations and the title so that they will be conspicuous. You can see that the text in the visualizations have become more readable. Note ? The text size would be the same in all the visualizations in the report and all the other Power View sheets in your workbook as well. Formatting Numbers in a Power View Report You can format numbers in Table, Matrix and Card visualizations. Create a Table with the fields – Country, Medal and Medal Count. Switch to Matrix visualization. Click on a value in the Medal Count column in the Matrix. Click the DESIGN tab on the Ribbon. Select Number from the dropdown list in the Number group. The entire column will be formatted to number. Click Decrease Indent in the Number group twice. The data will be displayed in Number format. You can format numbers in Table and Card visualizations also. Changing Number Aggregates In the Power View Fields list, some number fields will have a Sigma ? symbol next to them. They are aggregates, meaning that you can combine the values in that field to yield a numeric value such as sum, count, or average. You can aggregate a numeric or text (non-numeric) field. However, you cannot aggregate a calculated field. Create a Table with the fields Country and Medal Position. Suppose you want to switch visualization to Stacked Bar Chart. But, as you can observe, the Chart visualizations are grayed out and disabled. You can also observe that the field Medal Position has ? symbol next to it, meaning that it can be aggregated. Click the drop-down arrow next to field Medal Position in the FIELDS area. Select Count (Distinct) from the dropdown list. The field Medal Position displays a # symbol meaning it is count. In the Table, the column header changes to Count of Medal Position and the rows for each Country are displayed only once showing the count values. On the Ribbon, Chart options will be enabled. Now, you can switch visualization to Stacked Bar Chart. In a similar way, you can aggregate a text field also. This feature comes handy if you do not have numeric fields in your data. Excel Power View - Sharing Power View visualizations are interactive in nature with appealing look and feel. For any type of data and for large data sets you have suitable visualizations that will enable you to explore the data with presentable reports. So, you do not have an added step of preparing and /or previewing reports. Even formatting is interactive in nature and need not necessarily be the final step. Once you have explored and summarized your results, you would have to share with the concerned people. In this chapter, you will learn the different ways that you can share Power View reports. Sharing Power View in Excel You can share your Excel workbooks with Power View sheets on a SharePoint Server 2013 or SharePoint Online site. Your report readers can view and interact with the Power View sheets in the workbooks you have saved there. Sharing Power View in SharePoint Reports You can create and share Power View reports in SharePoint (RDLX files). The readers can view them, interact and /or edit if permissions are given on the server. Power View in Excel and Power View in SharePoint Server both provide an interactive data exploration, visualization and presentation experience for all skill levels. You can also export an interactive version of your Power View in SharePoint report to PowerPoint. Each view in Power View becomes a separate PowerPoint slide. You can interact with the visualizations and filters in each view, but you can’t create visualizations or filters. Printing Power View Reports You can print a Power View sheet. However, it will be a static image on paper. It will not be an interactive report, which is innate strength of Power View. You design a Power View report, on screen, with the look and feel you have in mind, which cannot be reflected on paper. Your visualizations are meant to be dynamic and cannot be captured by static images on paper to the fullest extent. Publishing to Power BI You can also publish Excel workbooks with Power View sheets to Power BI. Power BI saves the Power View sheets in your workbook as a Power BI report.
