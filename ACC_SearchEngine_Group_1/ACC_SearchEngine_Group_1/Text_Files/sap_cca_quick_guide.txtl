Examples include Marketing and Customer Service. A company can classify business unit as profit center, cost center or an investment center. The simple and straightforward division in an organization can be classified as cost center as cost is easy to measure. To create a cost center in system, you need to define a cost center hierarchical structure. The structure of a Cost center and its characteristics depend on the accounting objective and on the system, you want to use to maintain accounting. Use of a Cost Center Following are the key uses to create cost centers and performing cost center accounting in an organization ? Cost center is used to align overhead costs with activities performed in an organization. It is possible to assign different activity type to a cost center. You perform cost center accounting to manage cost in the organization and to check profitability of each functional area and decision-making data. You can manage and analyze the overhead cost in an organization and verify if they are incurred in the organization activities. When you plan costs at cost center, this allows you to check the cost efficiency at the point when costs are incurred in the organization. You can directly assign the cost-to-cost centers for products, services, and market segments, which are involved in performing these activities. You have to implement Cost Center Accounting with Financial Accounting, which includes General Ledger (G/L), Accounts Payable (AP) and Account Receivable (AR). To implement Cost Center Accounting with Finance Accounting, you need to create company code, Chart of Accounts COA’s in Financial Accounting. Key Features of Cost Center The key features of Cost Center are ? Actual Cost Accounting ? You can transfer actual cost from other components like Material Management MM, Asset Accounting AA, etc. and you can also record other actual cost in the system. Actual Cost Allocation ? There are different methods that you can use to record actual cost. Actual cost can be distinguished as per transaction-based allocation and period based allocation. Plan cost allocation ? You can also plan the actual cost allocations for the cost centers. Activity Accounting ? This is used to calculate the operating cost. For a cost center and activity, output defines the target cost of cost center. Hierarchy of Cost Center In the following illustration, you can see cost center hierarchy. At the top, you have organization, which is further divided as per the functional areas. Each Functional area is further divided into sub-areas and can be further divided as per the activities performed. SAP CCA - Activity Types Activity type is defined as activity performed in Cost Center within controlling area. For each cost center, you perform the following activities ? Activities performed by the Cost Center Costs are debited to products when they use the activities of the Cost Center. In Cost Center Accounting, to plan and allocate the activities, the system records quantities that are measured in activity units. Each activity in a Cost Center contains activity types and the costs can be allocated to these activity types. When you create the activity types, prices of these can be entered manually or this can be calculated in the system as per the costs allocated. The cost planning, allocation and control can be performed while defining activity or can also be performed at Cost Center. Setting up Activity Types To create an activity type, follow the given steps ? Step 1 ? Use the T-Code: KL01 Step 2 ? In the next window, you have to select Controlling Area. Enter the name Activity Type Validity Date Click Master data Step 3 ? Go to Master data and you can see different tabs in next window. Go to basic tab and enter the following details. Activity Name Description Activity Unit CCtr Categories Activity type category ? You can select from the following options. Step 4 ? Enter the details in other fields as shown below. Step 5 ? Go to the Output tab to define the output unit. Step 6 ? Once you define all the fields, click the save button at the top. Assign rates for an activity Step 1 ? If you want to assign the Rates for an activity type & Cost Center in the combination, you can use T-Code: KP26 Step 2 ? In next screen, you have to enter the following details. Enter version as 0 from period 1 and to period as 12 Fiscal Year Enter the cost center, Activity type Step 3 ? Next go to the Overview screen at the top to assign hourly rate. Enter per hour Rate under Fixed price and set value as 2 for distribution key and plan price indicator as 3. You can use this combination of activity type and Cost Center while creating work centers to be assigned. SAP CCA - Master Data In SAP system, you use Cost Center to determine the structure of your organization. Master data in Cost Center remains same for longer time periods. In order to find out errors in Cost Center, you need to execute Cost Center planning that generates area reports. It is necessary to keep master data same to perform these analysis. You can maintain master data in SAP system manually or move from the external system. To load the master data, you can use following processes ? External data from Functional modules External data from BAPI’s In SAP system, you generally have two types of data ? Transaction data Transaction data keeps on changing in system and is stored in line item tables. Master data You can use the following functions to create or change the master data ? Cost Center Cost Elements Activity Types Key Figures Resources For each of the above objects, you can perform multiple functions in SAP system. The following functions are available ? Master Data Elements Functions Cost Center Create, Change, Display, Delete and Display Changes Cost Elements Create, Change, Display, Delete and Display Changes Activity Types Create, Change, Display, Delete and Display Changes Key Figures Create, Change, Delete and Display Business Processes Create, Change, Delete and Display Cost Center Cost center in accounting is used to differentiate between different activities and for differentiated controlling of costs arising in an organization. Each cost center is assigned with different activity types and each activity type shows the specific activities in cost center. Cost centers can be further combined into Cost Center groups and they can be used to create Cost Center hierarchies by combining responsibility area and other factors. To create a Cost Center, you have to first define Cost Center hierarchical structure. Cost Elements Cost Element is known as cost relevant item in Chart of Accounts. In SAP Cost Center Accounting, you have the following Cost elements ? Primary Cost Elements A Primary cost element is defined as elements for which General Ledger Account G/L exists in Finance Accounting FI. Common primary cost element includes ? Personnel Costs Material Costs Secondary Cost Elements These elements are maintained in Cost Accounting. To create a secondary cost element, the system first checks already existing accounts in Financial Accounting and if an account exists, then secondary cost element cannot be created. Cost element for Order settlement is a common example of secondary cost element. Cost Element Category Types Cost element category is used to define if you can post to cost element directly or not. When you post a fixed amount to a cost element by mentioning account number, it is called direct posting. In direct posting, you can post directly to all primary cost elements by specifying the account number. When you cannot enter account number with posting transaction and the system determines the account at the time of posting it automatically, is known as indirect posting. Maintaining Cost Element Master data In SAP system, cost element master data is maintained using time based dependencies. There are different time-based dependencies in a SAP system ? Time-independent fields(I) Fisco-year based fields(Y) Period-based fields(P) Day-based fields(D) Description Cost element charactersistics None Default account assignment Name Cost element category Record quality indicator Unit of measure Statistical Key Figures Statistical key figures can be defined manually or you can transfer it automatically from the information system of SAP system application. Key figures can be defined as ? Fixed values ? All the key figures that you define as fixed values are available for positing in full fiscal year. Total values ? Key figures defined as total values are available only for posting in the defined period. Resources Resources are used to perform quantity-based cost planning for cost centers, orders and WBS element. In SAP system as per the available data, you can select from the following resource types ? Type R for overhead cost controlling Type M represents for Material type Type B refers to base planning objects The structure of resource master data contains the following fields ? Resource key Purchasing organization Resource type Validity period of the resource Plant Resource units Cost element Resource name Material Base object costing SAP CCA - Cost Center Groups You can divide cost center in cost center groups. In system, it should have at least one group that contains all cost centers and represents the entire business organization. This cost center group is described as the standard hierarchy. You can assign more cost center groups to the standard hierarchy. Note ? In standard hierarchy, you can only assign each cost center to one group. Create Cost Center Group To create a cost center group ? Step 1 ? Navigate to Accounting ? Controlling ? Cost Center Accounting ? Master Data ? Cost Element Groups ? Create/Change/Display While creating a new group, it is possible to use an existing group as a template. The template group can belong to the same Controlling Area or COA. Enter the name of new group. The highest node contains the group names entered. The existing structure is appended to the highest node. This means that every change to the original automatically affects the copy. You can create your groups successively in the group structure display. Step 2 ? Choose the node that you want to extend the group, and select from Insert at same level or Insert at lower level. You can create your groups successively in the group structure display. Step 3 ? Choose the node from which you want to extend the group. Click insert at same level or Insert at lower level. Step 4 ? Enter the name and description for the new subgroup.

Features of an Internal Order You can create an internal order to monitor the costs of a time-restricted job or the costs for the production of activities. Internal orders can also be used for the long-term monitoring of costs. Investment cost related to fixed assets are monitored using Investment orders. Period-related accrual calculation between expenses in FI and the costing-based costs debited in Cost Accounting are monitored using Accrual orders. Costs and revenues incurred for activities for external partners or for internal activities that do not form part of the core business for your organization are monitored using order with revenues. SAP CCA - Planning In SAP system, Cost Center Planning is used to maintain figures for cost, prices and key figures for cost center in defined period of planning. It is a part of business planning process and is required for standard costing. You perform Cost Center planning to achieve following functions ? To Plan the structure To control and monitor business growth To perform target comparison-plan/actual or target/actual Cost center planning covers following planning area Cost Element Primary Cost Secondary Cost Revenue Activity Type Statistical Key Figures To see details about Cost Center planning in SAP system ?

To perform period end closing, it is required to transfer the data from other SAP Components. You should perform all the posting in Finance Accounting. Example All invoices should be created and posted in Finance Accounting as a part of Sales and Distribution. You use reconciliation posting to perform reconciliation between Finance Accounting and Controlling by doing relevant allocations in FI. As part of period-closing, following activities are performed ? Periodic reposting Accrual cost calculation Pre-distribution of fixed costs Transfer of statistical key figures from the LIS Overhead calculation Periodic allocations Variance calculation Actual price calculation SAP CCA - Accrual Calculation You allocate operating expenses differently in cost accounting as compared to Finance accounting. You can distribute irregular occurring expenses as per cost origin, on the months in which they are incurred. Hence, you can avoid all irregularities within cost accounting. Cost allocated in this way is known as Accrual cost. Accrual calculation can be performed in the following way ? Accruals in the Controlling component based on the costs posted. Accruals in the Financial Accounting component (FI) using recurring entries. In order to perform the accrual calculation in plan or actual from the Cost Center Accounting menu ? Step 1 ?

SAP CCA - Schedule Manager You can perform different periodic in SAP system on regular basis- weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. One of the common task is period-end closing. These tasks involve the processing of a large number of individual objects and they are supported by the individual components of the Schedule Manager. To perform these tasks, you define the variables in Schedule Manager and this reduces the work that is required to perform these tasks. You can define the following variables in Schedule Manager ? Defining Global Variables for the Task List and Flow Definition Defining Selection Variables Specifying Selection Variables in the Program Variants Specifying Selection Variables for Flow Definitions With Parallel Branches Scheduler in Scheduler Manager You can use the Scheduler to execute and monitor complex business processes, such as period-end closing. If you have the corresponding authorization, you can define task lists. In the structure tree, you can create the business transactions (Task) that, for example, make up period-end closing. You can schedule these tasks in the daily overview, and if required, the system executes them. Creating a Task List in Scheduler In SAP Schedule Manager, you can use task list as the basis of the scheduler. In Task list, you can arrange tasks or task groups into a chronological structure. Step 1 ? To open Scheduler Manager, navigate to Accounting ? Controlling ? Cost Center Accounting ? Period End Closing ? Scheduler Manager. Step 2 ? Go to Task list ? Create Step 3 ?

SAP CCA - Variance Calculation When actual cost on cost center is different from target cost or planning was over/under, you can see a variance in controlling component. Using Variance calculation, you can analyze the actual balance and to find variance of actual cost from target cost with different activity types. To perform variance calculation, follow the given steps. Step 1 ? Navigate to Accounting ? Controlling ? Product Cost Controlling ? Cost Object Controlling ? Product Cost by Period or Product Cost by Order ? Period-End Closing ? Single Functions: Product Cost Collector ? Single Functions: Cost Object Hierarchy ? Variances ? Individual Processing or Collective Processing. Step 2 ? If you want to calculate the variances for a single cost object hierarchy, you have to select the option - Individual Processing and to calculate the variances for all cost object hierarchies in a controlling area, you have to select Collective Processing. Step 3 ? Next, define whether you want to calculate the variances for all target cost versions or only for a particular target cost version. Step 4 ? You can select the option- Selected target cost versions and specify the target cost version under ? Extras ? Set versions. Step 5 ? Set the indicators for processing options. Click the Execute button at the top. The system calculates the variances. When you select Detail list under Processing options, the system displays Variance Calculation List. SAP CCA - Year-End Closing In year-end closing, you can transfer carry forward to first period of next fiscal year and this is performed for each Controlling under SAP system. Step 1 ? To carry forward a commitment, navigate to Accounting ? Controlling ? Cost Center Accounting ? Year end Closing ? Commitment Carry Forward. Step 2 ? In the next window, you have to enter cost center. Under processing option, you can choose from the following indicators ? Test run ? Test run allows the system to carry forward the commitment, but does not update the results. Detail lists ? When you select detail list, the system displays the results of the commitment carried forward. When you select the Detail list and Test run, this allows you to check the results of the test run. You can use Reversal indicator to ensure that data that has been already carry forward will not be reversed again or not. When you have large amount of data to process, you should use the background processing. This means you can process data at times of minimal system usage. Step 3 ? To perform background processing, go to Program ? Execute in Background. When you click the execute button while selecting detail and test run option, result will be displayed as shown below ? SAP CCA - Product Costing SAP CCA – Product Costing module is used to find the value of internal cost of products. It is also used for profitability and management accounting for production. While configuring Product Costing, it involves two areas for setting ? Product Cost Planning Cost Object Controlling The basics of Product Costing is Cost Center Planning. The goal of cost center planning is to plan total dollars and quantities in each Cost Center in a plant. Step 1 ? T-code: KP06 and enter the controlling area. Cost Center dollars are planned by Activity-Type and cost element. You can also enter the variable and fixed dollar amounts. Step 2 ? You can plan all costs in production cost centers where they will end up through allocations, or you can plan costs where they are incurred and use plan assessments and distributions to allocate. Step 2 ? To define cost center activity quantities, use T-code: KP26. You can also manually enter an activity rate based on last year's actual values. Note that if you enter an activity rate instead of using the system to calculate a rate, you lose the opportunity to review actual vs. plan and see dollar and unit variances. It is a best practice to plan activity quantities based on practical installed capacity, which accounts for downtime. If you plan at full capacity, plan activity rates will be underestimated. Example Let us say we are using Product Costing to value our inventory in a cookie baking shop. This will help us value our cookies (finished good), frosting (semi-finished good), and baking items like eggs, milk, and sugar (raw materials). In order to calculate costs, we need to come up with rates for each activity, such as mixing baking items, oven baking, and cookie cooling. Since a rate is a dollar per unit, we can either come up with a rate based on previous year's actual rates, or enter our total costs and total units. SAP CCA - Profitability Analysis SAP COPA is used to analyze the market segments classified as products, customers, sales area, business area, etc. SAP CO Profitability Analysis (CO-PA) is used for the evaluation of Market segments, which is classified according to products, customers, and orders. or any combination of these or Strategic business units such as sales organizations or business areas, with reference to company's profit or contribution margin. The following two types of Profitability Analysis are supported ? Costing-based Profitability Analysis ? It is used to group the costs and revenues as per the value fields. It is used to ensure that you access at all times to a complete, short-term profitability report. Account-based Profitability Analysis ? It is used to provide you with a profitability report that is permanently reconciled with financial accounting. It is mainly used for getting information related to sales, marketing, product management, and corporate planning departments to support internal accounting and decision-making. Key Components in SAP CO-PA The key components in SAP CO-PA are as follows ? Actual Posting It allows you to transfer sales orders and billing documents from the Sales and Distribution application component to CO-PA in real time. You can also transfer costs from cost centers, orders and projects, as well as costs and revenues from direct postings or settle costs from CO to profitability segment. Information System It allows you to analyze existing data from a profitability standpoint using drilldown function in the reporting tool. It allows you to navigate through a multidimensional data cube using different functions like drilldown or switching hierarchies. The system displays data in either value fields or accounts, depending on the currently active type of Profitability Analysis and the type to which the report structure is assigned. Planning This allows you to create a sales and profit plan. Whereas both types of Profitability Analysis can receive actual data in parallel, there is no common source of planning data.
