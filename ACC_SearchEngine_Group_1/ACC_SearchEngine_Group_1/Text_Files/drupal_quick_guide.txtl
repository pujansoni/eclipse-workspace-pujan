Click Configuration from the menu bar. Step 2 ? In Development section click Performance. Step 3 ? Enable Cache blocks and Cache pages for Anonymous Users by checking both the boxes. Then, click Save Configuration. Compress CSS files If you have many CSS files, it can lower your websites speed. Compress them by enabling Aggregate and Compress CSS files. Enable this setting from Administration?Configuration?Development?Performance section.Drupal decreases the number and size of your CSS files. Js Aggregation Java files can also affect the performance and speed of your website. To compress this enable the Aggregate JavaScript files from the Administration?Configuration?Development?Performance in the bandwidth optimization section. Moving Media Files and Static files to a CDN This decreases the number of requests that a shared hosting handles. Use CDN (Content Delivery Network) that hosts your media files and static files. CDN acts as an external cache for your files and will store them in high performance servers so that it is optimized. Optimize Images Size and Their Number Do not have many images which consume more space as this leads to slow website. Always resize your images and have few that are related to your website. Theme Optimization Optimizing themes is a very important aspect. Media files like high quality images, videos, audios and flash can affect your website and slow down the speed resulting in low performance. Try reducing the size and number of media files or maybe you can avoid using flash. Drupal - Site Backup In this chapter, we will study about Site Backup in Drupal.

Database log messages to keep ? It indicates the maximum number of messages to be kept in the database log. Drupal uses _drupal_exception_handler ($exception) function to handle the errors on the site. These errors will not be enclosed in a try/catch block. The script won't execute the function when an exception handler exits. The code for _drupal_exception_handler is as follows ? 
function _drupal_exception_handler($exception) {
   require_once DRUPAL_ROOT . '/includes/errors.inc';

   try {
      // display the error message in the log and return the error messages to the user
      _drupal_log_error(_drupal_decode_exception($exception), TRUE);
   }catch (Exception $excp2) {
      // Another uncaught exception was thrown while handling the first one.
      // If we are displaying errors, then do so with no possibility of a further
         //uncaught exception being thrown.
      if (error_displayable()) {
         print '<h1>Additional uncaught exception thrown while handling exception.</h1>';
         print '<h2>Original</h2><p>' . _drupal_render_exception_safe($exception) . '</p>';
         print '<h2>Additional</h2><p>' . _drupal_render_exception_safe($excp2) . '</p><hr />';
      }
   }
}
 The function must be used on every Drupal request. This function is present at the line 2328 in the file includes/bootstrap.inc.

You can report a security issue directly with Drupal core, contrib or Drupal.org by sending an e-mail regarding the issue. The security team will help in resolving your issue with the help of project maintainer. Secure your file permissions and ownership by configuring the server file system, as the web server (e.g. Apache) should not have access to edit or write the files. It should be read only files, which gets executed later. The security risk levels are based on NIST Common Misuse Scoring System (NISTIR 7864), so that the organization can verify how to manage the problem. Below are the points that will help you understand the security risk level by assigning the number between 0 to 25 ? 0 to 4 ? Not Critical. 5 to 9 ? Less Critical. 10 to 14 ? Moderately Critical. 15 to 19 ? Critical. 20 to 25 ? Highly Critical. While accepting the sensitive information like credit card number, the PCI (Payment Card Industry) defines a number of Data Security Standards.
