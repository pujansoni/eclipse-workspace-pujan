It is unique in many ways as compared to the traditional BI platforms. As a data analysis tool, it always maintains the relationship between the data and this relationship can be seen visually using colors. It also shows the data that are not related. It provides both direct and indirect searches by using individual searches in the list boxes. QlikView's core and patented technology has the feature of in-memory data processing, which gives superfast result to the users. It calculates aggregations on the fly and compresses data to 10% of original size. Neither users nor developers of QlikView applications manage the relationship between data. It is managed automatically. Features of QlikView QlikView has patented technology, which enables it to have many features that are useful in creating advanced reports from multiple data sources quickly. Following is a list of features that makes QlikView very unique. Data Association is maintained automatically ? QlikView automatically recognizes the relationship between each piece of data that is present in a dataset. Users need not preconfigure the relationship between different data entities. Data is held in memory for multiple users, for a super-fast user experience ? The structure, data and calculations of a report are all held in the memory (RAM) of the server. Aggregations are calculated on the fly as needed ? As the data is held in memory, calculations are done on the fly. No need of storing pre-calculated aggregate values. Data is compressed to 10% of its original size ? QlikView heavily uses data dictionary. Only essential bits of data in memory is required for any analysis. Hence, it compresses the original data to a very small size. Visual relationship using colors ? The relationship between data is not shown by arrow or lines but by colors. Selecting a piece of data gives specific colors to the related data and another color to unrelated data. Direct and Indirect searches ? Instead of giving the direct value a user is looking for, they can input some related data and get the exact result because of the data association. Of course, they can also search for a value directly. QlikView - Installation Download QlikView The Free Personal Edition of QlikView can be downloaded from QlikView Personal Edition.

QlikView - Architecture As a leading Business Discovery Platform, QlikView is built with a very different approach to data discovery than other traditional platforms. QlikView does not first build a query and then fetch the result based on the query. Rather, it forms associations between different data objects as soon as it is loaded and prompts the user to explore the data in any way. There is no predefined data drill down paths. The data drill down paths can happen in any direction as long as the data is available and associated. Of course, a user can also play a role in creating the associations between data elements using data modeling approach available in QlikView. Architectural Overview QlikView's architecture consists of a front end to visualize the processed data and a back end to provide the security and publication mechanism for QlikView user documents. The diagram given below depicts the internal working of QlikView. The architecture is discussed in detail below the picture. Front End The Front end in QlikView is a browser-based access point for viewing the QlikView documents. It contains the QlikView Server, which is mainly used by the Business users to access the already created BI reports through an internet or intranet URL. Business users explore and interact with data using this front end and derive conclusions about the data. They also collaborate with other users on a given set of reports by sharing insights and exploring data together, in real time or off-line. These user documents are in the format .qvw, which can also be stored in the windows OS as a standalone document The QlikView server in the front end manages the client server communication between the user and QlikView backend system. Back End The QlikView backend consists of QlikView desktop and QlikView publisher. The QlikView desktop is a wizard-driven Windows environment, which has the features to load and transform data from its source. Its drag and drop feature is used to create the GUI layout of the reports that becomes visible in the frontend. The file types, which are created by QlikView desktop are stored with an extension of .qvw. These are the files that are passed on to the QlikView server in the front end, which serves the users with these files. Also .qvw files can be modified to store the data-inly files, which are known as .qvd files. They are binary files, which contain only the data and not the GUI components. The QlikView publisher is used as distribution service to distribute the .qvw documents among various QlikView servers and users. It handles the authorization and access privileges. It also does the direct loading of data from data sources by using the connection strings defined in the .qvw files. QlikView - Navigation In this chapter, we will get acquainted with the screens available to a user for doing various operations. We will learn the basic navigation and know the different functions performed by the icons available in QlikView.

Remove ? completely removes the sheet along with the sheet objects. The Window and Help menus are used to organize the different windows of QlikView application and provide help documentation. QlikView - Excel Files QlikView accepts Excel spreadsheet for data analysis by simple drag and drop action. You need to open the QlikView main window and drag and drop the excel file into the interface. It will automatically create the sheet showing the excel data. Select the Excel file Keep the main window of QlikView open and browse for the excel file you want to use. Select a Data Source On dropping the excel file into the main window, the File wizard appears. The File Type is already chosen as Excel. Under Labels, choose Embedded Labels. Click "Next step" to proceed. Load Script The Load script appears which shows the command that loads the data into the QlikView document. This command can be edited. Now, the Excel wizard prompts to save the file in the form of *.qvw file extension. It asks to select a location where you need to save the file. Click "Next step" to proceed. Now it is time to see the data that is loaded from the Excel file. We use a Table Box sheet object to display this data. Create Table Box The Table Box is a sheet object to display the available data as a table. It is invoked from the menu Layout ? New Sheet Object ? Table Box. On clicking Next, we get the option to choose the fields from the Table Box. You can use the Promote or Demote buttons to rearrange the fields. Table Box Data On completing the above step, the Table Box Sheet Object appears which shows the data that is read from the Excel file. QlikView - Delimited File QlikView can use the data in plane text file where the fields are separated by characters like comma, tab, semicolon etc. Here, we will take CSV as an example. A file in which each column of data is separated by a comma is known as a CSV file. It is a very widely used file format to store plane text-data organized as columns and rows. QlikView loads csv files using the Data from files options available in the script editor under the File Menu. Alternatively, you can also open a new QlikView document and press control+E to get the script editor window as shown below. Choose the file Product_details.csv from the appropriate path. Select the File Headers On opening the selected CSV file, a window as shown below comes up. Under Labels choose Embedded Labels, as our file has a header row as its first row. Click Finish. Load Script The loading of the file into QlikView is done through the load script, which can be seen in the screen shot below. Hence, when we use any delimited file, we can tweak the below script as per the file format. Now the script wizard prompts to save the file in the form of *.qvw file extension. It asks to select a location where you need to save the file. Click "Next step" to proceed. Now, it is time to see the data that is loaded from the delimited file. We use a Table Box sheet object to display this data. Create Table Box The Table Box is a sheet object to display the available data as a table. It is invoked from the menu Layout ? New Sheet Object ? Table Box. On clicking Next, we get the option to choose the fields from the Table Box. You can use the Promote or Demote buttons to rearrange the fields. Table Box Data On completing the above step, the Table Box Sheet Object appears which shows the data that is read from the Excel file. QlikView - XML File XML is a file format, which shares both the file format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets, and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. It stands for Extensible Markup Language (XML). Similar to HTML it contains markup tags. However, unlike HTML where the markup tag describes structure of the page, in XML the markup tags describe the meaning of the data contained into the file. QlikView can use the data from XML files. The process to load the data from XML files is similar to the loading of delimited files we have seen earlier. Open the script editor. Click on the menu Insert ? Load Statement ? Load from File. Browse for the XML file you wish to load. In this example, we are choosing the employee_dat.xml file. Select the XML File Structure On opening the selected XML file, a window comes up as shown below. Under the File Type section in the left, choose XML. The content of the XML file now appears as a table along with the header column. Click Finish. File Loader Script The loading of the XML file into QlikView is done through the load script, which can be seen below. So when we use any XML file, we can tweak the below given script to rename the columns or change the file location etc. Now the script wizard prompts you to save the file in the form of *.qvw file extension. It asks to select a location where you need to save the file. Click "Next step" to proceed. Now it is time to see the data that is loaded from the XML file. We use a Table Box sheet object to display this data. Create Table Box The Table Box is a sheet object to display the available data as a table. It is invoked from the menu Layout ? New Sheet Object ? Table Box. On clicking Next, we get the option to choose the fields from the Table Box. You can use the Promote or Demote buttons to rearrange the fields. Table Box Data On completing the above step, the Table Box Sheet Object appears which shows the data that is read from the Excel file. QlikView - Web File QlikView can process files from the web, which are in the HTML format. It can extract data from HTML tables. The URL of the web file to be processed is given as an input and QlikView fetches both, the structure and content of the file. Then it analyzes the structure of the page extracting the relevant data from the HTML tables present in the page. We choose the Web files option from the Data from files section under the Data tab of script Editor. Give the URL as Input On selecting the Web files option, we get a new window to give the URL as input. In this example, we are choosing the List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia as the input page from Wikipedia. Mention the URL and click Next. Select the Table from the Web File On opening the selected Web file, the window shown below comes up. Here we can see the various tables present in the webpage labeled as @1, @1, @3 and so on. Choose the first table and click Next twice. Select the Columns of the Table From the above table, we can choose only the columns we need by removing the unwanted columns using the cross sign. Load Script The loading of the file into QlikView is done through the load script, which can be seen in the screen shot given below. Hence, when we use any delimited file, we can tweak the below given script as per the file format. Now the script wizard prompts to save the file in the form of *.qvw file extension. It asks to select a location where you need to save the file. Click "Next step" to proceed. Now it is time to see the data that is loaded from the web file. We use a Table Box sheet object to display this data. Create Table Box The Table Box is a sheet object to display the available data as a table. It is invoked from the menu Layout ? New Sheet Object ? Table Box. On clicking Next, we get the option to choose the fields from the Table Box. You can use the Promote or Demote buttons to rearrange the fields. Table Box Data On completing the above step, the Table Box Sheet Object appears, which shows the data that is read from the Web file. Mark the Non-English characters !! QlikView - Database Connection QlikView can connect to most of the popular databases like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Postgress etc. It can fetch data and table structures into QlikView environment and store the results in its memory for further analysis. The steps to connect to any of these databases involves creating an ODBC connection using a DSN and then using this DSN to fetch the data. For this tutorial, we will be connecting to MySQL database. This tutorial assumes you have a MySQL environment available. Create an ODBC DSN (Data Source Name) for MySQL, following these steps ? to create DSN. Name the DSN as mysqluserdsn or you may prefer to use the existing one if you have already created a DSN for MySql. Connecting to the Database For this chapter we will use the MySql inbuilt database named sakila. We create a new QlikView document and open the script editor (pressing Control+E). Under the tab Data, we locate the section named Database. Choose ODBC from the drop down list and click Connect. The following window opens. Choose the DSN named mysqluserdns and click Test Connection. The message Connection Test succeeded should appear. Verifying Connection to Database On successful connection, the screen given below appears showing the connection to the DB in the main window of the script editor. Select Database Table Click Select iin the above window to get the list of tables and columns. Here as we have created the DSN with sakila as the default database we get the list of tables and columns from this database. We can choose another database from the database drop down list as shown in the screenshot given below. We will continue using the sakila database for this chapter. Table Loader Script On Clicking OK in the above window, we get back to the main script editor showing the script for using the table named actor. Showing the Result in qvd File Now the data loaded into QlikView document needs to be stored permanently to be analyzed further. For this, we will edit the script to store the data in the form of a qvd file. Press Control+E to open the edit script window and write the following code. In the code, we give appropriate names to the columns and mention the table name above the load statement. In addition, we give a path where the generated qvd file will be stored. Save this file as QV_mysql.qvw Using the qvd File The qvd file can be loaded into the main document and used to create graphs and tables for further analysis. Press Control+R to reload the QV_mysql.qvw file and click Next in the chart wizard. Choose the straight table to be created with actor_id, first_name, last_name as the dimensions and count of actor_id as the expression. A chart appears as given below. QlikView - Inline Data Data can be entered into a QlikView document by directly typing or pasting it. This feature is a quick method to get the data from the clipboard into the QlikView. The script editor provides this feature under the Insert tab. Script Editor To open the Inline data load option, we open the script editor and go to Insert ? Load Statement ? Load Inline. Inserting Data On opening the above screen, we get a spreadsheet-like document where we can type the values. We can also paste the values already available in the clipboard. Please note the column headers are created automatically. Click Finish. Load Script The command, which loads the data, is created in the background which can be seen in the script editor. Table Box Data On creating a Table Box Sheet Object, we see the data that is read from the Inline data load option. QlikView - Resident Load QlikView can load data from tables already existing in its RAM, which is already processed by a script. This requirement arises when you want to create a table deriving data from an already existing table in the same script. Please note that both the new table and the existing table should be in the same script. Creating the Load Script Open the script editor (or use Control+E) and mention the following script. Here we create an inline table named Regions with sales data for different regions. Then we create another table named Total to calculate the total sales by Region Names. Finally we drop the table Regions, as in this .qvw file we only need the table named Total for data analysis. Table Box Data On creating a Table Box Sheet Object, we see the data that is read from the resident data load option. QlikView - Preceding Load QlikView Preceding load is a load type in which we use a load statement, which takes the columns of another load statement present in the same script. The data read by the first Load statement, which is at the bottom of the script editor window and then used by the load statements above it. Load Script The below given screen shot shows the script for data, which is loaded as Inline data and then the max function is applied to one of the columns. The load statement at the bottom makes the data available in QlikView's memory, which is used by the second load statement above the first load statement. The second load statement applies the max function with group by clause. Table Box Data On creating a Table Box Sheet Object, we see the data that is read from the Inline data load option. QlikView - Incremental Load As the volume of data in the data source of a QlikView document increases, the time taken to load the file also increases which slows down the process of analysis. One approach to minimize this time taken to load data is to load only the records that are new in the source or the updated ones. This concept of loading only the new or changed records from the source into the QlikView document is called Incremental Load. To identify the new records from source, we use either a sequential unique key or a date time stamp for each row. These values of unique key or data time field has to flow from the source file to QlikView document. Let us consider the following source file containing product details in a retail store. Save this as a .csv file in the local system where it is accessible by QlikView. Over a period of time some more products are added and the description of some product changes. 
Product_Id,Product_Line,Product_category,Product_Subcategory
1,Sporting Goods,Outdoor Recreation,Winter Sports & Activities
2,"Food, Beverages & Tobacco",Food Items,Fruits & Vegetables
3,Apparel & Accessories,Clothing,Uniforms
4,Sporting Goods,Athletics,Rugby
5,Health & Beauty,Personal Care
6,Arts & Entertainment,Hobbies & Creative Arts,Musical Instruments
7,Arts & Entertainment,Hobbies & Creative Arts,Orchestra Accessories
8,Arts & Entertainment,Hobbies & Creative Arts,Crafting Materials
9,Hardware,Tool Accessories,Power Tool Batteries
10,Home & Garden,Bathroom Accessories,Bath Caddies
11,"Food, Beverages & Tobacco",Food Items,Frozen Vegetables
12,Home & Garden,Lawn & Garden,Power Equipment
 Loading the Data into QlikView We will load the above CSV file using the script editor (Control+E) by choosing the Table Files option as shown below. Here we also save the data into a QVD file in the local system. Save the QlikView document as a .qvw file. Verifying the Data Loaded. We can check the data loaded to QlikView document by creating a sheet object called Table Box. This is available in the Layout menu and New Sheet Objects sub-menu. Creating the Table Layout On selecting the Table Box sheet object, we get to the next screen, which is used to select the columns and their positions in the table to be created. We choose the following columns and their positions and click Finish. Viewing the Existing Data The following chart showing the data as laid out in the previous step appears. Updating the Source Data Let us add the following three more records to the source data. Here, the Product IDs are the unique numbers, which represent new records. 
13,Office Supplies,Presentation Supplies,Display
14,Hardware,Tool Accessories,Jigs
15,Baby & Toddler,Diapering,Baby Wipes
 Incremental load script Now, we write the script to pull only the new records form the source. 
// Load the data from the stored qvd.
Stored_Products:
LOAD Product_Id, 
     Product_Line, 
     Product_category, 
     Product_Subcategory
FROM
[E:\Qlikview\data\products.qvd]
(qvd);

//Select the maximum value of Product ID.
Max_Product_ID:
Load max(Product_Id) as MaxId
resident Stored_Products;

//Store the Maximum value of product Id in a variable.
Let MaxId = peek('MaxId',-1);

	 drop table Stored_Products;


//Pull the rows that are new.	 
NewProducts:
LOAD Product_Id,Product_Line, Product_category,Product_Subcategory
	 from [E:\Qlikview\data\product_categories.csv]
	 (txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is ',', msq)
	 where Product_Id > $(MaxId);
	 
//Concatenate the new values with existing qvd.
Concatenate
LOAD Product_Id,Product_Line, Product_category, 
     Product_Subcategory
FROM [E:\Qlikview\data\products.qvd](qvd);

//Store the values in qvd.
store NewProducts into [E:\Qlikview\data\products.qvd](qvd);
 The above script fetches only the new records, which are loaded and stored into the qvd file. As we see the records with the new Product IDs 13, 14 and 15. QlikView - Data files (QVD) One of the important features of QlikView, which makes it so distinguished is the ability to store very large amount of data in a very compressed size and store it along with the QlikView documents. Therefore, once the document is created we need not connect to the data source, as the data is already stored along with the layout of the document. This is achieved through QVD file, which is a flat file stored with the .qvd extension. A QVD file stores data for one QlikView document and it is created using the script editor available in the QlikView document. Advantages of Using QVD Files The advantages of using QVD files in QlikView are as follows ? Faster Loading of Data Gracefully support scaling up as the data volume grows Used in incremental load Data from multiple sources can be clubbed to one data set Extract data in parallel Creating QVD Files QVD files are created using the STORE statement during the loading of QlikView files. This statement creates a single qvd file, which gets stored in the specified location as a file; separate than the QVW file through which it is created. Given below is an example of storing the qvd file after the data is loaded into the QlikView document by reading a source file. Using QVD Files A QVD file is loaded to a QlikView document in a similar way as other files like CSV, Excel and delimited files are used. We use the the Open option available under the File menu and browse for the QVD file we created before. On opening it gives us a window to see the data, select the column headers and do any data transformation required QVD File Loader Script On clicking Finish, the edit script window appears which shows the code used to load the QVD file. We can edit this code further. For example, to get only the few of the columns to be displayed or apply any inbuilt function etc. Click finish to load the file into the current QlikView document. Save the QlikView document as use_qvd.qvw. Displaying Data from QVD File Reload the document by using Control+R and choose the menu option Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box. A window appears showing all the columns from the table present in the QVD file. Select "Add All" to add all the columns to the display table. Use the "Promote/Demote" option to change the order of the columns. Click "Finish". The following screen appears showing the content of the QVD file. QlikView - Sheet and Objects Every QlikView document is made of at least one worksheet called Main. We can add more sheets, which are like many pages of the same QlikView document. Sheets help us display multiple data formats like - multiple charts or multiple tables. Each sheet can contain various sheet objects. In addition, sheets can be rearranged using Promote Sheet/Demote Sheet option and can be removed from the QlikView document using Remove Sheet option. Sheet Properties Sheets have various properties, which can be set to customize the sheets. For example, we can set the name of the sheets and its colors. Right click anywhere in the sheet and choose the Properties option. Then choose the following properties. Sheet Settings ? Color. ? This will set the background colour of the Sheet. Tab Settings ? Custom Colors. ? This will set the color for the Tab where the Sheet name appears. Title. ? This will set the name of the Sheet. Creating Sheet Objects Sheet Objects are the QlikView data elements that are embedded in the sheet. They display the data that is loaded into the QlikView's memory. Each sheet object is tied to a data source and one or more of its columns. Sheet Objects are created from the layout menu as shown below. Using Sheet Objects Sheet Objects display the data from a data source and all the objects in a sheet are associated with each other. Let's create a List Box and a Multi Box and see this association on action. Creating List Box The List box displays data from a column of a table available in QlikView memory. Choose the option List Box from the Add Sheet Objects option and set the properties as given below. Creating Multi Box A Multi Box represents data from multiple columns from a table. Choose the option Multi Box from the Add Sheet Objects option and set the properties as shown below. On completing the above given steps, the following window appears which shows both the objects. Association between Sheet Objects We can see how the sheet objects are linked to each other by choosing the one option from the Multi Box, which highlights the associated row in the List Box. Let us choose "Diapering" under the Product Category drop down list in Multi Box. The window shown below appears. QlikView - Scripting Scripting is a very powerful feature in QlikView, which enables the control of the data load options and data transformations. It enables the use of many inbuilt functions available in QlikView and creates subroutines to be used across multiple scripts within a QlikViewdocument. Scripting is done using the Script Editor. It is accessed from the File menu using Script Editor. We can also press Control +E to open the script editor window. It prepopulates some data formats that are set as default formats for the data to be processed. For example, the Thousand separator is a comma and date is in Month-day-year format. These can be changed to suit the incoming data as per the need. Script Editor Features Script editor has many features, which are accessed from the menu in the script editor window, which is a different menu from the main menu. Given below is a list of important features. File Menu Reload ? Reloads the script and fetches the new data. Upper/Lower Case ? Converts the case of words as QlikView is case sensitive. Comment ? Used to comment blocks of code. Edit Menu Clear Entire Script ? Clears the active script tab. Open Script File ? Opens the saved script files. Table Viewer ? Used to see the tabular view of the data being loaded. Insert Menu Environment Variables ? Inserts a standard list of Environment variables. Script Files ? Allows to browse for script files and insert them. Connect/Disconnect Statement ? Used to connect or disconnect from external databases. Tab Menu Insert Tab ? Inserts a Tab at the current cursor position. Promote/Demote Tab ? Allows to move the tabs from left to right and vice versa. Merge with Previous ?

QlikView - IntervalMatch QlikView IntervalMatch is a powerful function used to match distinct numeric values to numeric intervals. It is useful in analyzing how the events actually happened versus the planned events. The example of a scenario where it is used is in the assembly lines of the production houses where the belts are planned to run at certain times and for certain duration. However, the actual run can happen at different points in time because of breakdown etc. Example Consider an assembly line where there are three belts named A, B and C. They are planned to start & stop at specific times of a day. In a given day, we study the actual start and end time and analyze what all happened in that day. For this, we consider two sets of observations as shown below. 
# Data Set for AssembilyLine.
StartTime,EndTime, BeltNo
00:05,4:20, A
1:50,2:45,B
3:15,10:30,C
	
# Data set for the events happened.

1:10,Start Belt A
2:24,Stop Belt A
3:25,Restart Belt A
4:35,Stop Belt A
2:20,Start Belt B
3:11, Stop Belt B
3:15,Start Belt C

QlikView - Dimensions and Measures Dimensions and Measures are fundamental entities, which are always used in data analysis. For example, consider the result of the analysis, “what is the percentage change in volume of sales for each quarter?” In this case, each quarter represents the Dimensions, which is the name of the quarter. The percentage change in volume represents the Measures, which is a calculation with respect to each value in the dimension. Below are some widely accepted definition of these two terms. Dimension ? It is a descriptive field in the data set which represents few distinct values. Examples ? Month, Year, Product ID etc. Measures ? It is a numeric field on which some calculations are performed for each distinct value of dimension. Input Data Let us consider the following input data, which represents the sales volume and Revenue of different product lines and product categories in different regions. Save the data into a .csv file. 
ProductID,ProductCategory,Region,SalesVolume, Revenue

Next, click on the Straight Table option. Click Next. Choose Dimensions In this screen, we choose Region as the dimension as we want to select the total revenue for each region. Choose Measure The Next screen prompts for applying the calculation on a measure field. We choose to apply Sum on the field Revenue. Final chart On completing the above steps, we get the final chart which shows the total revenue(Measure) for each region(Dimension). QlikView - Star Schema A start schema model is a type of data model in which multiple dimensions are linked to a single fact table. Of course, in bigger models there can be multiple facts tables linked to multiple dimensions and other fact tables. The usefulness of this model lies in performing fast queries with minimal joins among various tables. The fact table contains data, which are measures and have numeric values. Calculations are applied on the fields in the fact table. The unique keys of the dimension tables are used in linking it to the fat table, which also has a key usually with the same field name. Therefore, the Fact table contains the keys from the entire dimension table and forms a concatenated primary key used in various queries. Input Data Given below is a list of tables, which contain the data for different products from various suppliers and regions. Also the supply happens at different time intervals, which are captured in the Time dimension table. Product Dimension It contains the Product Category and Product Names. The Product ID field is the unique Key.

 Star Schema Data Model After reading the above data into QlikView memory, we can look at the data model, which shows all the tables, fields, and relationship in form of a star schema. QlikView - Synthetic Key A Synthetic Key is QlikView's solution to create an artificial key when there is ambiguity about which key to use between two tables. This situation arises when two tables have two or more fields in common. QlikView's feature of creating association in memory automatically detects this scenario and creates an additional table, which will hold the value of the new key created. Input Data Let us consider the following two CSV data files, which are used as input for further illustrations. 
Sales:
ProductID,ProductCategory,Country,SaleAmount
1,Outdoor Recreation,Italy,4579
2,Clothing,USA,4125
3,Costumes & Accessories,South Korea,6521

Product:
ProductID, Country
3,Brazil
3,China
2,Korea
1,USA
 Load Script We load the above input data using the script editor, which is invoked by pressing Control+E. Choose the option Table Files and browse for the Input file. Data Model Next, we look at the data model by using the menu command for table viewer, Control+T. The following screen comes up, which shows the creation of a third table that supplies the value of the synthetic key as both the tables have ProductID and Country as matching keys. Impact of Synthetic key Synthetic keys indicate the flaw in the data model that is being used. They do not cause any issue in the correctness of the data or performance of the report. Things will work fine if a big data model has one or two instances of synthetic keys. However, if we have too many of them, then that is an implication to redesign the data model. QlikView - Generating Data Many times, we need some data to be generated programmatically by the software being used, which is not coming from a source. For example, 100 random numbers or just the dates of 23rd week of a year. A data analyst may need such data to be created to perform some analysis on the data that does not contain these values as it arrived. QlikView provides a function called Autogenerate, which can be used for such requirement. Data Requirement Consider a scenario where we need to find only the dates, which are a Thursday or a Sunday. We need to find it for the range starting today until the end of the year. We create the following script, which will achieve this. Explanation We declare two variables to capture the first day of the current month and end of the year. Next we apply various functions and a filter condition to generate the required values. The recno() function creates one record for each of these dates. We add Autogenerate function giving the variables as the range. Generated data On loading the above script to QlikView's memory and creating a Table Box using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box, we get the data created as shown below. QlikView - Cross Tables While analyzing data, we come across situations where we desire columns to become rows and vice-versa. It is not just about transposing, it also involves rolling up many columns together or repeating many values in a row many times to achieve the desired column and row layout in the table. Input data Consider the following input data, which shows region wise sales of a certain product for each quarter. We create a delimited file (CSV) with the below given data. 
Quarter,Region1,Region2,Region 3
Q1,124,421,471
Q2,415,214,584
Q3,417,321,582
Q4,751,256,95
 Loading Input Data We load the above input data using the script editor, which is invoked by pressing Control+E. Choose the option Table Files and browse for the Input file. After choosing the options as shown below, click Next. Crosstable Options In the next window (File Wizard ? Options), click on the Crosstable button. It highlights the columns in different colors. The pink color shows the qualifier field, which is going to be repeated across many rows for each value of in the Attribute Field. The cell values under the Attribute fields are taken as the data. Click OK. Crosstable Transformation The transformed data appears in which all the Region fields are clubbed to one column but with values repeating for each quarter. Load Script The Load script for the crosstable transformations shows the commands given below. Crosstable Data On creating a Table Box sheet object using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box, we get the following output. QlikView - Straight Tables Straight Tables are most widely used sheet object to display data in QlikView. They are very simple yet powerful with features like column rearrangement, sorting and coloring the background etc. Input Data Let us consider the following input data, which represents the sales figure of different product lines and product categories.

Pivot Chart Data Completing the above steps gives us the final chart as below. QlikView - Set Analysis QlikView's Set Analysis feature is used to segregate the data in different sheet objects into many sets and keeps the values unchanged in some of them. In simpler terms, it creates an option to not associate some sheet objects with others while the default behavior is all sheet objects get associated with each other. This helps in filtering the data in one sheet object and seeing the corresponding result in others, while the sheet object chosen as a different set displays values as per its own filters. Input Data Let us consider the following input data, which represents the sales figure of different product lines and product categories.

 We create a Table Box using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box, where we choose all the three fields - ProductID, ProductCategory and SaleAmount to be displayed. Outer Join Outer join involves fetching all the rows from the table in the right as well as from the table in the left. Load Script 
Sales:
LOAD ProductID, 
     ProductCategory, 
     SaleAmount
FROM
[C:\Qlikview\data\product_lists.csv]
(txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is ',', msq);

OUTER JOIN(Sales)

LOAD ProductID, 
     ProductCategory

 We create a Table Box using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box where we choose all the three fields - ProductID, ProductCategory and SaleAmount to be displayed. QlikView - Keeps The keep command in QlikView is used to combine data from two data sets keeping both the data sets available in memory. It is very similar to joins we covered in the previous chapter except for two major differences. First difference is ? in case of keep; both the datasets are available in QlikView's memory while in join the load statements produce only one data set from which you have to choose the columns. The second difference being ? there is no concept of outer keep where as we have outer join available in case of joins. Input Data Let us consider the following two CSV data files, which are used as input for further illustrations. 
Product List:
ProductID,ProductCategory
1,Outdoor Recreation
2,Clothing
3,Costumes & Accessories
4,Athletics
5,Personal Care
6,Hobbies & Creative Arts

Product Sales:
ProductID,ProductCategory,SaleAmount
4,Athletics,1212
5,Personal Care,5211
6,Hobbies & Creative Arts,1021
7,Display Board,2177
8,Game,1145
9,soap,1012
10,Beverages & Tobacco,2514
 Inner Keep We load the above input data using the script editor, which is invoked by pressing Control+E. Choose the option Table Files and browse for the Input file. Then we edit the commands in the script to create an inner keep between the tables. Inner keep fetches only those rows, which are present in both the tables. In this case, the rows available in both Product List and Product Sales table are fetched. We create a Table Boxes using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box. First, we choose only the productSales table, which gives us the fields - ProductID, ProductCategory and SaleAmount to be displayed. Next, we choose the ProductList data set, which gives us the fields ProductID and ProductCategory. Finally, we choose the All Tables option and get all the available fields from all the tables. The following report shows all the Tables Boxes from the above given steps. Left Keep Left keep is similar to left join, which keeps all the rows from the table in the left along with both the data set being available in QlikView's memory. Left keep Script The following script is used to create the resulting data sets with left keep command. 
productsales:
LOAD ProductID, 
     ProductCategory, 
     SaleAmount
FROM
[C:\Qlikview\data\product_lists.csv]
(txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is ',', msq);

left keep(productsales)
productlists:
LOAD ProductID, 
     ProductCategory
FROM
[C:\Qlikview\data\Productsales.csv]
(txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is ',', msq);
 Left keep Data When we change the script as above and refresh the data in the report using Control+R, we get the following data in the sheet objects. Right Keep Right keep is similar to left join, which keeps all the rows from the table in the right along with both the data set being available in QlikView's memory. Right keep Script The following script is used to create the resulting data sets with left keep command. 
productsales:
LOAD ProductID, 
     ProductCategory, 
     SaleAmount
FROM
[C:\Qlikview\data\product_lists.csv]
(txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is ',', msq);

productlists:
LOAD ProductID, 
     ProductCategory
FROM
[C:\Qlikview\data\Productsales.csv]
(txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is ',', msq);
 Right keep data When we change the script as above and refresh the data in the report using Control+R, we get the following data in the sheet objects. QlikView - Concatenation Concatenation feature in QlikView is used to append the rows from one table to another. It happens even when the tables have different number of columns. It differs from both Join and Keep command, as it does not merge the matching rows from two tables into one row. Input Data Let us consider the following two CSV data files, which are used as input for further illustrations. Please note the second data set has an additional column named Country.

 Load Script We load the above input data using the script editor, which is invoked by pressing Control+E. Choose the option Table Files and browse for the Input file. Then we edit the commands in the script to apply the concatenation between the tables. Next, we load the above data to QlikView's memory and create a Table Box by using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box where we choose all the available fields to be displayed as shown below. Concatenated Data Completing above steps we get the Table box displayed as shown below. Please note the duplicate rows for the product ID 6 and 7. Concatenate does not eliminate the duplicates. QlikView - Master Calendar In QlikView, many times we need to create a calendar reference object, which can be linked to any data set present in QlikView's memory. For example, you have a table that captures the sales amount and sales date but does not store the weekday or quarter, which corresponds to that date. In such a scenario, we create a Master Calendar which will supply the additional date fields like Quarter, Day etc. as required by any data set. Input Data Let us consider the following CSV data files, which are used as input for further illustrations. 
SalesDate,SalesVolume
3/28/2012,3152
3/30/2012,2458
3/31/2012,4105
4/8/2012,6245
4/10/2012,5816
4/11/2012,3522
 Load Script We load the above input data using the script editor, which is invoked by pressing Control+E. Choose the option Table Files and browse for the Input file. Next, we load the above data to QlikView's memory and create a Table Box by using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box where we choose all the available fields to be displayed as shown below. Create Master Calendar Next, we create the Master Calendar by writing the following script in the script editor. Here we use the table DailySales as a resident table from which we capture the Maximum and Minimum dates. We load each of the dates within this range using the second load statement above the resident load. Finally, we have a third load statement, which extracts the year, quarter, month etc. from the SalesDate values. Select Fields After creation of the complete load script along with the master calendar, we create a table box to view the data using the menu Layout ? New Sheet Objects ? Table Box Final Data The final output shows the table showing the Quarter and Month values, which are created using the Sales data and Master Calendar. QlikView - Mapping Tables Mapping table is a table, which is created to map the column values between two tables. It is also called a Lookup table, which is only used to look for a related value from some other table. Input Data Let us consider the following input data file, which represents the sales values in different regions. 
ProductID,ProductCategory,Region,SaleAmount
1,Outdoor Recreation,Europe,4579
2,Clothing,Europe,4125
3,Costumes & Accessories,South Asia,6521
4,Athletics,South Asia,4125
5,Personal Care,Australia,5124
6,Arts & Entertainment,North AMerica,1245
7,Hardware,South America,456
8,Home & Garden,South America,241
9,Food,South Asia,1247
10,Home & Garden,South Asia,5462
11,Office Supplies,Australia,577

 Load Script The above data is loaded to QlikView memory by using the script editor. Open the Script editor from the File menu or press Control+E. Choose the Table Files option from the Data from Files tab and browse for the file containing the above data. Click OK and ess Control+R to load the data into the QlikView's memory. Create Table Box Let us create two table boxes for each of the above table as shown below. Here we cannot get the value of country in the Sales region report. Create the Mapping Table The following script produces the mapping table, which maps the region value from the sales table with the country value from the MapCountryRegion table. Table Chart On completing the above steps and creating a Table box to view the data, we get the country columns along with other columns from Sales table. QlikView - Circular Reference Circular Reference occurs when we can traverse from one table to another using two or more different paths. This means you can join Table1 with Table2 directly using a column or you can also first join Table1 with Table3 and then table3 with Table2. This can lead to incorrect result in the output formed by a data model, which loads all these three tables. QlikView prevents the load of such data into its memory once it recognizes a circular reference. Input Data Let us consider the following three CSV data files, which are used as input for further illustrations. 
SalesCountries:
ProductID,ProductCategory,Country,SaleAmount
1,Outdoor Recreation,Italy,4579
2,Clothing,USA,4125
3,Costumes & Accessories,South Korea,6521

 Load Script We load the above input data using the script editor, which is invoked by pressing Control+E. Choose the option Table Files and browse for the Input file. Data Load After creating the above script, we load the data to QlikView's memory using the command Control+R. This is when we get the error prompt mentioning the presence of circular loop in the tables getting loaded. Data Model To find the exact cause of the above warning we can look at the data model by using the menu command for table viewer - Control+T. The following screen comes up, which clearly shows the circular reference. Here the join between RegionCountry and SalesRegion can be directly achieved using the field Region. It can also be achieved by first going to the table ProductCountry, using the field Country and then mapping ProdcutID with Salesregion. Resolving Circular Reference The above circular reference can be resolved by renaming some of the columns in the data sets so that QlikView does not form an association between the tables automatically using the column names. For this, we will rename country column in RegionCountry to SalesCountry. In the data set ProdcuCountry, we rename the Country column to ProductCountry. Rectified Data Model The Rectified data model after renaming the column above can be seen using the command Control+T. Now we can see that the relationship between the tables does not form a loop. Pressing Control+R to reload the data does not give us the warning anymore and we can use this data to create reports.
