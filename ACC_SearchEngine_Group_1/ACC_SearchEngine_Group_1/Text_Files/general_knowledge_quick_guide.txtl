Gujral April 1997 March 1998 Atal Bihari Vajpayee March 1998 May 2004 Manmohan Singh May 2004 May 2014 Narendra Modi May 2014 Till date General Knowledge - The Universe Pythagoras, who was an Ionian Greek philosopher and mathematician, first used the term “COSMOS” for the order of the Universe. Cosmology is the discipline that describes the large scale properties of the universe as a whole. The distance covered by light in one year is known as “Light Year.” The Velocity of light is 300,000 km/s. The distance between the Sun and the Earth is known as “Astronomical Unit.” One astronomical unit is (roughly) equal to 149.6 million kilometers. Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) is an Explorer Mission of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It is launched for the study and measurement of cosmology. Professor Sir Fred Hoyle, who was an English astronomer, coined the term “Big Bang” to explain a scientific theory on the creation of cosmos. Galaxy is a huge collection of stellar and interstellar matter, which are bound together by its own gravity in the Space. There are several galaxies in the universe, for example, Milky Way. The name galaxy where we live is ‘Milky Way.’ The largest galaxy is ‘Andromeda Galaxy.’ It is also the closest to Milky Way. Milky Way is the second largest galaxy. The radius of Milky Way is about 50,000 light years. The Solar System is a part of Milky Way. The Sun takes 225 million light years to complete one circuit. The collapsed stars, which are immeasurably dense and having huge gravitational force (even light cannot escape rather get absorbed) are known as “Black Holes.” Quasar is a massive and extremely remote celestial object that keeps emitting remarkably large amounts of energy. Typically, it has a star like image, which can be seen through the telescope. Constellation is a group of stars being arranged in a pictorial configuration. It was basically observed by the ancient astronomers. For example, Sirius (Canis Major), Canopus (Carina), Turus (Bootes), etc. Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is the British Astronomy center, located at Chajnantor (at an altitude of about 5,000 meters), in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Edwin Hubble, who was an American astronomer, first studied galaxies in detail. Based on Shape, Edwin classified galaxies as Elliptical, Spiral, and Barred Spiral. At the end of life-cycle, when a star loses its light and the density increases (very high), by this time, it is largely composed of neutrons and hence known as ‘Neutron Star.’ Most likely, the rotating neutron star emits intermittent radio signals, is known as ‘Pulsar.’ A star with low temperature and small mass (glowing feebly) is known as ‘Red Dwarf.’ A star that suddenly increases its brightness (greatly) because of a catastrophic explosion and ejects most of its mass is known as ‘Supernova.’ Satellites (or Moons) are the bodies that keep revolving around their respective planets. For example, Moon revolves around the Earth, etc. The Sun is the closest star to the Earth (at the distance of about 149,600,000 km). Located at the distance of about 4.24 light-years, Proxima Centauri is the second closest star to the Earth. The Sun is made up of extremely hot gasses and its glowing surface is known as the ‘Photosphere.’ The layer immediately above the photosphere is known as ‘Chromosphere’ (sphere of color). The Chromosphere is 10,000 km thick transparent shell of plasma. The Outermost layer of the Sun is known as the ‘Corona.’ Temperature of the outer surface is 6,0000 C and interior temperature is 15,000,0000 C. The rotation period of the Sun is 25 days, 9 hours, and 7 minutes. The traveling speed of the Sun’s Rays is 30,000 m/s. The time taken by Sun’s Rays to reach the Earth is 8 minutes and 16.6 seconds. The Sun is largely composed (chemically) of Hydrogen (71%), Helium (26.5%), and some other elements (2.5%). Sometimes, in the photosphere, some patches of gas, which is cooler that its surrounding (gas) are known as the ‘Sunspots.’ The Planets are the celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun as well as (at the same time) rotate on their imaginary axis. General Knowledge - Solar System There are eight planets namely (arranged in the order of increasing distance from the Sun) ? Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune The largest planet is Jupiter and Mercury is the smallest planet of the system. Mercury Mercury is the nearest to the Sun. Mercury takes 58.65 Earth days to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 88 days to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Mercury is the fastest planet and it has no moon (satellite). Venus Venus, which is also popular as an evening star and morning star, is the brightest celestial body in the universe after Sun and Moon. Venus is the Hottest Planet of the solar system. It is closest to the Earth. Venus takes 243 Earth days to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 224.7 days to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Venus has no satellite and it spins in the opposite direction of the Earth’s spin. Venus is named after the Roman goddess of Beauty. Earth Earth is the third planet from the Sun. By the time, Earth is the only planet where life exists. Earth takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 40 seconds to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 365.26 days to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Mass of the Earth is 5.98 x 1024 kg and its diameter is 12,756 km. Escape Velocity of the Earth is 11,200 m/s. Obliquity (i.e. tilt of axis degrees) of the Earth is 23.40. Mean density of the Earth is 5.514 g/cm3 and the surface is 510,072,000 km2. Mean surface temperature of the Earth is 281 K; the mean maximum surface temperature is 310 K and the mean minimum surface temperature is 260 K. The major atmospheric components of the Earth are Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (20.95%), Argon (0.930%), and Carbon Dioxide (0.039%). Moon Moon is the only known satellite of the Earth. Moons rotation time (on its axis) and revolution time (around the Earth) is same (i.e. 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, and 11.47 seconds. This is the reason that we always see only one side of the Moon. Moon revolves around the Earth once in every 27.3 days, which is known as ‘Sidereal Month;’ however, it takes 29.5 days to return to the same point on the celestial sphere in reference to the Sun (due to revolution motion of the Earth around the Sun) and it is known as ‘Synodic Month.’ When two full Moons occur in the same month, it is known as ‘Blue Moon.’ A Full Moon is basically the lunar phase that occurs when the Moon is completely illuminated as seen from the Earth. As shown in the following image, the Lunar Phase or phase of the moon, is the shape of the illuminated portion of the Moon that is visible from the Earth. As Moon revolves, the lunar phases change cyclically and we can see from the full moon (full visible) to the new moon (not at all visible). Mars Mars is known as the ‘Red Planet’ of the solar system. Mars takes 24 hours, 37 minutes, and 30 seconds to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 687 days to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Mars has two satellites namely Phobos (means fear) and Deimos (means terror). Jupiter Jupiter takes 9 hours, 50 minutes, and 30 seconds to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 12 earth years to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Jupiter has 63 natural satellites/moon, significant of them are Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, etc. Among all, Ganymede is the largest satellite in the whole solar system. Saturn Saturn is the largest planet after Jupiter in the solar system. Saturn is popular for its spectacular rings system. The rings system of Saturn is made up of a variety of separate particles that rotate in circular orbits independently. Saturn takes 10 hours and 14 minutes to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 30 years to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Saturn has total 47 satellites/moons; among them, Titan is the biggest satellite. Uranus Uranus is first identified as planet by William Herschel in 1781. Like Saturn, Uranus also has a system of five faint rings. Uranus takes 16 hours to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 84 years to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Uranus has 27 satellites; significant of them are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, etc. Neptune Neptune is the farthest planet which appears greenish through a telescope. Neptune is discovered by Berlin scientist J. G. Galle in 1846. Neptune takes 18 hours to complete its rotation (on its axis) and takes 165 years to complete its one revolution (i.e. in its orbit around the Sun). Neptune has 13 satellites/moons; significant of them are ‘Triton’ and ‘Nereid.’ Until 2006, there were nine planets (including Pluto), but in 2006, the ninth planet Pluto is categorized as the dwarf planet by International Astronomical Union (IAU). Asteroids Asteroids, also known as small planets or planetoids, are the rocky debris largely found between the planets Mars and Jupiter. These are too small to have their own atmosphere (as shown in the following image). The Asteroids revolve around the Sun, which varies from 3 to 10 years. By the time, more than 450,000 Asteroids are discovered; the largest Asteroid is Ceres, which diameter is about 1,025 km. Meteors Meteors, also popular as ‘Shooting Star’ or ‘Falling Star,’ is the passage of a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid into the Earth's atmosphere. It is heated (because of the collisions with air particles) and normally seen in the upper atmosphere (as shown in the following image). Meteoroids are the small rocky or metallic bodies that normally travel through outer space. Meteoroids are expressively smaller than asteroids, and its size ranges from small grains to 1-meter-wide objects. Comets Comets are the icy small Solar System body; normally while passing close to the Sun, heats up and starts to outgas, displaying a visible atmosphere (i.e. basically coma) along with a tail (as shown in the following image – in the insat view). General Knowledge - Basics of Planet Earth Total surface area of the Earth is 510,100,500 sq. km, out of which ? The total land area is 148,950,800 sq. km (29.08% of total area) and The total water area is 361,149,700 sq. km (70.92%). Diameter of the Earth at Equator is 12,755 km, at the poles 12,712 km, and mean diameter is 12,734 km. Circumference of the Earth at Equator is 40,075 km and at the poles 40,024 km. Equatorial radius of the Earth is 6,377 km. The total mass of the Earth is 5.98 x 1024 kg. Approximate age of the Earth is 4,500 million years. The mean velocity of the Earth in its orbit (around the Sun) is 107,218 km/h. The most abundant elements of the Earth are Iron (about 32.5%), Oxygen (29.8%), Silicon (15.6%), and Magnesium (13.9%) Structure of Earth The Earth is structured in three layers namely ? Crust, Mantle, and Core – Further classified as outer core (fluid layer) and inner core (solid layer). The Crust is the uppermost layer of the Earth, largely composed of rocks. Its thickness ranges from 5 km to 60 km and density ranges from 2.7 to 3. The Crust shares about 1 percent of Earth’s volume. The Crust is categorized as ‘Continental Crust’ and ‘Oceanic Crust.’ The thickness of Continental Crust ranges from 30 km to 50 km. It is largely composed by granites, which density (i.e. 2.7) is lesser than the Oceanic Crust. The thickness of Oceanic Crust ranges from 5 km to 10 km and it is composed primarily of basalt, diabase, and gabbro. The density of Oceanic Crust is 3.0. The most abundant element of Crust is Oxygen (46.6%) followed by Silicon (27.7%) and Aluminum (8.1%). The Crust is also known as ‘Sial’ (i.e. Silicon and Aluminum) The boundary between the Crust and the Mantle is known as the “Mohorovi?i? Discontinuity.” The Mantle is located between the Crust and the (Outer) Core, which thickness is about 2885 km. The Mantle shares about 83% of the Earth’s volume and about 65% of the mass. The density of Mantle is about 3.4 g/cm3. The upper layer of Mantle is known as ‘Asthenosphere.’ The Crust and the upper part of Mantle collectively known as ‘Lithosphere.’ The Core is mostly composed of iron and nickel; therefore, it is also known as ‘Nife’ (i.e. Nickel and Ferrous). The Core shares about 16% of Earth’s total volume and 30% of the mass. The thickness of the Core is about 3,400 km from the Mantle (likewise, the total depth from the Surface of the Earth is 6,300 km). Core is categorized as outer core (which is in molten state) and inner core (which is in solid state). Density of the inner core is about 13 g/cm3.

The Earth’s revolution (in its orbit around the Sun) causes change in seasons. When nights and days are equal is known as ‘Equinoxes.’ During the equinox’s time, the Sun shines exactly over the equator. March 21 (of every year) is known as the vernal (spring) equinox and September 23 (of every year) is known as the autumnal equinox. When the difference between the length of day and night is maximum is known as ‘Solstice.’ During the solstice time, the Sun shines over the tropics (either on Tropic of Cancer or Tropic Capricorn). 23.500 North represents ‘Tropic of Cancer.’ On June 21, the Sun shines over the Tropic of Cancer and it is known as the longest day of the year. June 21 is known as the Summer Solstice. 23.500 South represents ‘Tropic of Capricorn.’ On December 21, the Sun shines over the Tropic of Capricorn and it is known as the longest night of the year. December 21 is known as Winter Solstice. When light of a celestial body is obscured by another celestial body, the situation is known as ‘Eclipse.’ When the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, it is known as “Lunar Eclipse.” When the Moon come between the Sun and the Earth, it is known as “Solar Eclipse.” General Knowledge - Atmosphere The composition of the Earth’s atmosphere changes with the altitude. The major constituents of the Earth’s atmosphere are ? Nitrogen – 78.09% Oxygen – 20.95% Argon – 0.93% Carbon Dioxide – 0.039% (remaining other gasses) The pressure exerted by the weight of air at a given point is known as “Atmospheric Pressure” or “Barometric Pressure.” With increasing altitude, the atmospheric pressure decreases. On an average, a column of air (which is normally one square centimeter in cross-section), measured at the sea level, has the weight of about 1.03 kg (about 10.1 N). The Average Air Pressure is about 14.70 pounds per square inch, (equivalent to 1,013.25 × 103 dynes per square centimeter or 1,013.25 millibars) at the sea level. A visible mass of condensed vapor floating above the general level of the ground is known as Cloud. Based on the altitude, cloud is classified as ? High Altitude Cloud: For example, Cirrus, Cirrocumulus, & Cirrostratus. Middle Altitude Cloud: For example, Altostratus and Altocumulus. Low Altitude Cloud: Stratus, Stratocumulus, Cumulus, and Nimbostratus (it can be also seen in the middle altitude). Vertical: Cumulonimbus GK - Structure of Atmosphere The structure of the atmosphere is classified into the following layers ? Troposphere: 0 to 12 km Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km Troposphere Troposphere is the closest to the Earth’s surface and contains water vapor (clouds), moisture, dust, etc. Most of the weather phenomena take place in Troposphere. Height of the Troposphere varies i.e. at the equator, it is measured about 18 km and at the poles, it is 12 km. Tropopause is the transitional zone that separates Troposphere and Stratosphere. Stratosphere Stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of the Earth’s Atmosphere that goes up to 50 km. Stratosphere contains Ozone (O3) Layer that absorbs the ultraviolet rays (coming through the Sun rays) and protects life on the Earth. As the ultraviolet radiation absorbs in Stratosphere, therefore the temperature rises with increasing altitude. The Stratopause is the transitional zone that separates Stratosphere and Mesosphere. Mesosphere Mesosphere, present above the Stratosphere, extends up to (from 50 km to) 80 km. Temperature in the Mesosphere decreases with increasing altitude. Mesopause is the transitional zone that separates Mesosphere and Thermosphere. Thermosphere Above the Mesosphere, Thermosphere is the second-highest layer that starts at the altitude of 80 km and extends up to (roughly) 700 km (however, it varies between 500 and 1000 km). The lower part of the Thermosphere (roughly between 80 km and 550 km) contains ions and known as Ionosphere. The temperature of the Thermosphere rises with increasing altitude. Thermopause is the transitional zone that separates Thermosphere and Exosphere. Exosphere Exosphere is the highest or outermost layer of the Earth’s atmosphere that extends (starting from 700 km altitude) up to 10,000 km where it ultimately merges into the solar wind. Major constituents of the Exosphere are helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. The phenomena of Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis can be seen in the lower part of the Exosphere (merged with upper part of the Thermosphere). The Satellite (orbiting the Earth) is normally placed in the Exosphere (as shown in the image given above). General Knowledge - Wind System Air in motion is known as wind. Wind plays a significant role in determining the weather system of a given region. Because of the rotation of the Earth, wind deflects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. The phenomena first reported by Coriolis and hence it is known as Coriolis Force. To read the wind direction, weather vanes are used; however, at the airport, windsocks are used (indicated the wind direction). Anemometer is used to measure the wind speed. Types of Winds Winds normally are categorized as ? Primary Winds: It is also known as Prevailing Winds and Planetary Winds. Secondary winds: It is also known as Periodic Winds and Seasonal Winds. Local Winds: It is originated because of the local temperature and/or pressure difference. Major Planetary Winds (as shown in the following image) are ? Polar Easterlies Westerlies (Mid-latitude) Trade Winds (Tropics) Seasonal or Periodic Winds blow periodically i.e. for a specific period. For example, Monsoons (as shown in the following image). Local Winds, which are originated largely because of the temperature differences are a localized phenomenon. The following map shows the major local winds of the world ?

General Knowledge - Other Winds Jet Streams Jet streams are narrow and meandered strip of fast blowing air currents found in the upper altitude (i.e. upper troposphere or lower stratosphere). El Niño El Niño, also known as El Niño Southern Oscillation (or ENSO), refers to the cycle of warm and cold temperatures, as measured by sea surface temperature, of the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean. However, the cool phase of ENSO is known as "La Niña." El Niño is accompanied by high air pressure in the western Pacific and low air pressure in the eastern Pacific (as shown in the following image). Cyclone Cyclone is a large-scale air mass that keeps rotating around a strong center of low pressure. It rotates counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. In the northeastern Pacific oceans and the Atlantic Ocean, the tropical cyclone is known as “Hurricane.” In the Indian and south Pacific Oceans, the tropical cyclone is called as “Cyclone,” and in the northwestern Pacific Ocean it is known as “Typhoon.” In the South Indian Ocean (specifically South-west of Australia), a tropical cyclone is known as “Willy-Willy.” Anticyclone Anticyclone is a large-scale wind system that circulates around a central region of high atmospheric pressure. It rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere (the following image illustrates the comparative structure of cyclone and anti-cyclone).

Rock is divided into following three types ? Igneous Rocks Sedimentary Rock Metamorphic Rock Igneous Rock Igneous Rock is normally formed by the solidification of the molten magma. All other types of rocks are formed by the igneous rock; therefore, igneous rock is also known as primary rock. About 95% of the Earth’s crust is made of igneous rock. Granite, Basalt, and Volcanic rock are the major types of igneous rock. Sedimentary Rock The rocks, which is formed because of the deposition of weathered remains of igneous rocks, is known as ‘Sedimentary Rock.’ Sedimentary rocks share 5% of the Earth’s surface, but cover (in terms of area) about 75% of Earth’s (exposed) surface. Sedimentary rocks also contain organic materials (i.e. source of energy for the human beings). Major examples of sedimentary rocks are Gypsum, Limestone, Chalk, Coal, Conglomerates, Sandstone, Claystone, etc. Metamorphic Rock Because of the intense pressure, high fluctuating temperature, and presence and absence of moisture and chemicals, over a period of time, igneous rock or sedimentary rocks get modified (metamorphosed) and called as ‘Metamorphic Rock.’ Major examples of metamorphic rock are Slate, Gneiss, Marble, Quartzite, etc. General Knowledge - Mountains Mountain is a large natural elevation of the earth's surface that rises abruptly from the surrounding area.

About 97.5% (of total hydrosphere) is saline water and rest 2.5% is fresh water. About 68.7% of the fresh water is available in the form of permanent snow found in the regions of Arctic, Antarctic, and other mountain glaciers. About 29.9% fresh water is available in the form of (fresh) groundwater. Only about 0.26% fresh water is easily accessible for the use, available in the form of rivers, lakes, reservoirs, etc. Oceans There are five Oceans namely ?

Local time (of any place) is measured in reference to Greenwich Time (London), which changes at the rate of four min/degree of longitude. Greenwich Time Line is also known as “Prime Meridian” i.e. 00. International Standard Time is measured in reference of the Prime Meridian (or Greenwich). The Earth rotates through 3600 in 24 hours or 150 in 1 hour or 10 in 4 minutes. Therefore, the local time varies at the rate of 4 min/degree of longitude from the Greenwich Time. As shown in the map given above, Kolkata is approximately 900 east of Greenwich; so, Kolkata is (900 x 4 = 360 min) six hours ahead of the Greenwich Time (London).
