Guest Cycle in Hotel Generally, a guest’s interaction with the hotel is divided into the following four sequential phases ? Pre-arrival It is the stage when the customer is planning to avail an accommodation in the hotel. In this first stage, the customer or the prospective guest enquires about the availability of the desired type of accommodation and its amenities via telephonic call or an e-mail. The customer also tries to find out more information about the hotel by visiting its website. At the hotel end, the front office accounting system captures the guest’s information such as name, age, contact numbers, probable duration of stay for room reservation and so on. Arrival The front office reception staff receives the guest in the reception. The porters bring in the guest luggage. For the guest with confirmed reservation, the front office clerk hands over a Guest Registration Card (GRC) to the guest and requests the guest to fill in personal information regarding the stay in the hotel. The clerk then registers the guest in the database thereby creating a guest record and a guest account along with it. Later, the clerk hands over a welcome kit and keys of the accommodation. After the procedure of registration, the guest can start occupying the accommodation. Occupancy During occupancy, a front office accounting system is responsible for tracking guest charges against his/her purchases from the hotel restaurants, room service, bar, or any outgoing telephone calls made via the hotel’s communication systems. The front office staff is responsible to manage and issue the right keys of the accommodations to the right guests. On guests’ request, the staff also makes arrangement for transportation, babysitting, or local touring while the guest is staying in the hotel. Departure During guest departure, the front office accounting system ensures payment for goods and services provided. If a guest’s bill is not completely paid, the balance is transferred from guest to non-guest records. When this occurs, collection becomes the responsibility of the back office accounting division. At the time of guest departure, the front office staff thanks the guest for giving an opportunity to serve and arrange for handling luggage. In addition, if the guest requires airport or other drop service, the front office bell desk fulfils it.

Being the prime interface between the hotel services and the guests, the front office is located near the main entrance of the hotel. The front office structure can be viewed in two ways: the physical setup and the operational structure of the department. Physical Setup of Front Office The physical setup includes key-hanging boards, bell desk and guest-mail handling register. The front desk is equipped with various compartments, the computerized property management system, and an in-house communication system.

The front office department needs to react to the enquiry of the guests. For a guest, reservation increases the chances of a better deal for assured accommodation on arrival. For a hotel, reservation can enable a better management of guest experience during usual as well as peak seasons. Reservation procedure varies depending on the size and brand of the hotel and the reservation system employed. Let us know the details how the front office handles reservations. Types of Hotel Reservation Systems An efficient and effective reservation system is what adds to the hotel’s profitability. Following are the most popular reservation systems ? Whitney System of Reservation It was developed in 1940 by Whitney Paper Corporation from New York, hence the name. This is a conventional manual reservation system the hotels used to follow during pre-computer days in the hotels. It contains the following setup for reservation ? Slip for request of accommodation reservation Whitney slip that records guest name, accommodation type, number, and duration of stay Temporary/Permanent arrival slip Guest bill Guest registration card Correspondence file Bedroom journal that records daily occupancy of the guest with date, guest name, room type, and room number Let us see how a Whitney slip and the bedroom journal looks like. Whitney Slip Guest Name Date of Arrival Room Type Room Rate Date of Departure Mode of Reservation Reserved By Date Received Reservation Agency if Any: Billing Instructions Date of Confirmation Bedroom Journal Date: ___________ Guest Name Room Number Room Particulars Though this system proved efficient, it generated a lot of paperwork with occasional scope for errors. The drawbacks were overcome by the central reservation system. Central Reservation System (CRS) It is a computerized reservation system that reduces paperwork and can handle large amount of reservation data effortlessly. In this system, since the guest data and reservation data are stored on the storage disks of the computers, it can be accessed at wish. It is stored in the form of a database of collection of records which can enable searching, adding, removing, or updating any guest related data. The computerized reservation system not only helps to make guest reservations but also helps to forecast how many accommodations can be reserved in an upcoming time period. This is how a CRS typically works ? The guests of hotel sales agents call for checking room availability. It is forwarded to the front office reservation staff. The staff finds out details about the requirement and checks the availability of desired accommodation in the database. According to the reservation policies and procedures, the reservation staff member then notifies or suggests the reception about the accommodation availability and takes further appropriate action. The Role of Internet in Reservation The Internet has brought a momentum in the hospitality business as well. It facilitates seamless management of a hotel’s offices located at various places and their various departments. The hotel businesses are actively working on the Internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Internet has simplified complex system of reservations. It enables Online Hotel Management Systems (OHMS) such as Hotelogix to help guests reserve accommodation of their choice fast and conveniently. The guests of the hotel can access rate charts, accommodation availability, check-in and check-out timings, details about the restaurants, and so on, at their own convenience. Sources of Reservations People travel for various reasons such as personal as well as for MICE. There are various sources from whom the requests of reservation pour in ? Direct Request from Guests ? The prospective guests can approach individually to the hotel for reservation of accommodation mostly when they are single travelers or family travelers. Request from Travel Agent ? They can approach the hotel for booking accommodations for group travelers. Request from Corporate Agent ? An organization can request a hotel to reserve accommodations for their employees, clients, or visitors. Request from Airlines ? The airlines can reserve accommodations for their working staff for routine stay as well as in case of flight cancellations. Request from Institutions ? Various SMERF or NGO institutions request to reserve hotels for sports people, delegations of embassies, or performing-art program groups, workshop groups, and alike who travel to different location. Managing Reservations The first step in reserving an accommodation is to check if the requested kind of accommodation is available for selling for a specific period of time. It is done by checking forecast boards or computerized systems. Accepting Reservation of Accommodation Reservation of an accommodation is accepted if the desired type of accommodation is available in the hotel for selling. If it is not available during a rush season or if the guest is in urgent need, the staff member suggests for almost similar alternative accommodation by stating its amenities and facilities. Reservation is accepted in the following cases in conjunction with the availability of the accommodation ? Is the guest new to the hotel? Does the guest have good credentials with the hotel regarding payment and behavior? Is the guest a VIP? Denying Reservation of Accommodation Denial of reservation directly means loss of revenue. But there are certain situations when the reservation staff turns down the reservation for the guests or agents. The potential causes of denying reservation are ? All accommodations in hotel booked ? In such case, the reservation staff refuses the reservation politely and suggests an alternative hotel in the same area or different property of the same owner in a nearby area. Requested type of accommodation not available ? In such case, the reservation staff suggests an alternate accommodation. Guest/Agent blacklisted ? Some guests or agents are blacklisted due to their history of payment dues against the hotel. In such case, the reservation clerk seeks for reservation manager’s advice. Finally, the reservation section of the front office prepares the list of the reservations for the day and sends it to the front desk. The list also contains vital information such as if the guest is new or repeat, guest preferences about room location or décor. The rooms are then prepared by housekeeping. Cancelling a Reservation of Accommodation This is yet another event when the hotel loses business with a guest. Though the fact is overt loss of revenue, the front office staff must react to it politely and gracefully. The staff member also needs to convey any cancellation charges the guest must pay while cancelling the reservation. Cancellation is done in the following steps ? Finding out details of the guest and respective reserved accommodation. Verifying charges of cancellation, if any. Notifying the guest about cancellation charges. Cancelling the reservation in the system. Updating the system for accommodation availability. Confirming the guest about the cancellation. Generating Reservation Report Reservation reports are generated for the sake of helping the management find trends and making forecast about business. The reports typically are of the following types ? Occupancy report Special arrival report Revenue forecast report Turnaway report Guest Registration Guest registration is nothing but recording the guest’s information for official purposes. At the time of reservation, the front office staff asks the guests to enter their personal information on the GRC. Registration activity is mandatory for both; the guest with reserved accommodation as well as for the walk-in guest. During registration, the guest is required to enter important information on the GRC such as guest name, contact number, purpose of stay at the hotel, and passport and visa details in case of foreign guest. It is the responsibility of the front office staff not to reveal the guest information to unauthorized persons. Let us learn more about registration. Pre-registration Procedure This procedure involves the prospective guests enquiring about the availability of desired type of accommodation. Registration can also be conducted in advance before arrival. It can be done via telephonic conversation in case of frequent guests, VIPs, or group guests. In case of new walk-in guest, pre-registration is absent as there is no prior interaction between the guest and the hotel. Pre-registration activity accelerates the actual registration process where the desired accommodation is marked as reserved. Verifying Guest's Identity Since terror attacks on 9/11, the hotels are mandatorily verifying guests’ identities. The staff verifies guest’s identity first by politely asking the guest’s name. The staff member then requests to show a photo ID such as driving license or a valid identity card from a well-known organization where the guest is working. If the guests are from a foreign country, the staff requests them to show passport. The staff member is authorized to ask any verifying questions politely. The true copies of the passport or ID card are made to verify the guest’s identity and to prepare guest database. Registration Card Typical Format Following is a typical format of a registration card ? Registration Card Date: Reservation Number: Hotel Name: Hotel Address: Contact Number: Email: Fax: Guest Name: Address: Mobile Number: Landline Number: Organization: Arrived from: Passport Details: Visa Details: Date of Issue: Date of Issue: Date of Expiry: Date of Expiry: Place of Issue: Place of Issue: Visa Type: Payment Option: Cash Card Cheque Card Type: Visa Master Other Card Details: Card Number: Date of Expiry: Hotel Policies:   Guest SignatureFront Office Signature Creating Registration Record When the guests arrive at the hotel, the front desk staff hands over the GRC to the guest to fill up the information. In case of VIPs, the staff enters the information on the card and receives the guest’s signature. The staff then creates a registration record of the guest, countersigns, attaches the true copies of the passport or other ID cards, and files this set in the guest history file. The guest reservation record is created as a registration record in the software system. Establishing Payment Method Guests can pay in advance or at the time of checking-out. Those who have paid in advance are put under Paid-In-Advance (PIA) list. There are various modes of payment out of which a mode that guest prefers is recorded at the time of registration. Following payment methods are available ? Cash Payment (which also include money order, travelers’ cheque). Credit Card/Debit Card Payment (which are accepted only if the cards have not expired). Cheque Payment (where post-dated cheques are not accepted). Direct Billing. Special Payment such as gift card and voucher. The guests need to select one of the options of payment at the time of registration. Assigning an Accommodation The front office staff assigns an accommodation to the guest only when the registration is complete. The staff member records the accommodation number into the PMS and describes about its positive attributes briefly. The reservations staff also informs the bell-boy to take the guest luggage. Issuing Room Keys or Access Code After the accommodation is assigned, the front office staff gives away the keys or the computerized secret code keys for accessing the accommodation. It is a general practice to not to speak anything about the room number or the computerized key loudly while giving it to the guest. The bell attendant then assists the guest with luggage handling to the accommodation and explaining the accommodation features. The attendant then gives the keys to the guest, greets for best stay, and leaves the accommodation by closing the door. Handling Special Requests If the guest is not satisfied with the accommodation for any unsatisfactory or unpleasant reasons, the bell attendant can bring this to the notice of the front desk staff. In addition, if the guest has special requirements such as a cradle for a baby or hot water bag or a shaving kit and alike, the front office staff is obliged to fulfil the request on time.

Management Account Some hotels allow the managers to entertain the guests’ queries or grievances, or any possibility of acquiring a business deal over a brief interaction with the guests. For example, if a guest has some problem about the hotel policy, the manager calls the guest for interaction over a coffee or a drink and tries to resolve the same. The expenses towards this interaction are then recorded on the management account. Folios and Types A folio is a statement of all transaction that has taken place in a single account. The front office staff records all the transactions between the guest and the hotel on the folio. The folio is opened with zero initial balance. The balance in the folio then increases or decreases depending upon the transactions. At the time of check-out, the folio balance must return to zero on settlement of payment.

This is popularly known as account Settlement using Direct Billing. In direct billing account settlement, the front office staff verifies guest folios and transfers the guest account to non-guest or city account. The hotel’s back-office accounting verifies the guest folios and is responsible to collect the direct billing amount from a direct billing agency such as embassy, university, or organizations. The accounting section also notifies the guests that if the direct billing agency fails or refuses to pay the charges then the guests need to settle the account by paying them from their pocket. Combined Account Settlement ? A guest can settle account by paying partial amount in cash and remaining amount on credit. The front office staff needs to prepare the supporting document for such kind of payment and hands it over to the back-office accounts.

Use simple and correct language. Use a language that can be understood by everyone. If you need to talk to your colleague in the presence of guest, talk in a standard language of communication. Speak only if it is going to be useful to the guests and colleagues. Always speak by maintaining eye contact with the listener. In case your conversation is interrupted, continue it with a short recap of what has been already discussed. While you listen, always pay undivided attention to the speaker. Communicate to understand; not to react. If the guest asks you to arrange for too many things, then repeat them for confirming. Ask politely if you have missed to hear any point the guest or the colleague is putting forward. Don’ts of Hotel Communication Do not use jargon or words such as “hmm-hmm”, “yep”, and alike. Instead, use “perfect”, “absolutely”, and similar words. Do not speak too fast, too slow, or in too low or high voice. Do not interrupt the speaker. Do not speak with the colleagues, if it is not related to the business during working hours. Do not speak under assumptions. Do not hastily arrive at the conclusion unless you know. Do not run around the area of work. Do not appear harsh with your subordinates. Do not appear untidy on work.

 Front Office Management - SOPs In any business organization, common procedures occur in sequence. They are linear. In addition, some procedures also repeat over a time. The organization needs to find out such linear and repeating procedures to compile them into sets of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These procedures when compiled step by step, can prove to be an excellent learning material for training the newly joined staff in a short period of time.

Ensure with the guest that nothing perishable is there in the luggage. Store the luggage on the designated departure area. If the guest is leaving the hotel immediately after check-out, then bring the luggage to the lobby. If a transport vehicle is ready to go then place the luggage in the vehicle. Request the guest to verify the loaded luggage. Update the departure luggage movement on the Daily Luggage movement register. SOP for Handling Reservation Request The SOP goes as follows ?

Handling Wakeup Call Automatically Most hotels facilitate their guests to set automatic wakeup call using their phones or televisions. The housekeeper must ensure that the printed instructions about setting an automatic call are kept handy and visible. The guest can set automatic call which is notified at the PBX system and the PMS system. Even if the guest has set up an automatic call, it is the responsibility of the front office staff to give a manual wakeup call to the guest to avoid any chances of inconvenience. SOP for Guest Check-out The process of checking out generally is initiated by the guest. The guest calls up front office and asks to keep the bill ready. The guest arrives at the front desk.

Send the cancellation charges plus cancellation number to the guest by e-mail. SOP for Controlling Guest Room Keys The front office staff needs to manage at least two sets of the keys. The number of sets may vary according to the guest policy. Accommodation numbers are not written on the keys, which creates problems when the keys are misplaced within or around the premises. Giving Accommodation Key to the Guest Request for the guest’s last name and accommodation number. Check the information told by the guest against the one recorded in PMS. If there is any deviation, request the guest to provide photo ID card. Do not give away the accommodation key without proper authentication. If the doubt about the guest arises and the guest refuses to cooperate, then inform the front office manager immediately. If any other superior front office staff member recognizes the guest, then you can give away the duplicate key. If the guest has lost the key and needs a new one, then ascertain that the guest has lost it. In the above case, program a new key with the same code. Present the newly created key to the guest. You must not issue accommodation keys to any person that claims to be sent by the guest for getting the keys. Yet, you can give them to a non-guest, if the guest has sent the person with a written authority letter addressed to the front office team. In such case, confirm by calling the guest and accompany the non-guest to the accommodation. Giving Occupied Accommodation’s Key to Staff The authorized staff on duty is allowed to access the occupied guest accommodation for the purpose of professional work. For example, the keys can be given for preparing vacated accommodation, laundry staff, mini-bar staff, and bell-boy to take out the guest luggage. SOP for Turning Away Reservation Request One thing for sure, always try to solve the guest’s accommodation problem as far as possible. Try selling hotel service by giving options than plainly denying to what the guest wants. There are a number of reasons why a reservation staff needs to turn down the reservation request. These are few important ones ? The hotel is fully booked during busy seasons. Guest is not interested to reserve after knowing rates. The type of accommodation the guest desires is not available. This is how you turn down a reservation gracefully ? When the guest calls to enquire, answer the call as, “Good (morning, evening), this is own_name from reservations. How may I help you?” The guest says he/she would like to reserve an accommodation. Reply as, “Certainly (Sir/Madam). May I request you for your name, mobile number and email ID please?” The guest tells the same. Further ask, “And your company/travel agency name is?” The guest replies, “I am from (Company/TA name)”. Ask the guest about check-in and check-out dates required for reservation. Request the guest to hold the line till you search for availability of the desired accommodation. Inform the guest approximately how much time you would take to find out. Put the call on hold and check availability. Convey the non-availability of the desired type of accommodation to the guest politely as, “Sorry sir/madam, “(all the accommodations are occupied/the desired type of accommodation is not available)”. Suggest the guest about a nearby sister-concern hotel, if any. Suggest the guest to take other similar kind of accommodation by describing its amenities. If the guest doesn’t agree to it, turn away politely as, “Sorry sir, then we don’t have any other available accommodation.” Record the guest data in the PMS along with the ‘Turn away’ reason. Information System Hotel business is of a kind that needs to provide a myriad range of services to its guests such as food, accommodation, transport, recreational services, and so on. Since the front office contributes major portion in coordinating the services requested by the guests, it needs a system that can help the front office staff to sell services and track them seamlessly and simultaneously. The front office information system includes mainly the property management system. Let us see, what PMS is and how useful it is for handling hotel management functions smoothly. What is a Property Management System? A Property Management System (PMS) is a software system employed to handle basic objectives of all the departments in the hotel business and coordinate functions between them for optimum business outcomes. Why is PMS Required? A PMS is required for the hotel staff for the following reasons ? It integrates all critical operations of the hotel on one platform.
