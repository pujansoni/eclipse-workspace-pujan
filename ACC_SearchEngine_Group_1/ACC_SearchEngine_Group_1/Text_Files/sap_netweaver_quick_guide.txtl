SAP NetWeaver - Transport Management Transport Management System (TMS) is one of the key components in the SAP system and is used to control the new requests, to monitor the changes such as who has implemented the changes, as well as defining and configuring system landscape in SAP environment. Transport Management System consists of 3 parts ? Change and Transport Organizer (CTO) Transaction: SE01 This is used to manage, configure the changes in SAP repository and other objects. This provides a central environment for the development and configuration projects. (https://wiki.scn.sap.com) Transport Management System This is used to manage, control, and copy the development objects and for the customization to perform in SAP system landscape, using transport routes configured with RFC Connections. This includes exporting the objects from one SAP system and importing to the target system. Tools Tools are part of SAP Kernel and are used to manage R3trans and transport control program. R3trans is known as SAP system transport, which is used to transport the objects between different SAP systems. It is called with transport control program (tp) or by using SAP upgrade utilities. Transport control program is used to support data and object transport between different systems running on a different platform and also on a different database. Configuring Transport Management Transport management is one of the key components in the SAP system landscape. Transport Domain Controller This is used to manage all TMS configuration details. Any changes to configuration setting are distributed to all the systems. To set up the Domain controller, use Transaction: STMS In case, SAP system doesn’t have a Domain Controller, you will be prompted to create a new one. Transport domain includes the following activities to be performed ? User creation TMSADM RFC connection and request creation, TMSADM is used to login to the target system DOMAIN.CFG file is created under usr/sap/trans/bin directory, which stores TMS configuration and is used by systems and domains for checking the existing configurations. Adding a System to the Transport Domain To add a system, log on to the SAP system that you want to add to the system. Use client 000 and start transaction STMS. If the system is not added, TMS will check the configuration file DOMAIN.CFG and will ask to join the domain. Click “Select the proposal” and save. The System will remain in the ‘Waiting’ status initially. To complete the task ? login to Domain Controller System ? Transaction STMS ? Go to Overview ? Systems. You can see the new system that will be available. Go to SAP System ? Approve. Managing Transport Routes Transport routes are defined as routes that are defined by the SAP Administrator to transmit the changes between different SAP systems. You can define two types of transport routes ? Consolidation (From DEV to QAS) – Transport layers are used Delivery (From QAS to PRD) – Transport layers not required Transport Request Transport request contains the number of changes to be implemented in the development system. It consists of the type of change, purpose, change category, target system and other details. Transport request are named in a standard format as ? <SID>K<Number> Example SID represents System ID K stands for fixed keyword/alphabet Number can be anything from a range starting with 900001 There are two request types that can be created in the SAP system ? Workbench Request ? This request type is used to contain the repository and cross-client customizing objects. Workbench requests are used to make changes in the ABAP workbench objects. Customizing Request ? This request type is used to contain objects that belong to client-specific customizing. These requests are created in the system automatically when a user customizes the setting and a target system is automatically assigned as per the transport layer. To create a Transport request, use Transaction SE01 Transport request can be created in two ways ? Automatic ? It is created automatically. Manual ? You can also create a Transport request manually. Import/Export of Objects in the Transport System Once the Transport request is completed in the source system, you have to export the request from the source system and import it to the target system. To perform the import, you have to select the import queue. Run the Transaction STMS ? Import or you can go to the Overview tab at the top ? Imports. You can see a list of systems in the current domain, description, and the number of requests available in the Import Queue and the status. Import Queue This list contains Transport requests in the directory that are ready to import to the target system. To add a request manually, you can go to Extras ? Other Requests ? Add. You should know the name of the Transport request. Transport Request Logs You can also check the logs once the transport request is completed. To check the logs, Transaction SE01 ? Goto ? Transport Logs. Following two types of logs are available in the Transport Management System ? Transport Log ? It keeps track of the transport log files which has been moved in a transport request. Action Log ? It includes the details of action logs that has been performed in a transport request. It includes exports, imports, etc. Log Record Value Following log record value exists in the Transport Management System ? 0 ? This value represents that export was successful. 4 ? This value represents that a warning was issued and the objects were transported successfully. 8 ? This represents that a warning was issued and at least one object could not be transported. 12 or higher ? This value represents an error in the transport request and it is normally not resulted because of the objects in Transport Request. This occurs probably due to the system failure. SAP NetWeaver - Managing Background Jobs Background jobs are jobs in the SAP system that run in the background without affecting the normal operations in the system. Background jobs are used to reduce the manual effort and to automate the process. They can run in the background without any user input and can be scheduled to run when the system load is low. Background jobs can be divided into three categories ? Class A (High Priority) ? This is used for urgent or critical task and must be scheduled with class A priority job. Class A job reserves one or more background work processes. Class B (Medium Priority) ? These jobs are executed after the completion of Class A high priority jobs. Class C (Low Priority ? These job runs once class A and class B jobs are completed. Transaction Code - SM36 General Data In general data, enter the following details to create a background job ? Enter the Job Name Priority/Job Class Select the Target server on which you want to execute the job. This is used for load balancing. You can define the target server on which you want to run the job. Using Spool List Recipient, enter the email id if you want to get the results in email. To define the steps for execution, go to Step tab. Enter the program name, Variant name in the field. If you have not created variant as per your requirement, then leave it blank. Click on the save button at the bottom. To pass the start condition, enter the start date, end date, frequency, etc. In case, the start condition is not specified, then the job will remain in the scheduled state and will not run. Various options can be used to define the start condition. To create a periodic job, select the box at the bottom. Once schedule is defined, click the Save button to save the job. You can define different Scheduling options ? Immediate ? To immediately run the job. Date/Time ? You can add a date and time to run the job. After Job ? You can also schedule this job after a particular job is completed. After Event ? You can also add a schedule when a specific event is triggered. At Operation Mode ? You can also add a schedule in the operation mode. Unscheduling a Background Job To un-schedule a job so that it doesn’t run in future, you have to release the job. To unschedule a job, use Transaction Code: SM37 Note ? When a job is in the Active state, it can’t be unscheduled till it’s completed. Step 1 ? Enter the job name and the user name. Step 2 ? To un-schedule a job, select Released and Ready from the status tab. Step 3 ? Enter the Job start condition and Select Execute button at the top as shown in following screenshot. The following screenshot will confirm that job is released as well as other details of the job. SAP NetWeaver - NW Business Client SAP NetWeaver Business Client (NWBC) is a user interface to access all the applications from a single platform. You don’t need to open each application and you can work with each application without opening it in SAP logon or the Internet Explorer. You can access NWBC in two ways ? NWBC for HTML This can be opened using a URL and there is no need to install a client tool in this case. URL format ? http://applicationservername.com:8070/nwbc/~launch/?sapclient=800&sap-language=EN You have to enter the details in the URL to login to NWBC. The following information is required: System, Client, User, Password, and Language as shown in the following screenshot. NWBC for Desktop Application In this case, you need to install NWBC desktop tool and you have to add the URL and Application server details. SAP NWBC supports Single Sign On and hence it will be a very useful tool for business users as well as for developers to perform all the necessary action from a single platform as there is no need to login at multiple places to access different applications. Note ? Users can use SAP NetWeaver Business Client and SAP Front End GUI client to access SAP systems. The use of both depends on the requirement. If the user accesses only the SAP system and no web-based applications are used, SAP GUI is preferred. When the user has both SAP system and web-based application, it is recommended to use NetWeaver Business Client. Key Difference between SAP GUI and NWBC The main difference between NWBC and SAP GUI is the way you can access Web Dynpro (WD) application. Using SAP GUI, when you execute WD application, it opens in a browser whereas on NWBC it opens within the GUI just like a normal Dynpro transaction if that application is added to your role. Note that SAP NW Business Client works on a role-based access. That is, when you log in to a particular system using NWBC, you will see only those transactions in the roles assigned to you and the tabs you can see on the home page is defined as per the role assigned. NWBC Release There are 3 versions that has been released for NetWeaver Business Client: NWBC 3.0, NWBC 3.5, and NWBC 4.0 To use NetWeaver Business Client 4.0, you also should have the latest version SAP GUI installed, i.e. SAP GUI 7.4. NetWeaver Business Client navigation is divided into 4 parts as shown in the following screenshot ? Navigation Panel on the left side Navigation Tab at the top Canvas work area Quick Launch bar above the navigation tab In the Launchpad, you can perform advanced Search that doesn’t require the developers and the users to remember the full transaction code. You can simply start typing the first letter and it will provide you with suggestions. SAP NetWeaver - Service Configuration To use NetWeaver Business Client locally, you need to configure the services to your backend system. Different services need to be configured. HTTP/HTTPS Settings in the ICM You have to configure HTTP/HTTPS setting in Internet Communication Manager to enable communication between SAP system and Business Client applications. NetWeaver Business Client uses HTTP to access an ABAP server. Hence, it is important to configure at least one port and it should be active. To configure HTTP service, use Transaction SMICM To display the services configured in the back-end system, click on Goto ? Services If the HTTP or HTTPS service does not yet exist or you would like to make changes, you can create or edit a service, following the path - Service ? Create or Service ? Change. To activate/deactivate a service, select the service and click Service ? Activate. Activate Services in ICF Using Internet Communication Framework, you can communicate your SAP system using standard protocols. To be able to use NWBC for your system, you need to activate SICF service on your system using the SICF transaction which is /sap/bc/nwbc and its components under it. Step 1 ? To activate the service, call Transaction: SICF Step 2 ? Set the Hierarchy Type to SERVICE and click Execute (F8). Step 3 ? Expand the nodes under the default_host. Step 4 ? The cockpit subnode for the Business Client can be accessed by navigating down to the following service tree: default_host/sap/bc/nwbc Step 5 ? Select the relevant service node(s) and choose Service/Host ? Activate. Step 6 ? Select any service and click deactivate. You will be prompted to confirm the deactivation. Step 7 ? Go to Info tab as shown in the following screenshot, you can see the results of deactivation. Click Yes for the corresponding services to be deactivated. SAP NetWeaver - Business Client Installation NetWeaver Business Client is available for Windows operating system and ensures the smooth running of Business client. Hardware requirement includes at least 1 GB memory and the requirement of memory depends on the number of open session tabs and the number of windows. SAP recommends minimum screen size of 1024*768 and VGA monitoring. All the hardware requirements are same as of SAP GUI front-end installation. To install NWBC desktop application, you need the setup of the tool. Step 1 ? Run the setup file by double-clicking on it and the installation wizard will open. The wizard will help you configure SAP Product installation ? Next. Step 2 ? In the next window as shown in the following screenshot, you have to make the product selection. Select SAP NetWeaver Business Client and click the Next button. You should have enough memory on your disk drive to meet the Memory Space Requirements for the installation. Step 3 ? Select the Next button and the installation process will start. During the installation process, you will be informed about the installation progress. Step 4 ? To complete the setup, click the Finish button as shown in the following screenshot. NWBC Transaction & Navigation There are different system transaction codes provided, that you can use to access and manage NetWeaver Business Client in the ABAP system. Use transaction code, Transaction: NWBC When you run this transaction in ABAP system, this will start the “launch URL” in the browser and a separate browser instance will start. In case, your HTTP service is not configured/activated, you will get the following message when you run Transaction: NWBC To resolve this, you have to run Transaction SMICM. Click Go To ? Services. Select HTTP service, Service ? Activate. When you run NWBC transaction in ABAP system, it shows a list of all cockpits on the system and the list of associated roles. The first icon or the link with the leading slash will open NWBC for HTML. The second icon or the link without the leading slash will open NWBC desktop tool. Note ? Using transaction NWBC, class CL_GUI_HTML_VIEWER always starts the URL in the browser – Microsoft Internet Explorer, even if another browser is defined as your default browser on the system. This is due to the reason that class contains additional logic to inject authentication information from the running SAP GUI session into the Internet Explorer (IE) instance when started. Hence, the client will be open in Internet Explorer browser with the same user name. SAP Applications based on NW SAP NetWeaver is known as open technology software component that provides you a platform to run critical business applications and integration between people, processes, and information. It allows the composition, provisioning, and management of SAP and non-SAP applications across a heterogeneous software environment. The following table defines the main use cases of SAP NetWeaver and its key area ? S.NO Use Case & Description 1 Data Warehousing SAP BW 2 Building Integration scenarios SAP Process Integration PI 3 Mobilizing Business Processes SAP NetWeaver Mobile 4 Building Composite Applications SAP Composition Environment 5 Integration with SAP Enterprise Portal SAP Enterprise Portal 6 Application Development ABAP ABAP Development on NetWeaver Application Server ABAP SAP NetWeaver BW SAP Business Intelligence (BI) means analyzing and reporting of data from different heterogeneous data sources. SAP Business Warehouse (BW) integrates data from different sources, transforms and consolidates the data, performs data cleansing, and storing of data as well. It also includes data modeling, administration, and staging area. The data in SAP BW is managed with the help of a centralized tool known as SAP BI Administration Workbench. The BI platform provides infrastructure, which include OLAP Processor, Metadata Repository, Process designer, and other functions. The Business Explorer (BEx) is a reporting and analysis tool that supports query, analysis and reporting functions in BI. Using BEx, you can analyze the historical and current data to different degree of analysis. SAP BW is known as an open and standard tool, which allows you to extract the data from different systems and then sends it to the BI system. It also evaluates the data with different reporting tools and you can distribute this to other systems. The following diagram shows an open, broad and standard-based Architecture of Business Intelligence. SAP Process Integration SAP Process Integration (PI) is a part of the SAP NetWeaver platform. It is called SAP NetWeaver Exchange Infrastructure (XI) in NetWeaver 7.0 ehp2 and older versions. SAP NetWeaver Process Integration is a part of the NetWeaver software component and is used for exchange of information in the company’s internal system or with external parties. SAP PI/XI enables you to set up cross-system communication and integration, and allows you to connect SAP and non-SAP systems based on different programming languages like Java and SAP ABAP. It provides an open source environment that is necessary in complex system landscape for the integration of systems and for communication. SAP Process Integration is a middleware to allow seamless integration between SAP and non-SAP application in a company or with systems outside the company. SAP PI architecture consists of multiple components which are used at design time, configuration time, and runtime. In SAP PI, the sender system is known as the source and the receiver is called the target system and the architecture is known as Hub and Spoke structure. The Spoke is used to connect with external systems and the Hub is used to exchange messages. A SAP PI system is divided into the following components ? Integration Server Integration Builder System Landscape Directory SLD Configuration and Monitoring SAP NetWeaver Mobile SAP NetWeaver mobile is a solution which is used to develop mobile solution for SAP Business Suite. You can use different tools to deploy and operate mobile applications for occasionally and always connected mobile devices. There are two possible scenarios for SAP NetWeaver mobile ? Occasionally Connected In occasionally connected SAP NetWeaver mobile scenario, a mobile device contains a mobile client and a web server, database layer, and business logic. In this scenario, use can work offline and doesn’t wait for network connectivity to middleware to work on any critical tasks assigned to them. NetWeaver mobile device also contains tool for data synchronization and data replication to make data available to the back-end system. Always Connected In always connected scenario, to manage business operations, the mobile device is always connected to the middleware. Mobile applications are available on the central server and there is no mobile client. The users have to connect to the server to access these applications. Applications are developed and deployed on the central server and it is rendered differently as per different mobile devices. In both the mobile scenarios, SAP NetWeaver Mobile acts as the middleware for enterprise mobility. Following functions are provided using this middleware ? Messaging and Network Monitoring Device Management Data distribution Enterprise Identity Security Application Development ABAP ABAP stands for Advanced Business Application Programming, a 4GL (4th generation) language. Currently it is positioned, along with Java, as the main language for SAP application server programming. Web Dynpro is a standard SAP UI technology that allows you to develop web applications using graphical tools and development environment integrated with ABAP workbench. The use of graphical tools reduces the implementation effort and you can better reuse and maintain the components in ABAP workbench. To access Web Dynpro runtime environment and graphical tools in ABAP workbench, you can use Transaction code - SE80. Both these solutions are developed on NetWeaver platform and provides application and web-developed environment to users. Web Dynpro is an ABAP environment for web development and is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) concept of UI programming. It is available for both Java and ABAP as per the platform, and supports similar functions. Web Dynpro has the following features ? Separation of display and business logic Easy change in the layout with the use of graphical tools No platform dependency of interfaces Following are the key concepts as part of Web Dynpro architecture ? Metadata Web Dynpro provides you with an environment for the development of web-based applications and you can use graphical tools to define Web Dynpro application in the form of metadata in application development. You can also define your own events; however, event handling should be defined in a separate code and that has to be executed when an event is triggered. The user interface in Web Dynpro application consists of small elements defined by using Web Dynpro tools. You can also change or enhance the user interface by changing these elements at run time or integrate the elements again. Graphical Tools There are a wide range of graphical Web Dynpro tools that you can use to generate webbased applications. You don’t need to create source code for this. Following are the key features of graphical tools in Web Dynpro application ? Define properties of user interface elements Data flow User interface layout For all these properties, you can use graphical tools without creating a source code. Business and Application Logic Web Dynpro allows you to run your application on the front-end, and the back-end system can be accessed using the service locally or via a remote connection. Your user interface is maintained in Dynpro application and a persistent logic runs in the back-end system. You can connect Web Dynpro application to the back-end system using an adaptive RFC service or by calling a web service. MVC Programming Model Web Dynpro applications are based on MVC model ? Model ? This allows access to back-end data in a Web Dynpro application. View ? This is used to ensure the representation of data in a web browser. Controller ? This is used to control the communication between Model and View where it takes the input from the users and gets the processes data from the model and displays the data in the browser. SAP NetWeaver - Portal SAP NetWeaver portal is one of the key components in NetWeaver architecture and provides a single point of access to the organization’s applications. Customers, partners, and the employees of the organization can use Enterprise Portal as a single point of access to the organization’s services and information needed for performing their day-to-day task. SAP NetWeaver Portal allows the following types of authentication to the users ? Username and password SAP Logon Tickets X.509 certificate using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Client Certificate Assertion Ticket SAP NetWeaver portal provides two types of usage ? Application Portal EPC This is applicable when full enterprise portal capabilities are not required. It is also known as EP Core. It consists of Portal and Universal Worklist (UWL). Portal provides single access point to SAP and non-SAP information sources, organization applications, database and services. The user can access the portal from mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, as well as from desktop and laptops. Portal allows the users - employees, customers, partners, and suppliers - to manage role-based access in accessing the information, specific to their daily work tasks. Universal Worklist allows the business users to manage, operate, and delegate daily work items. Work items can be generated using automated business processes Using UWL, it collects work items from multiple provider systems in one list for one-stop access. NetWeaver Enterprise Portal Enterprise Portal includes Knowledge management and Collaboration capabilities and is based on EP Core. Portal Navigation When you run NetWeaver Portal, it provides all key objects of your organization with a role-based secure access to their day-to-day work-related information. All the stakeholders - customers, partners, suppliers and vendors - can access SAP applications, third party applications, desktop applications, documents, databases, and other services. NetWeaver portal framework contains all the required components and functions on each page that the user can navigate. Top Level Navigation ? To manage the user and system administration tasks and development activities. Detailed Navigation ? System landscape, all added system and Landscape Management, and Service Configuration. Knowledge Management and Universal Work List navigation. Search Field with Tool Area ? To perform a Search in Portal content and advance search options. Dynamic Navigation Portal Favorites ?

System Landscape, as shown in the following screenshot. Step 3 ? Next, go to Portal Content. Right-click Portal Content and select New System as shown in the following screenshot. Step 4 ? Select JDBC System, and click Next. Step 5 ? Enter the System Name and System ID properties as New System ? Next ? Finish. Enterprise Portal Roles and Group All the user and roles tasks of Enterprise portal can be performed using User Management Engine (UME). UME is integrated to SAP NetWeaver Application Server. In UME, you define UME actions to apply authorizations. UME actions are JAVA permissions to define the user roles and they can be further assigned to Portal roles. User Management Engine performs user authorization to ensure that users have the correct UME actions assigned to them before providing access to iViews and functions in Enterprise Portal. For each portal role, there is UME action defined in the User Management Engine. Following table lists down all the key portal roles and corresponding UME actions. Key Portal Roles UME Actions Delegated User Administrator UME.Manage_Users UME.Manage_Role_Assignment Every User Core Role UME.Manage_My_Profile Standard User Role UME.Manage_My_Profile Super Administrator UME.AclSuperUser UME.Manage_All System Admin UME.System_Admin User Administrator UME.Manage_All Following UME actions are defined only for Enterprise Portal roles ? UME.AclSuperUser UME.Manage_Role_Assignments UME.Remote_Producer_Read_Access UME.Remote_Producer_Write_Access Comparison between UME & Portal Roles In NetWeaver portal, both UME roles and Portal roles can be managed by Portal administrators. UME roles contain JAVA actions; however, portal role contains access to iViews, folders, and systems. Following table lists the key differences between UME and Portal Roles ? Portal Roles UME Roles Used to manage the portal content - iViews, work sets, folders, etc. UME actions are sets of Java permissions. This is used to define how the content is grouped together and how it is displayed in the portal. By assigning a portal role, you define which content a user sees in the portal. This is used to define the authorizations that a user has to run applications on the J2EE engine. When you assign a portal role to a user or group, they get end-user permission on the role. This provides access to applications on the J2EE engine. They are created in the Role editor of Portal Content Studio. They are created using Identity Management. Create a Role and Add iViews to Role Step 1 ? To create a role, navigate to Content Administration ? Portal Content. Step 2 ? Right-click a folder of your choice and select New ? Role. Step 3 ? To start with, create a role and name it OBNRole. Step 4 ? To start with, create a role and name it OBNRole. Step 5 ? Go to User Administration tab ? Roles as shown in the following screenshot. Step 6 ? Find the OBNRole created in the previous step and add to it the Administrator user/other user using the Assigned role tab as shown in the following screenshot. SAP NetWeaver - Knowledge Management SAP NetWeaver Knowledge Management (KM) component organizes unstructured information from different data sources into a structured format and makes it accessible to all users. The information from various data sources exist in the form of notepad documents, PPTs, and HTML formats. Information from different sources can be integrated using different functions. Key Features of SAP Enterprise Knowledge Management Following are the key features of SAP Knowledge Management capability ?

Process Integration Options SAP Process Integration (SAP PI) is a part of the SAP NetWeaver platform. It is called SAP NetWeaver Exchange Infrastructure XI in NetWeaver 7.0 ehp2 and older versions. SAP NetWeaver Process Integration is a part of the NetWeaver software component and is used for exchange of information in the organization’s internal system or with external parties. SAP PI/XI enables you to set up a cross-system communication and integration, and allows you to connect SAP and non-SAP systems based on different programming languages, like Java and SAP ABAP. It provides an open source environment that is necessary in complex system landscape for the integration of systems and for communication. SAP Process Integration is a middleware to allow seamless integration between SAP and non-SAP application in an organization or with systems outside the organization. Why Do We Need SAP PI? In an organization, SAP ERP doesn’t contain a single system but consists of a number of integrated systems, like SAP CRM, FICO, EWM, etc. SAP PI provides a platform as a single point of integration for all systems without touching the complex legacy system for all data and information exchange. Following are the key capabilities provided by SAP Process Integration ? Connectivity Using SAP PI, you can connect different applications and systems that have different technical ways of communication. SAP PI provides you with a variety of adapters that allow you to connect applications based on different protocols like HTTPS or Remote Function Call (RFC). Routing Routing defines the rules for flow of messages between the different systems at runtime. Mapping SAP PI is used to connect different applications or systems in a distributed environment that can be set up between different organization. Hence, there is a possibility that the structure of data exchange between two components differs from each other. SAP NetWeaver PI Installation Options When you run a scenario in SAP PI, the communication and processing capabilities depend on runtime engines that are installed with the installation of SAP PI. You can install one or more runtime engines on a host system. SAP PI provides the following two installation options ? Type 1 - Dual Usage Type This installation is based on ABAP and Java and provides tools for designing and configuring integration content as well as the following runtime engines ? Integration Engine Business Process Engine Advanced Adapter Engine Type 2 - Advanced Adapter Engine Extended (AEX) This installation is based on Java and provides tools for designing and configuring integration content and contains AEX as runtime engine. SAP NetWeaver PI Architecture SAP PI architecture consists of multiple components which are used at design time, configuration time, and runtime. In SAP PI, the sender system is known as the source and the receiver is called the target system. The architecture is known as Hub and Spoke structure. The Spoke is used to connect with external systems, while the Hub is used to exchange messages. A SAP PI system is divided into the following components ? Integration Server Integration Builder System Landscape Directory (SLD) Configuration and Monitoring SAP NetWeaver - Gateway SAP NetWeaver Gateway is used to set up a connection between SAP business suite, target clients, platforms, and framework. It offers development and generation tools to create OData services with different client development tools. SAP NetWeaver gateway provides an easier way for the consumption on business logic and the content for SAP back-end system on web applications. It also reduces the complexity to access SAP data and provides easy interfaces to decrease the development time. SAP NetWeaver Gateway: Capabilities and Key Benefits SAP NetWeaver Gateway is a technology that provides a simple way to connect devices, environments, and platforms to SAP software based on market standards. Non-disruptive, any SAP business suite. Easy to develop simple APIs and does not require any tool knowledge. Based on REST, ATOM/OData. It allows connectivity to SAP applications using any programming language or model, without the need for SAP knowledge, by leveraging REST services and OData/ATOM protocols. It provides plug-ins for well-known IDEs such as Eclipse, Visual Studio 2010 and XCode. Gateway Installation / Deployment Options There are two different deployment options available to deploy SAP NetWeaver ? Central Hub Deployment of SAP NetWeaver Gateway In this option, Gateway server functionalities are used on one dedicated server, the hub system. As against the first option, service deployment takes place on the Hub system. This option is used if either no development must be performed on the back-end system or in case of releases prior to 7.40. or if it is not allowed to deploy the Add-On IW_BEP in the back-end. In this case, the developer is limited to the interfaces that are accessible via RFC in the back-end. Development takes place in Gateway hub system and Business suite back-end systems are not touched. IW_BEP or SAP_GWFND runs in Gateway hub system and nothing is touched in SAP Business suite. Advantages Advantages Disadvantages There is no direct access to metadata (DDIC) and business data. Therefore, the reuse of data is limited. GENIL objects cannot be used remotely. In this configuration, access is limited to remote enabled interfaces, like RFC modules, BAPIs, etc. Embedded Deployment In Embedded deployment architecture, development takes place in SAP Business suite back-end system. The Gateway system is also installed in the same system. Services are registered as well as published in the SAP Business Suite back-end system. IW_BEP or SAP_GWFND runs in the same system in which SAP Business suite is installed. Advantages ? It requires less run time as one remote call is reduced. Disadvantages ? The system should not be used as a hub for additional back-end systems. In case of multiple SAP Business Suite systems, the Gateway has to be configured multiple times. This configuration is recommended only for sandbox purposes. SAP NetWeaver - Security In a distributed environment, you use Internet for managing business data and security is one of the critical requirements in any system. There should not be any unauthorized access and user errors, also configuration access should not result in any loss of information. SAP NetWeaver security includes the following points ? Technical System Landscape/Architecture (previously covered) User Administration and Authenticatio Network and Transport Layer Security User Administration There are various user management tools that you can use in SAP NetWeaver. These tools are inbuilt to SAP system and can be called from transactions. Using these tools, you can manage the application platform for Java and ABAP. Managing Users in ABAP Engine Step 1 ? Manage users in the SAP system using T-Code: SU01. You can use this to manage users in the ABAP system. Step 2 ? Enter the username you want to create and click the create icon as shown in the following screenshot. Step 3 ? You will be directed to the next tab - the Address tab. Here, you need to enter the details like the first name, the last name, phone number, email id, etc. You will further be directed to the next tab - Logon Data as shown in the following screenshot. Step 4 ? Enter the user type under Logon data tab. We have five different user types. Following are the different user types ? Dialog user ? This user is used for interactive system access from GUI. System user ? This user is used for background processing, communication within a system. Communication user ? This user is used for external RFC calls Service user ? This user is created for a larger and anonymous group of users. Reference user ? It is not possible to log on to the system with this user type. User type for general, non-person related users that allows the assignment of additional authorizations. Step 5 ? Type the first Login Password ? New Password ? Repeat Password. You will be directed to the next tab – Roles. Step 6 ? Assign the roles to the user. You will further be directed to the next tab – Profiles. Step 7 ? Assign the Profiles to the users. Step 8 ? Click the Save icon to receive confirmation. Lock/Unlock a User In SAP system, an administrator can also lock or unlock a user as per the requirement. This can be performed for a specific time period or permanently. A user can be locked/unlocked in the following two ways ? Manually/Forcefully Automatically (After number of failed login attempts) Manually or Forcefully You can lock a user forcefully/automatically using these transaction codes ? Transaction code — SU01 for single user Transaction code — SU10 for multiple users Step 1 ? Execute transaction code — SU01 Step 2 ? Select the user you want to lock/unlock and click the icon as shown in the following screenshot. SAP NetWeaver - PFCG Roles You can use this transaction (Transaction – PFCG) to manage roles in the ABAP system and to provide user authorization. You can create new roles, copy existing roles, define single and composite roles, etc. Step 1 ? In the following screenshot, enter the role name and click the Single/Composite role. Step 2 ? To copy an existing role, click the Copy Role button. Select the role from the list of the existing roles. You can select Single/Composite Role. Step 3 ? To change a role, select the role from the list and click the Change button as shown in the following screenshot. Step 4 ? When you go to the User tab, you will see the list of users who have applied for this role. You can see their user id, user name, from and to date. Step 5 ? You can also perform a user comparison master record or you can add a direct user to this role. SAP NetWeaver - Authentication Methods To authenticate the user, the ABAP front-end server uses the authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanisms provided by SAP NetWeaver. Following mechanisms can be used for authentication SPNEGO/KERBEROS SPNEGO is used when a client application wants to authenticate to a remote server, but neither end is sure what authentication protocols the other supports. The pseudomechanism uses a protocol to determine what common Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) mechanisms are available, selects one and then dispatches all further security operations to it. This can help organizations deploy new security mechanisms in a phased manner. SAP Logon Tickets SAP Logon Tickets represent user credentials in SAP systems. When enabled, the users can access multiple SAP applications and services through SAP GUI and web browsers without further username and password inputs. SAP Logon Tickets can also be a vehicle for enabling SSO across SAP boundaries. In some cases, logon tickets can be used to authenticate into third party applications such as Microsoft-based web applications. X.509 Certificates An X.509 certificate contains information about the identity to which a certificate is issued as well as the identity that issued it. Many of the certificates that people refer to as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates are in fact X.509 certificates. SAP NetWeaver - Communication Security Secure Network Communications (SNC) integrates SAP NetWeaver Single Sign-On or an external security product with SAP systems. With SNC, you strengthen security by using additional security functions provided by a security product that is not directly available with SAP systems. SNC protects the data communication paths between the various client and the server components of the SAP system that use the SAP protocols, Remote Function Call (RFC) or Dynamic Information and Action Gateway (DIAG). There are well-known cryptographic algorithms that have been implemented by the various security products, and with SNC, you can apply these algorithms to your data for increased protection. Important Features SNC secures the data communication paths between the various SAP system client and server components. There are well-known cryptographic algorithms that have been implemented by security products supported, and with SNC you can apply these algorithms to your data for increased protection. With SNC, you receive application-level, end-to-end security. All communication that takes place between two SNC-protected components is secured. Additional security features like Smart Cards can be used that SAP does not directly provide. You can change the security product at any time without affecting the SAP business applications. Levels of Protection You can apply three levels of security protection. They are ? Authentication only Integrity protection Privacy protection Authentication Only When using authentication only, the system verifies the identity of the communication partners. This is the minimum protection level offered by SNC. Integrity Protection When using integrity protection, the system detects any changes or manipulation of the data, which may have occurred between the two ends of a communication. Privacy Protection When using privacy protection, the system encrypts the messages being transferred to make eavesdropping useless. Privacy protection also includes integrity protection of the data. This is the maximum level of protection provided by SNC. Previous Page Print Next Page   Advertisements Write for us FAQ's Helping Contact © Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved. go
