<h1>Mobile Security - Introduction</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we will deal with mobile security concepts mostly from the practical point of view. Take a look at the following graph, it illustrates the ever-growing number of mobile phone users across the world, which brings out the importance of mobile security.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/global_users.jpg" alt="Global Users" />
<p>The estimated number of mobile devices is around 5.8 billion, which is thought to have grown exponentially within five years and is supposed to reach nearly 12 billion within four years. Hence, it will be an average of two mobile devices per person on the planet. This makes us fully dependent on mobile devices with our sensitive data being transported all over. As a result, mobile security is one of the most important concepts to take in consideration.</p>
<p>Mobile Security as a concept deals with the protection of our mobile devices from possible attacks by other mobile devices, or the wireless environment that the device is connected to.</p>
<p>Following are the major threats regarding mobile security &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Loss of mobile device. This is a common issue that can put at risk not only you but even your contacts by possible phishing.</p></li>
<li><p>Application hacking or breaching. This is the second most important issue. Many of us have downloaded and installed phone applications. Some of them request extra access or privileges such as access to your location, contact, browsing history for marketing purposes, but on the other hand, the site provides access to other contacts too. Other factors of concern are Trojans, viruses, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Smartphone theft is a common problem for owners of highly coveted smartphones  such as iPhone or Android devices. The danger of corporate data, such as account credentials and access to email falling into the hands of a tech thief is a threat.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Mobile Security - Attack Vectors</h1>
<p>By definition, an <b>Attack Vector</b> is a method or technique that a hacker uses to gain access to another computing device or network in order to inject a “bad code” often called <b>payload</b>. This vector helps hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Many of these attack vectors take advantage of the human element as it is the weakest point of this system. Following is the schematic representation of the attack vectors process which can be many at the same time used by a hacker.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/hacker.jpg" alt="Hacker" />
<p>Some of the mobile attack vectors are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Malware</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Virus and Rootkit</p></li>
<li><p>Application modification</p></li>
<li><p>OS modification</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data Exfiltration</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Data leaves the organization</p></li>
<li><p>Print screen</p></li>
<li><p>Copy to USB and backup loss</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data Tampering</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Modification by another application</p></li>
<li><p>Undetected tamper attempts</p></li>
<li><p>Jail-broken devices</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data Loss</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Device loss</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized device access</p></li>
<li><p>Application vulnerabilities</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences of Attack Vectors</h2>
<p>Attack vectors is the hacking process as explained and it is successful, following is the impact on your mobile devices.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Losing your data</b> &minus; If your mobile device has been hacked, or a virus introduced, then all your stored data is lost and taken by the attacker.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Bad use of your mobile resources</b> &minus; Which means that your network or mobile device can go in overload so you are unable to access your genuine services. In worse scenarios, to be used by the hacker to attach another machine or network.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reputation loss</b> &minus; In case your Facebook account or business email account is hacked, the hacker can send fake messages to your friends, business partners and other contacts. This might damage your reputation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Identity theft</b> &minus; There can be a case of identity theft such as photo, name, address, credit card, etc. and the same can be used for a crime.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Anatomy of a Mobile Attack</h2>
<p>Following is a schematic representation of the anatomy of a mobile attack. It starts with the infection phase which includes attack vectors.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/mobile_attack.jpg" alt="Mobile Attack" />
<h3>Infecting the device</h3>
<p>Infecting the device with mobile spyware is performed differently for Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p><b>Android</b> &minus; Users are tricked to download an app from the market or from a third-party application generally by using social engineering attack. Remote infection can also be performed through a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where an active adversary intercepts the user’s mobile communications to inject the malware.</p>
<p><b>iOS</b> &minus; iOS infection requires physical access to the mobile. Infecting the device can also be through exploiting a zero-day such as the JailbreakME exploit.</p>
<h3>Installing a backdoor</h3>
<p>To install a backdoor requires administrator privileges by rooting Android devices and jailbreaking Apple devices. Despite device manufacturers placing rooting/jailbreaking detection mechanisms, mobile spyware easily bypasses them &minus;</p>
<p><b>Android</b> &minus; Rooting detection mechanisms do not apply to intentional rooting.</p>
<p><b>iOS</b> &minus; The jailbreaking “community” is vociferous and motivated.</p>
<h3>Bypassing encryption mechanisms and exfiltrating information</h3>
<p>Spyware sends mobile content such as encrypted emails and messages to the attacker servers in plain text. The spyware does not directly attack the secure container. It grabs the data at the point where the user pulls up data from the secure container in order to read it. At that stage, when the content is decrypted for the user’s usage, the spyware takes controls of the content and sends it on.</p>
<h3>How Can a Hacker Profit from a Successfully Compromised Mobile?</h3>
<p>In most cases most of us think what can we possibly lose in case our mobile is hacked. The answer is simple - we will lose our privacy. Our device will become a surveillance system for the hacker to observer us. Other activities of profit for the hacker is to take our sensitive data, make payments, carry out illegal activities like <b>DDoS attacks</b>. Following is a schematic representation.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/ddos_attack.jpg" alt="DDoS Attack" />
<h2>OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks</h2>
<p>When talking about mobile security, we base the vulnerability types on OWASP which is a not-for-profit charitable organization in the United States, established on April 21. OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world.</p>
<p>For mobile devices, OWASP has <b>10 vulnerability classifications</b>.</p>
<h3>M1-Improper Platform Usage</h3>
<p>This category covers the misuse of a platform feature or the failure to use platform security controls. It might include Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of TouchID, the Keychain, or some other security control that is part of the mobile operating system. There are several ways that mobile apps can experience this risk.</p>
<h3>M2-Insecure Data</h3>
<p>This new category is a combination of M2 and M4 from Mobile Top Ten 2014. This covers insecure data storage and unintended data leakage.</p>
<h3>M3-Insecure Communication</h3>
<p>This covers poor handshaking, incorrect SSL versions, weak negotiation, clear text communication of sensitive assets, etc.</p>
<h3>M4-Insecure Authentication</h3>
<p>This category captures the notions of authenticating the end user or bad session management. This includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Failing to identify the user at all when that should be required</li>
<li>Failure to maintain the user's identity when it is required</li>
<li>Weaknesses in session management</li>
</ul>
<h3>M5-Insuficient Cryptography</h3>
<p>The code applies cryptography to a sensitive information asset. However, the cryptography is insufficient in some way. Note that anything and everything related to TLS or SSL goes in M3. Also, if the app fails to use cryptography at all when it should, that probably belongs in M2. This category is for issues where cryptography was attempted, but it wasn't done correctly.</p>
<h3>M6-Insecure Authorization</h3>
<p>This is a category to capture any failures in authorization (e.g., authorization decisions in the client side, forced browsing, etc.) It is distinct from authentication issues (e.g., device enrolment, user identification, etc.)</p>
<p>If the app does not authenticate the users at all in a situation where it should (e.g., granting anonymous access to some resource or service when authenticated and authorized access is required), then that is an authentication failure not an authorization failure.</p>
<h3>M7-Client Code Quality</h3>
<p>This was the "Security Decisions Via Untrusted Inputs", one of our lesser-used categories. This would be the catch-all for code-level implementation problems in the mobile client. That's distinct from the server-side coding mistakes. This would capture things like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and various other code-level mistakes where the solution is to rewrite some code that's running on the mobile device.</p>
<h3>M8-Code Tampering</h3>
<p>This category covers binary patching, local resource modification, method hooking, method swizzling, and dynamic memory modification.</p>
<p>Once the application is delivered to the mobile device, the code and data resources are resident there. An attacker can either directly modify the code, change the contents of memory dynamically, change or replace the system APIs that the application uses, or modify the application's data and resources. This can provide the attacker a direct method of subverting the intended use of the software for personal or monetary gain.</p>
<h3>M9-Reverse Engineering</h3>
<p>This category includes analysis of the final core binary to determine its source code, libraries, algorithms, and other assets. Software such as IDA Pro, Hopper, otool, and other binary inspection tools give the attacker insight into the inner workings of the application. This may be used to exploit other nascent vulnerabilities in the application, as well as revealing information about back-end servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, and intellectual property.</p>
<h3>M10-Extraneous Functionality</h3>
<p>Often, developers include hidden backdoor functionality or other internal development security controls that are not intended to be released into a production environment. For example, a developer may accidentally include a password as a comment in a hybrid app. Another example includes disabling of 2-factor authentication during testing.</p>
<h1>App Stores &amp; Security Issues</h1>
<p>An authenticated developer of a company creates mobile applications for mobile users. In order to allow the mobile users to conveniently browse and install these mobile apps, platform vendors like Google and Apple have created centralized market places, for example, PlayStore (Google) and AppStore (Apple). Yet there are security concerns.</p>
<p>Usually mobile applications developed by developers are submitted to these market places without screening or vetting, making them available to thousands of mobile users. If you are downloading the application from an official app store, then you can trust the application as the hosting store has vetted it. However, if you are downloading the application from a third-party app store, then there is a possibility of downloading malware along with the application because third-party app stores do not vet the apps.</p>
<p>The attacker downloads a legitimate game and repackages it with malware and uploads the mobile apps to a third-party application store from where the end users download this malicious gaming application, believing it to be genuine. As a result, the malware gathers and sends user credentials such as call logs/photo/videos/sensitive docs to the attacker without the user's knowledge.</p>
<p>Using the information gathered, the attacker can exploit the device and launch any other attack. Attackers can also socially engineer users to download and run apps outside the official apps stores. Malicious apps can damage other applications and data, sending your sensitive data to attackers.</p>
<h2>App Sandboxing Issues</h2>
<p>Sandbox helps the mobile users by limiting the resources that an application uses in the mobile device. However, many malicious applications can overpass this allowing the malware to use all the device processing capabilities and user data.</p>
<h3>Secure Sandbox</h3>
<p>It is an environment where each application runs its allocated resources and data so the applications are secure and cannot access other application resources and data.</p>
<h3>Vulnerable Sandbox</h3>
<p>It is an environment where a malicious application is installed and it exploits the sandbox by allowing itself to access all data and resources.</p>
<h1>Mobile Security - Mobile Spam</h1>
<p>Take a look at the following screenshot. You might have received a similar SMS which seemed to be genuine. In fact, after a bit of analysis, we realize it is not genuine. It is an example of <b>SMS phishing</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/sms_phishing.jpg" alt="SMS Phishing" />
<p>The links in the SMS may install malware on the user’s device or direct them to a malicious website, or direct them to call a number set up to trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details. This technique is used a lot in cybercrimes, as it is far easier to trick someone into clicking a malicious link in the e-mail than trying to break through a mobile’s defenses. However, some phishing SMS are poorly written and clearly appear to be fake.</p>
<h2>Why SMS Phishing is Effective?</h2>
<p>SMS Phishing is successful because it plays with the fear and anxiety of the users. Irrational SMS instills fear in the mind of the users. Most of the scenarios have to do with the fear of losing money, like someone has purchased something using your credit cards.</p>
<p>Other instances include, the fear when an SMS accuses you of doing something illegal that you haven’t done. Or an SMS regarding the possibility of harming your family members.  of your family, etc.</p>
<h2>SMS Phishing Attack Examples</h2>
<p>Now let us see a few examples to understand the cases where SMS Phishing mostly happens.</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Generally, scammers use email to SMS to spoof their real identity. If you google it, you may find many legitimate resources. You just google search: email to SMS providers.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>The other classical scam is financial fraud which will ask you for PIN, username, password, credit card details, etc.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/classical_scam.jpg" alt="Classical Scam" />
<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>Spelling and bad grammar. Cyber criminals generally make grammar and spelling mistakes because often they use a dictionary to translate in a specific language. If you notice mistakes in an SMS, it might be a scam.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/scam.jpg" alt="Scam" />
<h3>Example 4</h3>
<p>SMS phishing attempt to create a false sense of urgency.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/false_sense.jpg" alt="False Sense" />
<h3>Example 5</h3>
<p>Cybercriminals often use threats that your security has been compromised. The above example proves it well. In the following case, the subject says you have won a gift.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/cybercriminals.jpg" alt="Cybercriminals" />
<h3>Example 6</h3>
<p>In this case, an SMS asks you to reply so that they can verify that your number is valid. This can increase the number of SMS spams in your number.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/sms_spams.jpg" alt="SMS Spams" />
<h3>Example 7</h3>
<p>Spoofing popular websites or companies. Scam artists use the name of big organizations that appear to be connected to legitimate websites but actually it takes you to phony scam sites or legitimate-looking pop-up windows.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/spoofing.jpg" alt="Spoofing" />
<h2>Prevention and Solutions</h2>
<p>In order to protect ourselves from SMS phishing some rules have to be kept in mind.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Financial companies never ask for personal or financial information, like username, password, PIN, or credit or debit card numbers via text message.</p></li>
<li><p>Smishing scams attempt to create a false sense of urgency by requesting an immediate response. Keep calm and analyze the SMS.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t open links in unsolicited text messages.</p></li> 
<li><p>Don’t call a telephone number listed in an unsolicited text message. You should contact any bank, government, agency, or company identified in the text message using the information listed in your records or in official webpages.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t respond to smishing messages, even to ask the sender to stop contacting you.</p></li>
<li><p>Use caution when providing your mobile number or other information in response to pop-up advertisements and “free trial” offers.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify the identity of the sender and take the time to ask yourself why the sender is asking for your information.</p></li>
<li><p>Be cautious of text messages from unknown senders, as well as unusual text messages from senders you do know, and keep your security software and applications up to date.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Pairing Mobile Devices on Open Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Connections</h2>
<p>Bluetooth is a similar radio-wave technology, but it is mainly designed to communicate over short distances, less than about 10m or 30ft. Typically, you might use it to download photos from a digital camera to a PC, to hook up a wireless mouse to a laptop, to link a hands-free headset to your cellphone so you can talk and drive safely at the same time, and so on.</p>
<p>To obtain this connection, devices exchange each other’s PIN, but in general as a technology it is not secure. It is a good practice to repair the devices after a period of time.</p>
<h3>What a hacker can do with a paired device?</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Play sounds of incoming call</li>
<li>Activate alarms</li>
<li>Make calls</li>
<li>Press keys</li>
<li>Read contacts</li>
<li>Read SMS</li>
<li>Turn off the phone or the network</li>
<li>Change the date and time</li>
<li>Change the network operator</li>
<li>Delete applications</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Security measures for Bluetooth devices</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Enable Bluetooth functionality only when necessary.</li>
<li>Enable Bluetooth discovery only when necessary.</li>
<li>Keep paired devices close together and monitor what's happening on the devices.</li>
<li>Pair devices using a secure passkey.</li>
<li>Never enter passkeys or PINs when unexpectedly prompted to do so.</li>
<li>Regularly update and patch Bluetooth-enabled devices.</li>
<li>Remove paired devices immediately after use.</li> 
</ul>
<h1>Mobile Security - Android OS</h1>
<p>As many of us know, software is developed by Google for mobile devices with processing capabilities for smartphones and tablets. Its kernel is based on Linux. Its installed applications run in a sandbox. However, many producers have released its antiviruses for such OS, like Kasperky, MCAfee, and AVG Technologies. Even though antivirus application runs under sandbox, it has a limit to scan the environment.</p>
<p>Some feature of android OS are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Dalvik virtual machine optimized for mobile device</li>
<li>SQLite database for structured data</li>

<li><p>Content providers permit applications to access and use data from third party applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Activity manager controls the life cycle of an application.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource manager allocates resources to an application.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification manager helps to shows notifications of applications.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>The third layer is libraries,</b> which is the most important part. It utilizes the function of the application, for example, to store date in a database. It is SQLite that utilizes this function.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The fourth layer is the Linux Kernel.</b> It holds all the drivers of the hardware components, such as camera, wireless, storage, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Android Device Administration API</h2>
<p>The Device Administration API introduced in Android 2.2 provides device administration features at the system level. These APIs allow developers to create security-aware applications that are useful in enterprise settings, in which IT professionals require rich control over employee devices.</p>
<p>The device admin applications are written using the Device Administration API. These device admin applications enforce the desired policies when the user installs these applications on his or her device. The built-in applications can leverage the new APIs to improve the exchange support.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of applications that might use the Device Administration API &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Email clients</li>
<li>Security applications that do remote wipe</li>
<li>Device management services and application</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples used in this tutorial are based on the Device Administration API sample, which is included in the SDK samples (available through the Android SDK Manager) and located on your system as</p>
<p><b>&lt;sdk_root&gt;/ApiDemos/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/apis/app/ DeviceAdminSample.java.</b></p>
<h3>Sample Application</h3>
<p>This sample application offers a demo of device admin features. It presents the users with a user interface that lets them enable the device admin application.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/sample_application.jpg" alt="Sample Application" />
<p>Once the users have enabled the application, they can use the buttons in the user interface to do the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Set password quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify requirements for the user's password, such as minimum length, the minimum number of numeric characters it must contain, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the password. If the password does not conform to the specified policies, the system returns an error.</p></li>
<li><p>Set how many failed password attempts can occur before the device is wiped (that is, restored to factory settings).</p></li>
<li><p>Set how long from now the password will expire.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the password history length (length refers to the number of old passwords stored in the history). This prevents the users from reusing one of the last passwords they previously used.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify that the storage area should be encrypted, if the device supports it.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the maximum amount of inactive time that can elapse before the device locks.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the device lock immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Wipe device data (that is, restore factory settings).</p></li>
<li><p>Disable the camera.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Mobile Security - Android Rooting</h1>

<h1>Mobile Security - Apple iOS</h1>
<p>iOS is Apple mobile's operating system established for its iPhones. It maintains and sustains other Apple devices such as iPod Touch, iPad, and Apple TV. Using the Mac OS X, the iOS operating system is fabricated. </p>
<p>The user interface is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. This has many other options and features using which daily work becomes easy and this can be updated on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch using Wi-Fi and other wireless networks.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/ios.jpg" alt="iOS" />
<h2>Jailbreaking iOS</h2>
<p>Jailbreaking is taking control of the iOS operating system that is used on Apple devices, in simple words the symmetry of Rooting in Android devices. It removes the device from the dependencies on exclusive Apple source applications and allows the user to use third-party apps unavailable at the official app store.</p>
<p>It is accomplished by installing a modified set of kernel patches that allows you to run third-party applications not signed by the OS vendor. It is used to add more functionality to standard Apple gadgets. It can also provide root access to the operating system and permits download of third-party applications, themes, extensions, etc. This removes sandbox restrictions, which enables malicious apps to access restricted mobile resources and information.</p>
<p>Jailbreaking, like rooting, also has some security risks to your device &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Voids your phone's warranty</li>
<li>Poor performance</li>
<li>Bricking the device</li>
<li>Malware infection</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Jailbreaking</h2>
<p>When the device starts booting, it loads Apple's own iOS, and to install apps from third parties, the device must then be broken and have the kernel patched each time it is turned on. There are three types of jailbreaking methods used.</p>
<h3>iBoot Exploit</h3>
<p>An iBoot jailbreak allows the file system and iboot level access. This type of exploit can be semi-tethered if the device has a new boot-rom. This is mostly used to reduce low-level iOS controls. This exploit method takes the help of the hole in the iBoot to delink the code signing appliance and then the customer can download the required applications. Using this method, the users configure the mobile to accept custom firmware and probably jailbreak more.</p>
<h3>Userland Exploit</h3>
<p>A userland jailbreak allows user-level access but doesn't allow iboot-level access. This type of exploit cannot be tethered as it cannot have recovery mode loops. These can be patched by Apple. The userland exploits use a loophole in the system application to gain control of that application. The exploit can only give control to the filesystem. This type of exploit can access non-vital code in the application and is user friendly and platform independent.</p>
<h3>Bootrom Exploit</h3>
<p>A bootrom jailbreak can break all the low-level authentications such as providing filesystem, iBoot, and NOR access (custom boot logos). This process finds a hole in the application to discard the signature checks. It can't be corrected by Apple. A bootrom jailbreak allows user-level access and iBoot-level access. These cannot be patched by Apple.</p>
<h2>Jailbreaking Techniques</h2>
<p>There are two types of Jailbreaking techniques.</p>
<h3>Untethered Jailbreaking</h3>
<p>Untethered jailbreak is a technique of rebooting the mobile device without connecting it to the system every time it is booted. If the battery of the device is spoiled, after changing it boots as usual. Tools for this are PwnageTool, Greenpois0n, Sn0wbreeze, and Limera1n.</p>
<h3>Tethered Jailbreaking</h3>
<p>If the device starts backing up on its own, it will no longer have a patched kernel, and it may get stuck in a partially started state. In order for it to start completely and with a patched kernel, it essentially must be "re-jailbroken" with a computer (using the "boot tethered" feature of a jailbreaking tool) each time it is turned on.</p>
<h2>App Platform for Jailbroken Devices: Cydia</h2>
<p>Cydia is a jailbreaking device which can be downloaded from <a href="https://cydia.saurik.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://cydia.saurik.com/</a>. It helps iOS users to install other third party applications. Cydia has different extensions, themes, features, and customizations.</p>
<p>It is a graphical front-end to Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) with the dpkg package management system, which means that the packages available in Cydia are provided by a decentralized system of repositories (also called sources) that list these packages.</p>

<h1>Mobile Security - BlackBerry OS</h1>
<p>BlackBerry OS is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by Research in Motion for its BlackBerry line of smartphones and handheld devices. It includes a Java based thirdparty application framework that implements J2ME Mobile Information Device Profile v2 (MIDP2) and Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC), as well as a number of RIM specific APIs.</p>
<p>Some of the features of BlackBerry include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Native support for corporate email</li>
<li>BlackBerry enterprise server</li>
<li>BlackBerry messenger</li>
<li>BlackBerry internet service</li>
<li>BlackBerry email client</li>
</ul>
<h2>BlackBerry Enterprise Solution Architecture</h2>
<p>Blackberry Enterprise Solution allows the mobile users to wirelessly access their organization emails and other business-critical applications, safely and securely. BlackBerry Enterprise Solution Architecture is comprised of six vital elements. They are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>BlackBerry Enterprise Server</li>
<li>Blackberry Mobile Data System</li>
<li>BlackBerry Smartphones</li>
<li>BlackBerry Connect Software</li>
<li>Blackberry Alliance Program</li>
<li>BlackBerry Solution Services</li>
</ul>
<p>The enterprise server, together with enterprise messaging and collaboration systems, provides email access to the mobile users, enterprise instant messaging, and personal information management tools. Poorly configured firewalls increase the risk of attacks. The Web, Database, and Application Server contain vulnerabilities. If the attacker detects those vulnerabilities, then he or she can easily carry out an attack and take control over the entire server.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/blackberry_architecture.jpg" alt="BlackBerry Architecture" />
<h2>BlackBerry Attack Vectors</h2>
<p>BlackBerry faces many attacks since there are many new tools and methods available for finding potential vulnerabilities present on BlackBerry devices. Attack vectors attract users to download malicious software on their mobiles. Finding website vulnerabilities using tools, etc. are the few techniques used by an attacker for carrying out attacks on BlackBerry devices. Apart from these techniques, there are many more attack vectors that allow attackers to launch attacks on BlackBerrys that include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Malicious Code Signing</li>
<li>Memory and Processes Manipulations</li>
<li>Email Exploits</li>
<li>TCP/IP Connections Vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Blackberry Malwares</li>
<li>JAD File Exploits</li>
<li>Short Message Service (SMS) Exploits</li>
<li>PIM Data Attacks</li>
<li>Telephony Attacks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Malicious Code Signing</h3>
<p>A BlackBerry application must be signed by RIM to get full access to the operating system APIs. If a required signature is missing or the application is altered after signing, the JVM will either refuse/restrict the API access to the application or will fail at run-time with an error message. Attackers can obtain code-signing keys anonymously using prepaid credit cards and false details, sign a malicious application, and publish it on the BlackBerry app world. Attackers can also compromise a developer's system to steal code-signing keys and passwords to decrypt the encrypted keys.</p>
<h3>JAD File Exploits and Memory/ Processes Manipulations</h3>
<p>JAD files include the attributes of a Java application, such as app description and vendor details and size, and provides the URL where the application can be downloaded. It is used as a standard way to provide Over The Air (OTA) installation of Java applications on J2ME mobile devices. Attackers can use specially crafted <b>.jad</b> files with spoofed information and trick users into installing malicious apps.</p>
<h3>Short Message Service (SMS) Exploits</h3>
<p>Regular PC users are more likely to be targeted by premium rate <b>dialers</b> applications that connect a user's modem to a premium rate telephone number, which results in more service provider bills than expected. The same mechanism is enforced in BlackBerry but doesn't use premium rate SMSes.</p>
<h3>Email Exploits</h3>
<p>In BlackBerry mobile, all emails are sent, received, and read through the <b>net.rim.blackberry.api.mail</b> package and this package can be used only on signed applications. BlackBerry attachment service supports only files with extensions such as .doc, .pdf, .txt, .wpd,.xls, and .ppt, but it can send any kind of file via email. An attachment with file <b>type .cod</b> is not supported by BlackBerry.</p>
<h3>PIM Data Attacks</h3>
<p>Personal Information Management (PIM) data in the PIM database of a BlackBerry device includes address books, calendars, tasks, and memo pads information. Attackers can create malicious signed applications that read all the PIM data and send it to an attacker using different transport mechanisms. The malicious applications can also delete or modify the PIM data.</p>
<h3>TCP/IP Connections Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>If the device firewall is off, signed apps can open TCP connections without the user being prompted. Malicious apps installed on the device can create a reverse connection with the attacker enabling him or her to utilize infected device as a TCP proxy and gaining access to organization's internal resources. Attackers can also exploit the reverse TCP connection for backdoors and perform various malicious information gathering attacks.</p>
<h1>Mobile Security - BlackBerry Devices</h1>
<p>Following are some of the practical guidelines to secure BlackBerry devices. The list is based on the best practices and these are not universal rules.</p>
<ul class="list">

<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Detect capability leaks in Android devices by using the tool Woodpecker.</p>
<h2>iPhone Pen Testing</h2>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Try to Jailbreak the iPhone using tools such as Redsn0w, Absinthe, Sn0wbreeze, and PwnageTool.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try to unlock the iPhone. To unlock the iPhone use tools such as iPhoneSimFree which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.iphonesimfree.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.iphonesimfree.com</a> and anySIM.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/iphone_pen_testing.jpg" alt="iPhone Pen Testing" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus;  Use SmartCover to bypass passcode for which you need to follow these steps: Hold the power button of an iOS operating device until the power off message appears. Close the smart cover until the screen shuts and opens the smart cover after few seconds. Press the cancel button to bypass the password code security.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Hack iPhone using Metasploit, which is incorporated in Kali distribution. Use the Metasploit tool to exploit the vulnerabilities in the iPhone, based on the vulnerabilities that you find.</p>
<p>As Metasploit is a Rapit7 company product further details can be found at <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2007/10/21/cracking-the-iphone-part-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2007/10/21/cracking-the-iphone-part-3</a>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/metasploit.jpg" alt="Metasploit" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Check for the access point with the same name and encryption type.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus;  Do a man-in-the-middle/SSL stripping attack by intercepting wireless parameters of iOS device on a Wi-Fi network. Send malicious packets on the Wi-Fi network using the Cain &amp; Abel tool or even Wireshark.</p>
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Check whether the malformed data can be sent to the device. Use social engineering techniques such as sending emails or SMS to trick the user into opening links that contain malicious web pages.</p>
<h2>Windows Phone Pen Testing</h2>
<p>Following are the steps for Windows phone pen testing.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Try to turn off the phone by sending an SMS. Send a SMS to the phone, which turns off the mobile and reboots it again.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try to jailbreak the Windows phone. Use the WindowBreak program to jailbreak/unlock the Windows phone. You can get more details about this tool in the link <a href="http://windowsphonehacker.com/articles/the_windowbreak_project-12-23-11" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://windowsphonehacker.com/articles/the_windowbreak_project-12-23-11</a></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mobile_security/images/windows_pen_testing.jpg" alt="Windows Pen Testing" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Check for on-device encryption. Check whether the data on the phone can be accessed without a password or PIN.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Check for a vulnerability in Windows Phone Internet Explorer. Check whether the flaw in CSS function in Internet Explorer allows the attackers to gain full access over the phone through remote code execution.</p>
<h2>BlackBerry Pen Testing</h2>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Firstly, you do a blackjacking on the BlackBerry. Use BBProxy tool to hijack the BlackBerry connection which can be found on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Check for flaws in the application code signing process. Obtain code-signing keys using prepaid credit cards and false details, sign a malicious application, and publish it on the BlackBerry app world.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Perform an email exploit. Send an email or message to trick a user to download a malicious <b>.cod</b> application file on the BlackBerry device.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Perform a DoS attack. Try sending malformed Server Routing Protocol (SRP) packets from the BlackBerry network to the router to cause a DoS attack. Some tools were mentioned in the previous chapters.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Check for vulnerabilities in the BlackBerry Browser. Send maliciously crafted web links and trick the users to open links containing malicious web pages on the BlackBerry device.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Search for password protected files. Use tools like Elcomsoft Phone Password Breaker that can recover password protected files and backups from BlackBerry devices.</p>
