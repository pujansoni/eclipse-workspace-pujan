<h2>History of Facebook</h2>
<p>Facebook was founded by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg on February 4, 2004. In May 2007, Facebook opened up its developer platform to allow third-party developers to build applications and widgets that, once approved, could be distributed through the Facebook community. In May 2008, Facebook engineers announced <b>Facebook connect,</b> a cross-site initiative that allows users to publish on third-party sites in their Facebook newsfeed. The site was redesigned in late 2008, intended to streamline the website and make it easier to see what friends were doing.</p>
<h2>What is Facebook Marketing?</h2>
<p>Facebook is undoubtedly the most popular social media platform available with many advantages associated with it. It is primarily a social networking site, however it can be used as a handy tool for promoting and advertising a business. We can use Facebook to promote a brand, market a company, or create awareness about a service or a product.</p>
<p>Success with this form of marketing requires more than a fan page and a few friends. When used effectively, Facebook marketing can provide a business with exciting benefits and results. Facebook marketing can enable businessmen to greatly improve their brand awareness and reach out to a wider audience.</p>
<h2>How to Create a Fan Page?</h2>
<p>A Facebook fan page is an amazing way to promote your business, build awareness for a cause, and gather support for your brand. If you would like to create a fan page, follow these easy steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Log in to your Facebook account.</li>
<li>Click on the settings on the top right-hand corner of your page.</li>
<li>Click on create page.</li>
<li>Click on the type of page you would like to create.</li>

<li>Complete the 'about' section and click 'save info'.</li>
<li>Now decide whether you want to enable ads or skip (it will be payable if you enable).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Facebook Profiles</h2>
<p>Facebook Profiles are for people and they are generally meant for personal use only. A Facebook profile is an account that is allocated against an individual, who can use it to network with friends and colleagues, and share information with them. It is designed to be a unique profile on the Facebook network for that one individual, and it is not meant to be used to represent a company, an organization, or a fictional character.</p>
<h2>Facebook Places</h2>
<p>Facebook Places enable people to provide real-time update of where they are and what they are doing when they are on the move. It also enables its users to take advantage of unexpected coincidences such as discovering that they are at some concert as their friends. Users can check in when they arrive at a location, and see whether their friends are nearby. The best part about Facebook places is that it will more or less maintain itself once it has been created. Facebook users do have the ability to 'like' the Facebook places as well, so encourage visitors to press the 'like' button after they check in.</p>
<h2>Facebook Groups</h2>
<p>Facebook Groups are the places for small group communication where users can share their common interests and express their opinion. Groups allow people to come together around a common cause. Groups are for discussing issues and share related content. When we create a group, we can decide whether to make it publicly available for anyone to join, require administrator approval for members to join, or keep it private and by invitation only. Groups range widely &minus; from light-hearted themes to organizing activities to serious topics such as politics and world events.</p>
<h2>Facebook Community</h2>
<p>A Facebook Community is about an organization, a celebrity, or a topic. Community pages are meant for general topics and all kinds of unofficial but interesting things. These pages let us stay connected with others who share similar interests and experiences.</p>
<h2>Grow Your Business with Facebook</h2>
<p>Facebook is fast becoming a powerhouse of marketing activity due to the sheer number of engaging users on the site and the simplicity of connecting with them directly.</p>
<p>Facebook can provide your business with a branding outpost on the web where customers, employees, and even the media can find information about your company, products, and services. Facebook connects you and your staff directly to your customers and fans.</p>
<p>Facebook can generate new leads for your business by drawing users’ attention towards what you are offering. Facebook helps in sharing links, images, and posts on a customizable page to project a better sense of your business. Facebook runs tactics like contests, sweepstakes, etc., that can increase fans and brand awareness of your business.</p>
<img src="images/grow_business_with_facebook.jpg" alt="Grow Business With Facebook" />
<h2>Latest Facebook Trends</h2>
<p>The nature of social media marketing is ever-changing, so it is important to constantly stay updated with what the current market trends are. The latest Facebook trends that a business should be aware of are &minus; using the cover photo for marketing, different types of Facebook posts, more pictures, etc. Facebook looks completely different from how it was a year ago, so it should not be surprising that marketing on the social network has also changed a great deal.</p>
<h2>What are Adverts?</h2>
<p>Adverts on Facebook are unique. They are shown to specific groups of highly engaged people. If your adverts have a great creative content and are well targeted, they get more likes, comments, and shares. When we boost our page posts or expand the audience for the adverts, more people will see them when they visit Facebook. Facebook ads allow us to promote our business, get more fans to our business page, and drive more leads for our sales team. Facebook ads allow us to advertise a website or content that we manage on Facebook (like a group, page, or event)</p>
<p>To create an ad, go to &minus; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/advertising">Facebook</a> And click "create an ad".</p>
<h2>How to Create a Campaign?</h2>
<p>With targeted ads, stories, and wall posts, a successful campaign can be a powerful tool in our advertising arsenal. When running a Facebook campaign, we can draw on several Facebook components such as wall posts, Facebook ads, sponsored marketing, unique page tabs, etc. We can break down reports by campaign and also easily start/stop all ad sets within that campaign.</p>
<p>Campaigns correspond to each of our advertising objectives, like building brand awareness or driving web traffic. They are designed to help optimize and measure our results for each objective across multiple ad sites and ads. Each campaign can feature multiple ad sets, each of which has its own budget and schedule. We can also organize each ad set to represent a particular audience segment, for example, we can have an ad set for people who live near our store. This will help us control the amount we spend on each audience, decide when they will see our ads, and measure their response. Within each ad set, we can have multiple ads, each of which can feature a different set of images, links, videos, or text.</p>

<h1>SMM - Pinterest Marketing</h1>

<h2>History of Pinterest</h2>
<p><b>Ben Silbermann</b> is an American Internet entrepreneur who co-founded Pinterest. He is also the CEO of Pinterest.</p>
<p>Silbermann says that the genesis of Pinterest really came from his love of collecting as a kid. “Collecting tells a lot about who you are,” he said, and when they looked at the web, “there wasn’t a place to share that side of who you were.”</p>
<h2>Pinterest – Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul class="list">

<li><p>Users can also personalize their experience with Pinterest by pinning items, creating boards, and interacting with other members. By doing so, the users "pin feed" displays unique, personalized results.</p></li>

<li><p>They also have the option of sending a pin to other Pinterest users and email accounts through the "Send" button.</p></li>
</ul>
