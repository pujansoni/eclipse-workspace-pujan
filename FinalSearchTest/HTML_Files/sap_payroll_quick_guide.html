<h1>SAP Payroll - Introduction</h1>
<p>SAP Payroll is one of the key modules in SAP Human Capital Management. This is used to calculate the remuneration for each employee with respect to the work performed by them. SAP Payroll not only consists of remuneration part, but also the other benefits that the organization has to provide for the employee welfare according to different company laws in any country. These commonly include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Labor Law</li>
<li>Benefits Law</li>
<li>Contribution Law</li>
<li>Tax Law</li>
<li>Information Law</li>
<li>Reporting Law</li>
<li>Statistics Law</li>
</ul>
<p>A <b>SAP Payroll System</b> manages the gross and net pay, which also includes the payments and deductions calculated while processing payroll for an employee. The system calculates the payment and all deductions while processing remuneration using different wage types.</p>
<p>Once the payroll processing is done, the system carries out different subsequent activities.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; You can generate various lists related to remuneration and deductions performed in the system.</p>
<h2>Integration with Other Modules for Payroll Processing</h2>
<p>SAP Payroll module is easily integrated with &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Personnel Administration</li>
<li>Time Management</li>
<li>Incentive and Wages</li>
<li>Finance and Accounting</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Personnel Administration</b> is used to get the master data and other payroll related information. By using <b>Time Management</b>, you can get the time related data to calculate the remuneration and for payroll run.</p>
<p><b>Incentive and Wages</b> data is used to calculate the incentive wages component in the payroll. Wage type defines the daily payroll for each employee and incentive defines the other extra benefits that should be paid to an employee.</p>
<p>Expense Payable for payroll is posted to cost center using integration with SAP Finance and Accounting module. You can assign the cost to cost centers in <b>Finance and Accounting</b> module. Here you can also manage the expense for payroll processing of the third party vendors.</p>
<h2>Basics – Payroll</h2>
<p>Payroll is based on the <b>payroll driver</b> that varies with each country and region. The payroll driver considers the administrative and legal regulations of the country while defining the payroll. While running a payroll, the payroll driver refers to its corresponding payroll schema, which contains a number of different functions. Each function consists of import data function from internal tables and payroll related files.</p>
<p><b>The steps in Payroll processing</b> &minus;</p>
<p>A payroll system gets the payroll related data from the system. In case of <b>off-cycle payroll</b>, the system deletes the internal table and imports the last payroll result. The gross wage, shift schedule, and compensation along with the valuation bases are calculated in the system and the master data relevant to this payroll is added in the calculation.</p>
<p>Next is to calculate the partial period factors, salary elements, and to calculate the gross results. Finally, in the last process system calculates the net remuneration and performs the accounting in case there is any change in the master data from a previously processed payroll.</p>
<p>Once this payroll run is completed, the results are transferred to Finance Accounting and evaluation. Then the posting is done for the corresponding cost centers.</p>
<h3>Payroll Driver</h3>
<p>Payroll driver is used to run the payroll and their structure is based on that particular country’s laws, as each country has a specific payroll driver.</p>
<p><b>Following are a couple of drivers with their technical names</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>RPCALCx0</b> &minus; Here, <b>x</b> represents the country specific code, like ‘D’ for Germany and F for France, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>HxxCALC0</b> &minus; Here, <b>xx</b> represents the ISO code for country, like ID for Indonesia.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Payroll Schema</h3>
<p>This represents the calculation rules used by the payroll driver. In SAP Payroll system, you have country-specific schemas <b>X000</b> where <b>X</b> represents the country indicator.</p>
<p>The Schema structure consists of the following components &minus;</p>
<p><b>Initialization</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Includes updating the database</li>
<li>Importing the Infotypes</li>
<li>Calculating gross pay</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Processing of time data from time management</li>
<li>Off cycle payroll run</li>
<li>Payroll accounting of last processed payroll</li>
<li>Calculating time related data and calculating gross amount for each employee</li>
<li>Performing factors</li>
<li>Calculating Net pay</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Calculating the net remuneration</li>
<li>Performing the bank transfers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Payroll – Background Operation</h2>
<p>It is also possible to automate the payroll run partially or fully and schedule it to run in the background. SAP recommends a few tasks to be run in the background for better performance.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Payroll can be run in the night and you can check the results the next morning.</p>
<h3>How to Schedule Payroll in Background?</h3>
<p>Go to System &rarr; Service &rarr; Jobs &rarr; Define Job or SM36</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/payroll_background_schedule.jpg" alt="Payroll Background Schedule" />
<p>You can define the job here to let the payroll run to process in the background. These background jobs are processed using a <b>Computing Center Management System (CCMS)</b> in the SAP system. The CCMS can be used to perform the following functions.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The configuration and monitoring of this background processing system.</li>
<li>Managing and scheduling background jobs in the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Schedule a Background Job?</h3>
<p>To schedule a background job, enter the Job Name. Enter the job class that defines the priority of the job.</p>
<p>You can define three types of priorities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Class A - High</li>
<li>Class B - Medium</li>
<li>Class C - Low</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also define the system for load balancing in the target filed. If you want the system to select the server automatically for load balancing purpose, you can leave this option blank.</p>
<p>If you want the spool request generated from this job to be sent to someone using email, you can mention the same in the Spool list recipient.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/payroll_background_schedule_job.jpg" alt="Payroll Background Schedule Job" />
<p>To define a start condition, click on the Start condition tab, there are various options that you can use to define the <b>Start condition</b>. If you want to create a periodic job, check the box at the bottom left side of the screen as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/start_condition.jpg" alt="Start Condition" />
<p>Define the steps of the job by clicking the <b>Step</b> tab. You can specify the <b>ABAP Program</b>, external command or any external program to be used for each step. The next step is to save the job to submit to background processing system.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You have to release a job to make it run. No job even those scheduled for immediate processing, can run without first being released.</p>
<h1>SAP Payroll - Off-Cycle Activities</h1>
<p>Off-Cycle activities are carried out to process payroll for an employee on any day unlike payroll run that is a periodic activity and schedule to run at specific time interval.</p>
<p>In order to perform Off-Cycle activities, you should define an Off-Cycle activity section in customizing for payroll. Off-Cycle consists of the following areas &minus;</p>
<h2>Off-Cycle Workbench</h2>
<p>It provides a uniform user interface for all the Off-Cycle activities. You can perform the following functions in an Off-Cycle workbench &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To make a bonus payment to an employee on a special occasion like a marriage gift, new born baby, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>To perform an immediate correction run.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Consider where employee master data got modified.</p></li>
<li><p>To pay an absence like a leave in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>To process the payments that are added to Payroll Results Adjustment under Infotype 0221.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a case where the payment was made but not received by an employee. To perform a replacement, you can use Off-Cycle workbench.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to reverse a payroll result.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Payroll History</h2>
<p>This is one of the key components that allows you to check the previous payroll run results for an employee within an <b>Off-Cycle workbench</b>.</p>
<p>In the Off-Cycle workbench, go to History tab to display an extract from the payroll which contains all the necessary information of an employee payroll. It also shows details of all the payments that are replaced with a check along with any payroll’s which are reversed are also mentioned here.</p>
<p>If you want to check any further details on an employee payroll, you can check the remuneration statement for the employee for a specific payroll period.</p>
<p>You can also check the following details about the payment made in the History tab under workbench &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>For reverse payment you can check the reason for reversal and person who has carried out reversal payment.</p></li>
<li><p>To check the replace payment details, you can find which payments are replaced and by which check number.</p></li>
<li><p>Details of check number, bank name, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that to view the remuneration statement of a payroll &rarr; select the result and choose &rarr; Remuneration Statement.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/remuneration_statement.jpg" alt="Remuneration Statement" />
<h2>Off-Cycle Subsequent Processing</h2>
<p>This is used to further process the Off-Cycle payroll results, a payment reversal or repayment, etc. When a bonus payment is made using a workbench, a replaced or reverse payroll, remuneration statement should be generated and results from payroll run should be posted to Accounting.</p>
<p>All the details related to Off-Cycle payroll, reverse payment or repayment is stored in table <b>T52OCG</b> and is available in the report <b>H99LT52OCG</b> and this report is available in Off-Cycle menu.</p>
<h3>Report for Batch Subsequent Processing</h3>
<p>Subsequent processing is performed by running one or more batch reports and to ensure that subsequent processing is performed in the correct sequence. You should schedule the report for a Batch Subsequent Processing in the international standard system as regular background jobs. With scheduling report that subsequent processing is conducted regularly and on time.</p>
<h3>Process Model</h3>
<p>Process model is used to define a subsequent program and order in which they run. When you select a report for Batch Subsequent Processing, you also have to define the process model report that should be used.</p>
<p>Off–Cycle subsequent processing, it is possible to schedule the batch report in background job with process model or you can also call it in a workbench menu and run it from there.</p>
<p>According to the function executed in an Off-Cycle workbench, different activities are performed.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Consider replacing a payment.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:30%">Function</th>
<th style="text-align:center; width:50%">Activities</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Replacing a Payment</td>
<td><p>Runs Preliminary Program Data Medium Exchange</p>
<p>Indicates each payment replacement with a key composed of program run date and the indicator feature CYYYP.</p>
<p>Enters the details in the indicator table for off-cycle batch processing</p>
<p>Runs the batch report for subsequent processing of check replacement as a background job at the time that you have scheduled for the regular processing of the report</p>
<p>Reads indicator table</p>
<p>Runs the process model that you have specified in the report variant</p>
<p>Prints new checks</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h1>SAP Payroll - Infotypes</h1>
<p>To maintain a master data in SAP system, there are different Infotypes defined in SAP system for Personnel Administration and payroll.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;width:30%">Infotype</th>

<h1>SAP Payroll - Pay Scale Grouping</h1>
<p>Pay scale grouping for allowances is performed to add similar type of employees in a group and similar characteristics are applied on each group. This is used to determine: compensation structure as per grouping, payroll processing procedure, and the value of compensation for an employee.</p>
<p>While defining the payroll processing, grouping is the first step that is performed. Wage type can’t be defined till you define the pay scale grouping for allowances.</p>
<p>Pay scale grouping for allowances is defined based on few parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Pay scale area</li>
<li>Pay scale type</li>
<li>Pay scale group</li>
<li>Pay scale level</li>
</ul>
<h2>Employee Subgrouping for Collective Agreement Processing</h2>
<p>As an example, consider a company with offices in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. Now the employee location where he is located affects the compensation to a certain level. In this case, it is possible to assign the different cities to pay scale area and hence pay scale area becomes a key pay parameter to create pay scale grouping for allowances. In a similar way you can define other pay scale parameters depends on various factors.</p>
<p>In SAP Easy access menu &rarr; SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Personnel Administration &rarr; Payroll data &rarr; Basic Pay &rarr; Define EE Subgroup Grouping for PCR and <b>Coll.Agrmt.Prov</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/employee_subgroup.jpg" alt="Employee Subgroup" />
<p>It will show you the list of EE group, the EE group name and different fields associated with it. If you want to change it, this can be done here.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/ee_group_list.jpg" alt="EE Group List" />
<p>Pay Scale Grouping for Allowances is not define in any of the Infotypes. You can’t put an employee directly to a pay scale grouping for allowances. When you define five different pay parameters, an employee is directly assigned to a pay scale grouping for allowances.</p>
<p>By entering an Employee Group and Employee Subgroup in Organizational Assignment Infotype (0001) and pay scale area, pay scale type, pay scale group, pay scale level in the Basic Pay Infotype (0008), it adds the employee to a pay scale grouping for allowances automatically. So, the pay scale grouping is defined as an assignment of the pay parameters.</p>
<p>Go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Payroll &rarr; Payroll: India &rarr; Assign Pay scale grouping for allowances.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/assign_pay_scale_grouping.jpg" alt="Assign Pay Scale Grouping" />
<p>In the next window that comes up, you can see the associated pay parameters to pay scale grouping.</p>

<li>PS Area</li>
<li>PS Type</li>
<li>PS Group</li>
<li>PS Level</li>

<h1>SAP Payroll - Indirect Evaluation</h1>
<p>Indirect Evaluation is used to calculate payroll for some specific wage types that are defaulted under the Basic Pay Infotype (0008) or Infotype 0014 or 001 (recurring payment/deductions or Additional payments).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; While using indirect evaluation, it is also possible to calculate <b>INVAL</b> as numbers instead of using value as amount considering the wage type configured correctly.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; You can configure INVAL for an employee to be eligible for 10 liters of petrol each month. This represents INVAL as number.</p>
<h2>Variants for Indirect Evaluation</h2>
<p>There are quite a few types of variants for indirect evaluation, which are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Variant A</b> &minus; This is used to calculate the wage type value as a fixed amount.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Variant B</b> &minus; This is used to calculate the amount as percentage of the base wage type added to a fixed amount. In this, multiple amounts with same or different percentage of the base wage type, can be calculated for an INVAL wage type. In this case, the amount that will be Indirectly Evaluated will be the sum of all such calculated amounts added to a fixed amount.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Wage type M230, consider the following different INVAL B amounts.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
10% of MB10
30% of M220
Fixed amount of Rs.1000
So in this scenario, wage type M230 will have INVAL amount as sum of a, b and c.
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Variant C</b> &minus; This is used to calculate the amount as a percentage of a base wage type subject to a maximum limit. More than one such amount, with same or different percentage of the base wage type, can be calculated for an INVAL wage type. In this case, the amount that will be Indirectly Evaluated will be the sum of all such calculated amounts, subject to a maximum limit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Wage type M230, consider the following different INVAL C amounts.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
15% of MB10
20% of M220
Limit of Rs.4000
In this scenario, INVAL amount for the wage type M230 will be the sum of a, and b 
subject to a maximum of c.
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Variant D</b> &minus; This is used to calculate the amount as one or any combination of the following INVAL Module variants based on Basic salary slabs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is used to calculate the fixed amount and the percentage of the basic slab. This is done by first calculating the percentage of a base wage type added to a fixed amount. And then secondly, the percentage of a base wage type which is subject to a maximum limit.</p>

<h3>Secondary Wage type or Technical Wage type</h3>
<p>The secondary wage types are predefined wage types in the SAP system and starts with a ‘<b>/</b>’. These wage types are created during the payroll run.</p>
<p>These wage types are system generated and can’t be maintained online.</p>
<p>For example &minus; <b>/559 Bank Transfer</b></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/bank_transfer.jpg" alt="Bank Transfer" />
<h3>Wage Type Elements</h3>
<p>The key elements of a wage type include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Amount AMT</li>
<li>Rate RTE</li>
<li>Number NUM</li>
</ul>
<p>As per the processing type, each element can have one, two or all element values.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; The basic pay can have a Rate and a Number, however a bonus pay can only have an amount.</p>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>The payment includes all the payments given to an employee according to the employment contract and any voluntary payment paid. A payment combines the employee gross remuneration.</p>
<p>This gross remuneration is defined as the calculation of social insurance and tax payments and also for the calculation of net remuneration.</p>
<h3>Payment Structure</h3>
<p>The payment is defined in terms of the following components in the SAP Payroll system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Basic Pay</b> &minus; This component consists of the fixed wage and other salary elements and is paid to the employee for each payroll period. The details are entered in the Basic Pay <b>(0008) Infotype</b>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Recurring Payments and Deductions</b> &minus; Recurring payments and deductions include components like overtime, leave or other components. This information is maintained in Recurring Payment and deduction <b>Infotype (0014)</b>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Additional Payments</b> &minus; There are many components in the payment section, which are not paid in each payroll period. This information is added to Additional Payments <b>Infotype (0015)</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Time Management in Payroll</h2>
<p>Time management is one of the key components in Payroll that is used to calculate the gross salary of the employees. Monetary benefits are determined by work schedule and planned working hours.</p>
<p>The time management integration with payroll is used to determine wage types like bonuses for overtime, night/odd hour work allowance, work on holiday, etc.</p>
<p>You can also use <b>Time Data Recording</b> and <b>Administration Component Integration</b> with Time Management component to find out time data information for employees and further to determine the time wage types.</p>
<p>When you use this time evaluation component <b>Integration</b> with <b>Time Management</b> component, this is used to find time wage types determined by Time Evaluation.</p>
<h2>Night Shift Compensation/Shift Change Compensation</h2>
<p>This component is used to ensure that an employee shouldn’t get financial disadvantage, if he/she is working in odd hours or if a shift time is changed for them.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; An employee’s planned working time is changed and he is facing a financial disadvantage, he or she is paid on the basis of the original working time – like an employee gets his shift changed from a night shift with night shift bonuses to an early shift.</p>
<p>If an employee’s shift time is changed and that employee will be benefited financially, he or she is paid on the basis of the changed working time.</p>
<p>Consider an employee whose shift changes from Friday to a Sunday with Sunday bonuses. In this case, a shift change compensation will be listed under the remuneration statement. It is also possible to limit the payment of a shift change compensation for a particular category.</p>
<h2>Employee Remuneration Information</h2>
<p>This is used to process the manually calculated wages, bonus or non-standard wage types.</p>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">

<p>This component provides information on payroll with time and person related time wage types. Time wage type is used to perform the financial evaluation of work performed on a payroll.</p>
<h2>Wage Type Valuation</h2>
<p>Wage type is one of the key components in payroll processing. Based on the way they store information, they can be defined as Primary and Secondary Wage types.</p>
<p>During the payroll run, the primary wage types are provided with the values and secondary wage types are formed at the time of the payroll run. You can check the characteristics of a wage type by going to the following path &minus;</p>
<p>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Personnel Management &rarr; Personnel Administration &rarr; Info Type &rarr; Wage types &rarr; Wage type catalog &rarr; Wage type characteristics</p>

<h2>Old and New Processing of Averages</h2>
<p>With the release of <b>4.6B</b>, processing of averages has been changed. Processing of averages depends on the country and release and with countries like Argentina, Brazil and a few other, a new processing is released with version <b>4.5B</b>.</p>
<p>At one time, you can only use any of these two versions, if you are using an old version, you can continue to use the same version and there is no need to move to the new version, but the older version is not under development.</p>
<p>The technical processing of averages can be configured as shown in the following steps &minus;</p>
<p>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Payroll &rarr; Payroll India &rarr; Time wage type valuation &rarr; Averages &rarr; Bases for valuation of Averages</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/old_and_new_processing_averages.jpg" alt="Old and New Processing of Averages" />

<h2>Incentive Wages: Overview</h2>
<p>To maintain incentive wages, different accounting processes are defined in standard SAP system.</p>
<h3>Monthly Wage Calculation for Incentive Wages</h3>
<p>In this Wage Type, target time for each ticket is calculated using a piecework rate. This is used to calculate the amount for time ticket that the employee is due. This amount consists of &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Basic Monthly Pay</b> &minus; This defines the gross amount that is paid to the employees irrespective of their performance and it can be paid as a monthly sum or in terms of hourly pay as per their contract.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Dependent Variable Pay</b> &minus; This is used to define the pay scale rate that is different from a master pay scale rate for an employee. It is possible that an employee is remunerated at a high rate as compared to a master pay rate for specific activities. You have to enter a higher pay scale into the time ticket.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Performance Dependent Variable Pay</b> &minus; This is used to credit when an employee completes the work in less time than the target time. The different between target time and actual time is mentioned on time ticket.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Hourly Wage Calculation for Incentive Wages</h3>
<p>This is similar to the monthly wage calculation with the only difference that the monthly wage is specified as an hourly wage from the starting, so you don’t need to convert the monthly basic wage into an hourly wage.</p>
<h2>Incentive Wage Accounting: Tools</h2>
<p><b>Personnel calculation schemas</b> &minus;</p>
<p>There are two types of schemas valuation of time tickets for incentive wages &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>German Version DIW0</b> &minus; this contains special features that are specific to German only.</p></li>
<li><p><b>International Version XIW00</b> &minus; You can use schema XIW00 to set up your own incentive wage accounting rules as per different countries. As valuation of time tickets vary according to different countries and organizations so there are no country specific accounting schemas in it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Partial Period Remuneration</h2>
<p>This component is used to check the remuneration when an employee works for a lesser period of time. You can use factoring in the following cases &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>When an employee leaves, joins or remains absent for a specific period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>When there is a change in the basic pay, substitution, work reassignment or change in personal work schedule.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To find the correct remuneration for an employee, the remuneration amount is multiplied by a partial period factor which is based on different methods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Payment method</li>
<li>Deduction method</li>
<li>PWS method</li>
<li>Hybrid method</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Payroll system contains few factoring rules that are needed to determine the partial period factor. These rules can be customized to meet specific requirements in the company.</p>
<p>The following Infotypes are calculated for partial period remuneration &minus;</p>
<table  style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:50%">Actions</th>
<th style="text-align:center; width:50%">Infotype 0000</th>

<h3>Partial Period Factor</h3>
<p>This factor is used to calculate the partial remuneration. This is defined as a variable value which is calculated using different formulas as per the company and the circumstances.</p>
<p>While customizing, partial period factors are defined in a personnel calculation rules for specific situations and assigned to wage types for particular periods.</p>
<p>When you multiply the partial period factor by the fixed remuneration amount, this gives you partial period remuneration amount to be paid for a specific period.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Consider an employee who was on an unpaid leave from 3<sup>rd</sup> February to 29<sup>th</sup> March, this means that the employee has worked for 2 days in February and 2 days in March considering 20 workdays in Feb and 23 workdays in Mar.</p>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Parameter</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">February</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">March</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Planned working time (SSOLL)</td>
<td>148</td>
<td>172</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Absence(SAU)</td>
<td>132</td>
<td>156</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Individual period working time (SDIVI)</td>
<td>148</td>
<td>172</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>General period working time (SDIVP)</td>
<td>167,7</td>
<td>167,7</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now consider reduction using the following different ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Partial Period Factor</li>
<li>Basic Remuneration</li>
</ul>
<table style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Method</th>
<th style="text-align:center;width:35%">Calculation formula</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Remuneration for February</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Remuneration for March</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>PWS</b></td>
<td>a = (SSOLL-SAU**)/SDIVI</td>
<td>0,108</td>
<td>0,093</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Reduced remuneration: b&times;a</td>
<td><b>351,22</b></td>
<td><b>302,44</b></td>

<tr>
<td><b>Payment</b></td>
<td>a = (SSOLL-SAU**)/SDIVP</td>
<td>0,095</td>
<td>0,095</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Reduced remuneration: b&times;a</td>
<td><b>308,94</b></td>
<td><b>308,94</b></td>

<td>0,213</td>
<td>0,070</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Reduced remuneration: b&times;a</td>
<td><b>692,68</b></td></td>
<td><b>227,64</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now if you use the <b>payment method</b>, the employee receives the same remuneration for both the months.</p>
<p>If you use the <b>deduction method</b>, the employee is overpaid in Feb and underpaid in March.</p>
<p>If the <b>PWS method</b> is used, the employee receives more salary in Feb as compared to March, however the difference is negligible.</p>
<h2>Salary Packaging</h2>
<p>This component is used to determine an employee’s gross and net income and various components that effects the net income of an employee.</p>

<h2>Dearness Allowance</h2>
<p>This allowance is a part of the monthly remuneration paid to an employee and varies as per the location and other factors. The value of this component depends on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for that location and this index varies as per government regulation. When an employee is transferred or moved to a different location, this allowance is also changed as per the location.</p>

<h2>Housing Allowance</h2>
<p>This component is used to maintain information about an employee accommodation. This is used to calculate tax exemptions and to check perquisite applicable on a housing benefit.</p>
<p>While updating or creating a housing record using the Housing <b>(HRA / CLA / COA)</b> under <b>Infotype (0581)</b>, the system dynamically updates the <b>Basic Pay Infotype (0008)</b> with the new or changed wage type for Housing.</p>
<h3>Different Types of Accommodation Under Housing</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Rented</b> &minus; When an employee uses a Rented Accommodation, he receives a House Rent Allowance (HRA) to meet the expenses incurred by renting a residential accommodation.</p>
<p>In this case, the system calculates the tax exemption on the rented accommodation and rented amount paid by an employee.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Company Leased Accommodation (CLA)</b> &minus; When an employee uses a Company Leased Accommodation, the company leases an accommodation and provides it as a housing benefit to the employee.</p>

<p>To avail long-term benefits by an employee, there are different perquisites attached with each benefits that should be met &minus;</p>
<h3>Hard Furnishing Scheme</h3>
<p>In this, there is a fixed percentage as the perquisite value applicable on the assets that an employee can avail during a financial year.</p>
<p>This fixed value is maintained in Calculate <b>Hard Furnishing Perk Value constant (HFPRC)</b> of the table view <b>Payroll Constants (V_T511K)</b>.</p>
<h3>Soft Furnishing Scheme</h3>
<p>In this, the system calculates perquisite value for the assets that an employee avails in the current financial year and it is based on the perquisite percentage that you maintain in the Long Term Reimbursements <b>Infotype (590)</b> and subtype <b>SSFS</b>.</p>
<h3>Car Maintenance Scheme</h3>
<p>Normally, the system doesn’t contain any perquisite value with the Car Maintenance Scheme or any other similar type of scheme you create in the system.</p>
<h2>Claims</h2>
<p>In a company, an employee is eligible to claim some monetary and non-monetary benefits and these claims vary as per the pay scale grouping and many other factors. An employee needs to submit the claim based on the eligibility to get these benefits. Claims submitted can be of the following types &minus;</p>
<h3>Monetary Claims</h3>
<p>This includes the claims that are available as per the eligibility amount.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; A conveyance allowance of Rs. 1800 per month or a Medical claim of Rs. 15000 in a given assessment year.</p>
<h3>Non-Monetary Claims</h3>
<p>These claims are commonly raised by an employee for company work. They are normally placed in units like Stationary request, Calculator, Petrol, etc.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there is one more type of claim known as the <b>slab based claim</b>. A few common types of slab based claims are LTA, car maintenance allowance, etc. These type of claims has an eligibility which is normally more than a year.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Car maintenance allowance – where the validity period starts from the date of purchase of the car and in the first and second year an employee is eligible for a car maintenance allowance of Rs. 3000 and in the third year, claim eligibility is Rs. 5000 and in the fourth year, the eligibility is Rs. 7500.</p>
<p>To get into the non-monetary claims section, you should use the following Transaction Code: PC00_M40_REMP as shown in the subsequent screenshot.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/pc00_m40_remp.jpg" alt="PC00_M40_REMP" />
<p>Once you run the above transaction, the reimbursement claim screen will appear.</p>
<p>The claims can be processed via &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Regular payroll run</b> &minus; In this reimbursement type, additional payments <b>Infotype 0015</b> is updated with the information that you enter in this report and claim disbursement is made along with the regular payroll.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Off-cycle payroll run</b> &minus; In this method, One-Time Payments Off-Cycle <b>Infotype 0267</b> is updated with the information that you enter in this report and approved claims can be disbursed through an off-cycle payment process.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_payroll/images/reimbursement_for_employees.jpg" alt="Reimbursement for Employees" />
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; In this disbursement, claims are disbursed on the same day or claims submitted during the week are disbursed on any day of the week.</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>This component is used to process the employee bonus and can compute both regular and off-cycle bonus.</p>
<p>As with claims, there are two types of bonuses that can be paid &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Type 1 Additional Payments 0015</b> &minus; In this, the SAP system updates the Infotype when a regular bonus is processed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Type 2 Additional Off-Cycle Payments for Off-Cycle Bonus 0267</b> &minus; In this, 0267 Infotype is updated in the system, when an Off-Cycle bonus is computed.</p></li>
