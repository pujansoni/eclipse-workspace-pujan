<h1>Excel Power View - Overview</h1>
<p>Power View enables interactive data exploration, visualization, and presentation that encourages intuitive ad-hoc reporting. Large data sets can be analyzed on the fly using versatile visualizations in Power View. The data visualizations are dynamic, thus facilitating ease of presentation of the data with a single Power View report.</p>
<p>Power View is based on the Data Model in your workbook. Either you can start with a Data Model that is already available in Power Pivot or you can create a Data Model from Power View itself. In this tutorial, we assume that you are aware of the Data Model concepts in Power Pivot. Otherwise, we suggest you to go through the Excel Power Pivot tutorial first.</p>
<h3>Creating Power View</h3>
<p>To create a Power View, first you need to make sure that the Power View add-in is enabled in your Excel. You can then create a Power View sheet that contains Power View, which can hold several different data visualizations based on your Data Model. You will learn how to create a Power View sheet and Power View in the chapter - Creating a Power View.</p>
<h3>Understanding Power View Sheet</h3>
<p>The Power View sheet has several components such as Power View canvas, Filters area, Power View Fields list, Power View Layout areas and Power View tabs on the Ribbon. You will learn about these components in the chapter – Understanding Power View Sheet.</p>
<h2>Power View Visualizations</h2>
<p>The core of the Power View is in its various types of data visualizations that will enable you to portray the data, visualize, and explore, all in a dynamic mode. You can handle large data sets spanning several thousands of data on the fly switching from one visualization to another, drilling up and drilling down the data displaying the essence of the data.</p>
<p>The different Power View visualizations that you can have are the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Table</li>
<li>Matrix</li>
<li>Card</li>
<li>Charts 
<ul class="list">
<li>Line Chart</li>
<li>Bar Chart</li>
<li>Column Chart</li>
<li>Scatter Chart</li>
<li>Bubble Chart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Map</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn about these visualizations in different chapters in this tutorial. You will also learn about combination of visualizations on a Power View and their interactive nature.</p>
<h3>Visualization with Multiples</h3>
<p>Another domain of Power View is its facility to visualize the Chart visualizations in Multiples. You can have a grid of Charts in Power View with the same axis. You can have Horizontal Multiples or Vertical Multiples. You will learn Multiples in Power View with different types of charts in the chapter - Visualization with Multiples.</p>
<h3>Visualization with Tiles</h3>
<p>When you have large data to display at a time, browsing up and down could take time. Power View makes this task very easy for you with Tiles. Tiles are containers on a navigation strip that is based on a field in your data. Clicking on a Tile is equivalent to selecting that value of the field and your visualization is filtered accordingly. You can have data bound images such as sport images for Tiles that will give a visual cue to your navigation strip. You will learn about Tiles in the chapter – Visualization with Tiles.</p>
<h2>Advanced Features in Power View</h2>
<p>Whenever you have to create a visualization, you need to first create a Table and then switch visualization to the required one. This would make you create the Tables several times during data exploration and reporting. Even after you decide on what fields to portray in your visualizations, you have to repeatedly select all these fields every time. Power View provides you with an advanced feature to define a default field set that enable you to select all the fields with a single click on the table name in the Power View Fields list.</p>
<p>You can set table behavior, filter all the visualizations together with the VIEW tab in filters, change the sort order of a field, filter visualizations with Slicers, add data labels and add a title to the Power View. You will learn about these and more in the chapter – Advanced Features in Power View.</p>
<h3>Power View and Data Model</h3>
<p>We said Power View is based on the Data Model. You can either work on the Data Model that is already present, as is the case in all the previous chapters, or create one from the Power View sheet. You will learn about adding data tables to Data Model, creating relationships between tables and modifying Data Model from Power View sheet in the chapter – Power View and Data Model.</p>
<h3>Hierarchies in Power View</h3>
<p>If you data has nested fields you can define a hierarchy so that you can treat all the nested fields as one field. You can have a defined hierarchy in the Data Model that you can visualize from Power View or you can create a hierarchy in Power View and use it for visualization. You can drill p and drill down the hierarchy in Matrix, Bar Chart, Column Chart and Pie Chart visualizations. You can filter hierarchy in Pie Chart with Column Chart. You will learn all these in the chapter – Hierarchies in Power View.</p>
<h3>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Power View</h3>
<p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) enable you to track the progress against the set goals. You can create KPIs in the Data Model from Power View. You can then create appealing Power View visualizations that depict the KPIs and produce aesthetic reports. You can also edit the KPIs from Power View as it is possible that the KPIs might have to be modified as the time progresses. You will learn about KPIs in the chapter - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Power View.</p>
<p>The chapter also has a brief introduction on KPIs, KPI parameters and how to identify KPIs. But, note that this is not exhaustive as KPIs depend on the field you have chosen to track the progress – for e.g. business performance, sales, HR, etc</p>
<h3>Formatting a Power View Report</h3>
<p>The Power View visualizations as you learn throughout the tutorial are ready to present any time, as they are all appealing and presentable. Because of the dynamic nature of the visualizations, it is easy to display the required results on the sport without much effort or time. As everything is visual, there will not be any need to preview the results. Hence, in Power View reporting is not the final step and can be at any point of time with your Power View and visualizations.</p>
<p>In the chapter – Formatting a Power View Report, you will learn some more features that can change the look and feel of your already appealing Power View reports. These include changing Theme, setting background image, changing background colors, font and text size, formatting numbers and changing number aggregates.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Work</h3>
<p>You can share your work with the concerned as the Power View sheets in your Excel workbook itself on server / cloud by giving appropriate permissions to read /edit. As Power View is also available on SharePoint, you can share your Power View reports as SharePoint reports. You can print Power View sheets, but as they are static, it would not make much sense to print them because of their innate powerful features of interactivity and dynamic nature. You can publish Power View sheets to Power BI.</p>
<h3>Data Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>The data that is used to the maximum extent is the Olympics results data for the years 1900 – 2014. The data table has around 35,000 rows of data that could reveal the power features of the optimistic Data Model and Power View visualizations.</p>
<p>Sincere thanks to all those involved in providing this data onsite &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Olympics Official Results &minus; <a href="https://www.olympic.org/olympic-games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.olympic.org/olympic-games</a></p></li>
<li><p>Olympics Sport Images &minus; <b>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not the least Microsoft Office Support that gave the idea of choosing Olympics data to render the power of Power View Visualizations.</p>
<h1>Excel Power View - Creation</h1>
<p>Power View is like a canvas on which you can have any number of visualizations based on your Data Model. You need to start with creating a Power View sheet and then add fields from the data tables to Power View to visualize and explore data.</p>
<p>Before you start your data exploration with Power View, make sure that the Power View add-in enabled and available on the Ribbon.</p>
<p>Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon. Power View should be visible on the Ribbon in the Reports group.</p>
<img src="images/insert.jpg" alt="Insert" />
<h2>Enabling Power View Add-in</h2>
<p>If you do not find Power View on the Ribbon, you need to enable the Power View add-in.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the File tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Options.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Add-Ins in the Excel Options dialog box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the drop-down arrow in the Manage box.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>COM Add-ins</b> from the dropdown list and click <b>Go</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/excel_otions_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Excel Options Dialog Box" />
<p>The COM Add-ins dialog box appears. Check the box Power View and click OK.</p>
<img src="images/com_add_ins.jpg" alt="COM Add-Ins" />
<p>Power View will be visible on the Ribbon.</p>
<h2>Creating a Power View Sheet</h2>
<p>You can create a Power View from the data tables in the Data Model.</p>
<p>Suppose you have the following Data Model in your workbook.</p>
<img src="images/power_view_sheet.jpg" alt="Power View Sheet" />
<p>To create a Power View sheet, do the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the INSERT tab on the Ribbon in Excel window.</li>
<li>Click Power View in the Reports group.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Opening Power View</b> message box appears with a horizontally scrolling green status bar. This might take a little while.</p>
<img src="images/opening_power_view.jpg" alt="Opening Power View" />
<p>The <b>Power View</b> sheet is created as a worksheet in your Excel workbook. It contains an empty Power View area, Filters area and the Power View Fields list displaying the tables in the Data Model. Power View appears as a tab on the Ribbon in the Power View sheet.</p>
<img src="images/power_view_sheet1.jpg" alt="Power View Sheet1" />
<p>You will understand these different parts of the Power View sheet in the next chapter.</p>
<h2>Creating a Power View</h2>
<p>In this section, you will understand how to create a Power View in the Power View sheet.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to display the medals that each country has won.</p>
<p>Select the fields Country and Medal from the Results table. These two fields appear under <b>FIELDS</b> in the Areas. Power View will be displayed as a Table with the two selected fields as columns.</p>
<img src="images/selected_fields.jpg" alt="Selected Fields" />
<p>As you can see, Power View is displaying which medals each country has won.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the Title of the Power View sheet.</li>
<li>Type Medals.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/medals.jpg" alt="Medals" />
<h1>Excel Power View - Sheet</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, you have created a Power View sheet and a Power View on the Power View sheet. Note that you can create multiple Power Views on a Power View sheet. They are called Visualizations. You will learn about the various different visualizations that you can create on a Power View sheet in the subsequent chapters. Before you learn about the different visualizations, you need to understand the various parts of the Power View sheet.</p>
<h2>Power View Sheet Layout</h2>
<p>The Power View sheet layout looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="images/power_view_sheet_layout.jpg" alt="Power View Sheet Layout" />
<p>You can find the following different parts on the Power View sheet.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Power View Area.</li>
<li>Power View Visualizations.</li>
<li>Power View Title.</li>
<li>Power View Fields List.</li>
<li>Filters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Power View Area</h3>
<p>Power View area is like a canvas on which you can create multiple different visualizations based on the data in the Data Model. You can have multiple visualizations in the Power View area and work on them either collectively or separately. To create a new visualization, you need to click on an empty part of the Power View area, and select the fields that you want to display in the visualization.</p>
<h3>Power View Visualizations</h3>
<p>The variety of visualizations that Power View provides is the strength of Power View. You can have any number of visualizations on the Power View area and each with different size and different layout. For example, you can have a Table visualization, a Chart visualization and a Map visualization on a single Power View. The fields that are displayed in the visualizations can be individually chosen.</p>
<p>The sizes of the visualizations can be different.</p>
<p>To resize a visualization, do the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the symbol <img class="inline" src="images/up_arrow.jpg" alt="Up Arrow" /> in the top right corner, or</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the symbol <img class="inline" src="images/down_arrow.jpg" alt="Down Arrow" /> in the bottom right corner and pull the arrow that appears</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pop out and Pop in</h3>
<p>You can make a visualization to occupy the entire Power View area with the Pop out button <img class="inline" src="images/pop_out_in.jpg" alt="Pop Out In" />that appears on the top right corner of the visualization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Move the cursor to the Table visualization.</p></li>
<li><p>Move to the top right corner of the Table visualization. The Pop out button is highlighted.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/pop_out.jpg" alt="Pop Out" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Pop out button. The Table visualization pops out to the entire Power View area.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pop out button changes to Pop in button.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Pop in button.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/pop_in_button.jpg" alt="Pop In Button" />
<p>The Table visualization reverts to the original size.</p>
<h3>Power View Fields List</h3>
<p>The Power View Fields list displays all the tables in the Data Model and the corresponding fields. By selecting the fields, you can display the required data in a visualization. Note that you can choose different fields for the different visualizations on a Power View sheet. This makes Power View a versatile and collective tool to visualize the different aspects of the data in the Data Model.</p>
<p>While the selected fields in the Power View Fields list determine what data is to be displayed in a visualization, the areas below the Fields list determine how the data is to be displayed. For example, you might choose to display the fields - Country, Sport, Gender, and Medal Count in the visualization. While placing these fields in the Areas, you can opt to display Gender as a Legend. You will learn the different types of Areas and the way they can change the layout of a visualization in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>The Title in a Power View sheet is for the entire sheet. Therefore, while giving a Title, see to that it meets the objective of the entire Power View report.</p>
<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>The Filters area allows you to filter the fields for specific data that is to be displayed. You can choose to apply a filter to the entire View, i.e. all the visualizations or only the selected visualization.</p>
<p>Click Table visualization.</p>
<img src="images/filters.jpg" alt="Filters" />
<p>As you can observe, the Filters area has two tabs – VIEW and TABLE.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you click the tab <b>TABLE</b> and apply the filters to fields, only the data in the selected <b>TABLE</b> visualization will be filtered.</p></li>
<li><p>If you click on the tab <b>VIEW</b> and apply the filters to fields, the data in all the visualizations in the Power View sheet will be filtered.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the visualization is other than Table, say Matrix, then the tabs in the Filters area will be <b>VIEW</b> and <b>MATRIX</b>.</p>
<p>You will learn about Filters in detail in the chapter - Combination of Power View Visualizations.</p>
<h2>Power View Tabs on the Ribbon</h2>
<p>Power View has three tabs on the Ribbon &minus; <b>Power View, Design, and Layout.</b></p>
<p>When you create a Power View Sheet, the tab – POWER VIEW is added to the Ribbon.</p>
<img src="images/power_view.jpg" alt="Power View" />
<p>When you create a Power View (visualization) such as Table visualization and click it, the tab – <b>DESIGN</b> is added to the Ribbon.</p>
<img src="images/design.jpg" alt="Design" />
<p>When you switch visualization to a Chart or Map, the tab – LAYOUT is added to the Ribbon.</p>
<img src="images/layout.jpg" alt="Layout" />
<h1>Excel Power View - Visualizations</h1>
<p>Power View is an interactive data exploration and visualization tool in Excel. Power View supports various visualizations such as Tables, Matrices, Cards, Charts such as Bar, Column, Scatter, Line, Pie and Bubble Charts and Maps. You can also create sets of multiple charts (charts with same axis) in Power View.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will understand each Power View visualization briefly. You will understand the details in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<h2>Table Visualization</h2>
<p>For every visualization that you want to create on a Power View sheet, you have to start by creating a Table first. You can then quickly switch among the visualizations to find the one that best suits your data.</p>
<p>The Table looks like any other data table with columns representing fields and rows representing data values. You can select and deselect fields in the Power View Fields list to choose the fields that are to be displayed in the Table.</p>
<img src="images/table_visualization.jpg" alt="Table Visualization" />
<h2>Switch Visualization</h2>
<p>Once you create a Table visualization that is default, you can convert it into any other visualization as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on Table visualization. Two tabs, <b>POWER VIEW</b> and <b>DESIGN</b> appear on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>DESIGN</b> tab.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/switch_visualization.jpg" alt="Switch Visualization" />
<p>There are several visualization options in the Switch Visualization group on the Ribbon. You can choose any of these options.</p>
<h2>Matrix Visualization</h2>
<p>Matrix Visualization is similar to a Table Visualization as it also contains rows and columns of data. However, a matrix has some additional features such as displaying the data without repeating values, displaying totals and subtotals by columns and/or rows, drill down/drill up a hierarchy, etc.</p>
<img src="images/matrix.jpg" alt="Matrix" />
<h2>Card Visualization</h2>
<p>In a card visualization, you will have a series of snapshots that display the data from each row in the table, laid out like an index card.</p>
<img src="images/card_visualization.jpg" alt="Card Visualization" />
<h2>Chart Visualizations</h2>
<p>In Power View, you have a number of Chart options: Bar, Column, Line, Scatter, Bubble, and Pie.</p>
<img src="images/chart_visualization.jpg" alt="Chart Visualization" />
<h2>Map Visualization</h2>
<p>If your data has fields pertaining to geography, you can use Maps in Power View to display the values. Maps in Power View use Bing map tiles and hence you need to make sure that you are online when you are displaying a Map visualization.</p>
<img src="images/map_visualization1.jpg" alt="Map Visualization1" />
<p>You can use Pie Charts for data points in a Map Visualization.</p>
<img src="images/map_visualization2.jpg" alt="Map Visualization" />
<h1>Excel Power View - Table Visualization</h1>
<p>In Power View, for every visualization you want to create, you start by creating a Table, which is the default and then convert the Table to other visualizations easily.</p>
<p>The Table looks like any other data table with columns representing fields and rows representing data values. You can select and deselect fields in the Power View Fields list to choose the fields that are to be displayed in the Table. The fields can be from the same data table or from different related data tables.</p>
<h2>Creating a Table</h2>
<p>To create a Table in Power View, do the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the Power View area.</li>
<li>Click on the table – Results in the Power View Fields list.</li>
<li>Select the fields Country, Sport, and Medal.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Table will be displayed on Power View with selected fields as columns, containing the actual values.</p>
<img src="images/creating_a_table.jpg" alt="Creating a Table" />
<h2>Understanding Table Visualization</h2>
<p>You can see that the selected fields appear in the FIELDS area under the Power View Fields list. The columns are formatted according to their data type, as defined in the data model that the report is based on.</p>
<p>The order of the fields in the FIELDS area represents the order of the columns in the Table. You can change the order by dragging the fields in the FIELDS area. You can sort the Table by any column by clicking on the column name. The sort order can be ascending or descending by values.</p>
<p>You can filter the data in the Table by choosing the filtering options in the Filters area, under the <b>Table</b> tab. You can add fields to the <b>Table</b> by dragging the field either to the Table in Power View or to the <b>FIELDS</b> area. If you drag a field to the Power View area and not to the Table, a new Table is displayed.</p>
<h2>Adding a Field to Table as Count</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to display the Medal Count as a column. You can do it by adding the field Medal to the Table as Count.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the arrow next to the field, <b>Medal</b>, in the Power View Fields list.</li>
<li>Select <b>Add to Table as Count</b> from the dropdown list.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/adding_fields.jpg" alt="Adding Fields" />
<p>A new column Count of Medal will be added to the Table, displaying the Medal Count values.</p>
<img src="images/table_count.jpg" alt="Table Count" />
<h2>Adding a Count Field to Table</h2>
<p>As your data has more than 34000 rows, adding the field Medal as Count to the Table is not an efficient approach, as Power View has to do the calculation whenever you change the layout of the Table.</p>
<p>The more effective way is to add a calculated field to the Medals data table in the Data Model.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the PowerPivot tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click on Manage in the Data Model group. The tables in the Data Model will be displayed.</li>
<li>Click on the Results tab.</li>
<li>In the Results table, in the calculation area, in the cell below the Medal column, type the following DAX formula</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Medal Count:=COUNTA([Medal])</b></p>
<img src="images/medical_count.jpg" alt="Medical Count" />
<p>You can see that the medal count formula appears in the formula bar and to the left of the formula bar, the column name Medal is displayed.</p>
<p>In the Power View sheet, you will get a Power View message that the Data Model is changed and if you click OK, the changes will be reflected in your Power View. Click OK.</p>
<img src="images/adding_count_field.jpg" alt="Adding Count Field" />
<p>In the Power View Fields list, you can observe the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A new field Medal Count is added in the Results table.</p></li>
<li><p>A calculator icon appears adjacent to the field Medal Count, indicating that it is a calculated field.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the fields – Country, Sport, and Medal Count.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your Power View Table displays the medal count country wise and sport wise.</p>
<img src="images/calculated_field.jpg" alt="Calculated Field" />
<h2>Filtering Table in Power View</h2>
<p>You can filter the values displayed in the Table by defining the filter criteria.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the TABLE tab in the Filters area.</li>
<li>Click Medal Count.</li>
<li>Click the icon <b>Advanced filter mode</b> to the right of Medal Count.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/advanced_filter_mode.jpg" alt="Advanced Filter Mode" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select <b>is greater than or equal to</b> from the dropdown list under <b>Show items for which the value</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 100 in the box below that and then click <b>Apply Filter</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/medal_count.jpg" alt="Medal Count" />
<p>The <b>Table</b> will display only those records with <b>Medal Count >= 100</b>.</p>
<img src="images/filtered_table.jpg" alt="Filtered Table" />
<h1>Excel Power View - Matrix Visualization</h1>
<p>Matrix visualization is similar to a Table visualization in that it also contains rows and columns of data. However, a Matrix has additional features such as hierarchy, not repeating values, etc.</p>
<p>As you have learnt in the previous chapters, you need to start with a Table and then convert it to Matrix.</p>
<p>Choose the fields – Country, Sport, and Medal Count. A Table representing these fields appears in Power View.</p>
<img src="images/table.jpg" alt="Table" />
<h2>Switching to Matrix Visualization</h2>
<p>Convert the Table to Matrix as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the Table.</li>
<li>Click the DESIGN tab.</li>
<li>Click Table in the Switch Visualization group.</li>
<li>Select Matrix from the dropdown list.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/matrix_design.jpg" alt="Matrix Design" />
<p>The Table is converted to Matrix.</p>
<img src="images/medals_matrix.jpg" alt="Medals Matrix" />
<h2>Advantages of Matrix Visualization</h2>
<p>A Matrix has the following advantages &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>It can display the data without repeating values.</li>
<li>It can display totals and subtotals by columns and/or rows.</li>
<li>If it contains a hierarchy, you can drill down/drill up.</li>
<li>It can be collapsed and expanded by rows and/or columns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combination of Table and Matrix Visualizations</h2>
<p>You can see the differences between the Table and Matrix visualizations by having them side by side on the Power View sheet, displaying the same data.</p>
<p>Follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<p>Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport, Event, and Medal Count.</p>
<img src="images/medals_table.jpg" alt="Medals Table" />
<p>In the Table, the values of country repeated for several sport values and the values of sport are repeated for several event values.</p>
<p>Create another Table on the right side of the first Table as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Power View sheet in the space to the right of the Table.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the fields – Country, Sport, Event, and Medal Count.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another Table representing these fields appears in Power View, to the right of the earlier Table.</p>
<img src="images/combination_tables.jpg" alt="Combination Tables" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the Table on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>DESIGN</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Table in the Switch Visualization group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Matrix from the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/design_tab.jpg" alt="Design Tab" />
<p>The Table on the right in Power View is converted to Matrix.</p>
<img src="images/converted_matrix.jpg" alt="Converted Matrix" />
<p>As you can observe, the Matrix displays each country and sport only once, without repeating values as is the case in Table.</p>
<h2>Filtering Matrix in Power View</h2>
<p>You can explore the data to find the countries and the corresponding sports and events with medal count of more than 150.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Table.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Filters area, click the <b>TABLE</b> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the filtering criteria for Medal Count as - <b>is greater than or equal to 150</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Apply filter</b></p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Matrix</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Filters area, click the <b>MATRIX</b> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the filtering criteria for Medal Count as - <b>is greater than or equal to 150.</b></p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Apply filter</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/martix_power_view.jpg" alt="Matrix Power View" />
<p>In Matrix, data is displayed without repeating the values, whereas in Table data is displayed with repeated values.</p>
<h2>Totals</h2>
<p>To understand the capability of Matrix in displaying Subtotals and Totals, do the following &minus;</p>
<p>Add the fields Country, Sport, Event and Medal Count to Matrix.</p>
<img src="images/totals.jpg" alt="Totals" />
<p>As you can see, the fields – Country, Sport, and Event define the hierarchy and are nested in that order. Matrix also displays <b>Subtotals</b> at each of these Levels as shown below.</p>
<img src="images/subtotals.jpg" alt="Subtotals" />
<p>The Subtotals and Total are given as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Medal Count is at the Event Level.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtotal at the Sport Level – Sum of the Medal Count values of all Events in that Sport won by the Country that is one Level up.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtotal at the Country Level – Sum of the Subtotals at Sport Level.</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom of the Matrix, the Total row is displayed that sums up all the Medal Count values.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Look at a variation of the same Matrix &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Add the fields Country, Sport, and Medal Count to Matrix.</li>
<li>Filter the Matrix to display only values with Medal Count more than 250.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/sport_level.jpg" alt="Sport Level" />
<p>The Medal Count values are displayed as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>At Sport Level &minus; Total Medal Count of all the Medal Counts at Event Levels in the Sport.</p></li>
<li><p>At Country Level &minus; Subtotal of all the Medal Count values at Sport Levels in the Country.</p></li>
<li><p>Total Row &minus; Total of all the Subtotals of all the Countries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to display the Subtotals and Total rows in Matrix, do the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>DESIGN</b> tab.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/options.jpg" alt="Options" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click <b>Totals</b> in the Options group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>None</b> from the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/none.jpg" alt="None" />
<p>Totals will not be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/total_medals.jpg" alt="Total Medals" />
<p>To display the <b>Subtotals</b> and <b>total</b> again, do the following</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the Matrix.</li>
<li>Click the DESIGN tab.</li>
<li>Click Totals in the Options group.</li>
<li>Select Rows from the dropdown list.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/rows.jpg" alt="Rows" />
<p>The Rows with Subtotals and Total will be displayed. As you can see, this is the default mode in Matrix.</p>
<h1>Excel Power View - Card Visualization</h1>
<p>In a Card visualization, you will have a series of snapshots that display the data from each row in the table, laid out like an index card.</p>
<p>Consider the Data Model, where we have added the table SportPics.</p>
<img src="images/sportpics.jpg" alt="SportPics" />
<p>You need to start with a Table and then convert it to Card.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Choose the fields &minus; Country, Sport, SportImage and Medal Count. The Table representing these fields appears in Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>Filter the Table to display data with Medal Count more than 275.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/power_view_card.jpg" alt="Power View Card" />
<p>The values in the column SportImage are images. It is possible to add images to your Power View visualizations. The images are data bound, i.e. a sport image is linked to the corresponding sport. You will learn more about images in subsequent chapters.</p>
<h2>Switching to Card Visualization</h2>

<h1>Excel Power View - Map Visualization</h1>
<p>You can use Maps to display your data in the context of geography. Maps in Power View use Bing map tiles, so you can zoom and pan as you would with any other Bing map. To make maps work, Power View has to send the data to Bing through a secured web connection for geocoding. Therefore, it asks you to enable content, adding locations and values places dots on the map. The larger the value, the bigger will be the dot. When you add a multi-value series, you will get Pie charts for data points on the map, with the size of the Pie Chart showing the size of the total.</p>

<h1>Excel Power View - Tiles Visualization</h1>
<p>In case you have lot of data to display with significant data points at varied places, you might have to scroll very often in your Power View visualizations to find the data you are looking for. This would be tedious and also might not be smooth when you are presenting the results.</p>
<p>You can overcome this drudgery using the Tiles feature in Power View. With Tiles, you can gain insights from your data much more quickly. Tiles act as navigation strips, with a single Tile for each possible field value. When you click on a Tile, only the data related to that field value is displayed. As it is easy to scroll the values in the navigation strip that dynamically changes the corresponding values in the visualization, Tiles become an easy to use tool for you.</p>
<p>You can have Tiles in a Table, Matrix, Card and Chart or Map visualization. You can have a combination of these visualizations in Power View with a single Tile Navigation Strip and get them filtered with a Tile. A Tile can be simple text or an image.</p>

<h1>Excel Power View - Advanced Features</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters you have learnt about the different possible Power View visualizations, Multiples and Tiles. The fields you select for display in the visualizations depend on what you want to explore, analyze and present. For example, in most of the visualizations that you have seen so far, we have chosen Medal to analyze Medal Count by medal type. You might want to explore, analyze and present the data gender-wise. In such a case, you need to choose the field Gender.</p>
<p>Further, visualization also depends on the data you are displaying. Throughout this tutorial, we have chosen Olympics data in order to visualize the power of Power View, the ease with which you can handle large data and switch over different visualizations on the fly. However, your data set might be different.</p>
<p>You need to choose a visualization that best suits your data. If you are not sure about the suitability, you can just play around with the visualizations to choose the right one as switching across the visualizations is quick and simple in Power View. Moreover, you can also do it in the presentation view, in order to answer any queries that can arise during a presentation.</p>
<p>You have also seen how you can have a combination of visualizations in a Power View and the interactive nature of the visualizations. You will learn advanced features in Power View in this chapter. These features come handy for reporting.</p>
<h2>Creating a Default Field Set for Table</h2>
<p>You might have to use the same field set for different visualizations in a Power View. As you are aware, to display any visualization, you need to create a Table visualization first. If the fields for the Table visualization are from the same data table, you can create a default field set for Table so that you can select the default field set with one click, instead of selecting the fields for the Table visualization repeatedly.</p>

<p>The selected fields appear in the Default fields, in order box on the right side.</p>
<img src="images/default_fields.jpg" alt="Default Fields" />
<p>Click the <b>Move Up</b> or <b>Move Down</b> buttons to order the fields in the Default fields, in order box and click OK.</p>
<img src="images/default_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Default Dialog Box" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Power View sheet in the Excel window. A message ‘Data Model is changed’ appears and click OK to make those changes in Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the data table name – Results in the Power View Fields list. Table visualization with the default field set appears in Power View</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/default_power_view.jpg" alt="Default Power View" />
<p>Note that you have to click only on the data table name in the Power View Fields list to select the default field set. If you click on the arrow next to data table name, it expands showing all the fields in the data table and in Power View, Table visualization does not appear.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click in the empty space to the right of Table visualization in Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the data table name - Results in the Power View Fields list. Another Table visualization with the default field set appears in Power View.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/power_view_field_set.jpg" alt="Power View Field Set" />
<p>As you can see, you are able to create a Table visualization with 5 fields in the desired order with a single click using the default field set. This eliminates the cumbersome selection of the 5 fields in the desired order with 5 clicks each time you want to display a</p>
<p>Table (or any other) visualization. However, you should be sure of which fields should be in the default field set in a data table. Hence, this feature can be used after data exploration, visualization is complete, and you are ready to produce reports. You might have to produce several reports, in which case this feature comes handy.</p>
<h2>Setting Table Behavior</h2>
<p>You can set the default table behavior that Power View uses to create report labels automatically for the data table. This becomes useful when you create visualizations from the same data table, perhaps for many different reports.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a data table – Olympics Results in the Data Model</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the data table Olympics Results in the Power Pivot window.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Advanced tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Table Behavior</b> in the Reporting Options group. The <b>Table Behavior</b> dialog box appears</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/table_behavior.jpg" alt="Table Behavior" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select <b>EventID</b> under the <b>Row Identifier</b> box. This column should have unique values in the data table.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the boxes <b>Event</b> and <b>EventID</b> in the Keep Unique Rows box. These columns should have row values that are unique, and should not be aggregated when creating Power View reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Sport</b> in the <b>Default Label</b> box.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>SportImage</b> in the Default Image box.</p></li>
<li><p>Click OK.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/table_behavior_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Table Behavior Dialog Box" />
<p>To visualize the Table behavior that you have set, select the fields as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on Power View.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the fields – Sport, SportImage, Event, Year, Athlete, Country and Medal in that order. By default, Table visualization appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/select_fields.jpg" alt="Select Fields" />
<p>Switch visualization to Card.</p>
<img src="images/switch_visualization_card.jpg" alt="Switch Visualization Card" />
<p>The <b>Sport</b> field values are larger than the other field values and appear as headings for the Cards. This is because you have set Sport as the Default Label in the Table Behavior dialog box. Further, you have set <b>SportImage</b> as the Default Image that appears on each Card based on the Sport value.</p>
<h2>Filtering Values in a View</h2>
<p>Suppose you have three Power View visualizations – Matrix, Stacked Column Chart and sophisticated Pie Chart in the same Power View, each displaying different aspects of data.</p>
<img src="images/filtering_values.jpg" alt="Filtering Values" />
<p>You can see that all the three visualizations are displaying data for all the Country values.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to display data only for USA, URS and JPN. You can apply the filter criteria on the field Country in View rather than in each visualization separately.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click in the Filters area.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>VIEW</b> tab. The Filters area will be empty and no fields will be displayed, as you have not yet selected any.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the field Country from Power View Fields list to Filters area. The field Country with all the values appears in the Filters area.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the boxes - USA, URS and JPN.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/medals_view.jpg" alt="Medals View" />
<p>You can see that all the visualizations in the Power View were filtered at once.</p>
<h2>Adding Title to Power View</h2>
<p>The Title in the Power View is common to all visualizations. Hence, it should be meaningful across the visualizations. At the top of the Power View, you will see – <b>Click here to add a title</b>.</p>
<img src="images/adding_title.jpg" alt="Adding Title" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Click the placeholder and type Medal Count for JPN, URS and USA.</li>
<li>Click the Text tab on the Ribbon and format the Title.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/medal_count_for_jpn.jpg" alt="Medal Count for JPN" />
<h2>Adding Data Labels in a Chart Visualization</h2>
<p>You can add Data Labels in a Chart visualization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Clustered Column Chart.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the LAYOUT tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Data Labels</b> in the Labels group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Show</b> from the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/medal_count_layout.jpg" alt="Medal Count Layout" />
<p>Data Labels appear in the Column Chart.</p>
<img src="images/data_labels_in_chart.jpg" alt="Data Labels In Chart" />
<h2>Interactive Data Visualization in Power View</h2>
<p>The efficiency of Power View is in its ability to make you visualize data interactively within no time.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the Pie Chart.</li>
<li>Drag Medal from COLOR area to SLICES area.</li>
<li>Drag Country from Power View Fields list to COLOR area.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/interactive_data.jpg" alt="Interactive Data" />
<p>The Pie Chart shows Country values – JPN, URS and USA as you have applied this filter to VIEW.</p>
<p>Click on the Pie Slice – USA, Gold.</p>
<img src="images/pie_slice_power_view.jpg" alt="Pie Slice Power View" />
<p>The Matrix is filtered to show only the values corresponding to the highlighted Pie Slice. In the Column Chart, the distribution of Gold Medals among Men and Women is highlighted for USA. Thus, efficient presentations with Power View is just a click away.</p>
<h2>Changing the Sort Order of a Field</h2>
<p>As you are aware, each field will have default sort order. In the visualizations that you have seen so far, the Medal field is sorted by the default order – Bronze, Gold, and Silver. This is because the text field is sorted in ascending order. However, while reporting, you might want to display the order as Gold, Silver and Bronze as it would be more appealing.</p>
<p>Add a field by which you can sort the Medal field in the desired order as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Create a new worksheet in your workbook.</li>
<li>Create an Excel table as given below.</li>
<li>Name the table as Medal_Position.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/medal_position.jpg" alt="Medal Position" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>POWERPIVOT</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Add to Data Model in the Tables group.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/data_model.jpg" alt="Data Model" />
<p>The table Medal_Position will be added to Data Model as a data table.</p>
<img src="images/data_medal_position.jpg" alt="Data Medal Position" />
<p>Create a relationship between the data tables Results and Medal Position with the field Medal.</p>
<img src="images/data_tables.jpg" alt="Data Tables" />
<p>Add the field Medal Position to Results data table as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Click on the Data View in the Power Pivot window.</li>
<li>Click the Results tab.</li>
<li>Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.</li>
<li>Click Add.</li>
<li>The Add Column on the extreme right of the data table will be highlighted.</li>
<li>Type the following DAX formula in the formula bar and press Enter.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>=RELATED(Medal_Position[Medal Position])</b></p>
<img src="images/dax_formula.jpg" alt="DAX Formula" />
<p>A new column will be added to the Results data table. The header of the column would be Calculated Column1.</p>
<p>Change the column header to Medal Position by double clicking on it.</p>
<img src="images/column1.jpg" alt="Column1" />
<p>As you can observe, the Medal Position column is filled as per the values in the Medal column and as defined in the Medal_Position data table.</p>
<p>Specify how Power View should sort the Medal field as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select the Medal column.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Sort by Column</b> in the Sort and Filter group.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Sort by Column</b> from the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/sort_by_column.jpg" alt="Sort by Column" />

<ul class="list">
<li>Ensure Medal is in the Sort Column box.</li>
<li>Select Medal Position in the By Column box.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/sort_by_column_medal_position.jpg" alt="Sort by Column Medal Position" />
<p>The visualizations will be updated automatically to the new sort order.</p>
<img src="images/updated_automatically.jpg" alt="Updated Automatically" />
<h2>Filtering Visualizations with Slicers</h2>
<p>You can filter Power View visualizations with Slicers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on Power View next to the Map.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the field Gender from Power View Fields list to Power View. A Table appears by default.</p></li>

<h1>Excel Power View and Data Model</h1>
<p>Power View is based on the Data Model in your workbook that is created and managed by Power Pivot. You can access the Data Model from the Power Pivot window. Because of the optimization that Power Pivot uses in managing the Power Pivot window, you would be able to work with large data sets on the fly. Power View visualizations and their interactive features are possible because of the Data Model.</p>
<p>You can also create and/or modify the Data Model from the Power View sheet in your workbook.</p>
<p>For those readers for whom Data Model concepts in Excel are new, suggest to refer to Excel Power Pivot tutorial for the details. In this chapter, you will learn more about Power View and Data Model.</p>
<h2>Power View and Data Model</h2>
<p>You have learnt that Power View is based on the Data Model that is created and managed in Power Pivot window. You have also seen the Power of interactive visualizations that are based on large data such as Olympics data that is made part of the Data Model.</p>
<p>When you have a Data Model in your workbook, whenever you create a Power View sheet, it automatically gets the data tables from the Data Model along with the relationships defined among them, so that you can select fields from the related data tables.</p>
<p>If you have Excel tables in your workbook, you can link them to the data tables in the Data Model. However, if you have large data sets such as Olympics data, the Power View is optimized by directly creating the Data Model from the data source.</p>
<p>Once you have the Data Model in your workbook and relationships defined among the tables, you are all set to visualize and explore data in Power View.</p>
<p>You can refresh the data in the Data Model to update the modifications made in the data sources from where you have created the Data Model.</p>
<h2>Creating Data Model from Power View Sheet</h2>
<p>You can also create the Data Model directly from the Power View sheet as follows &minus;</p>
<p>Start with a new workbook that contains Salesperson data and Sales data in two worksheets.</p>
<img src="images/range_of_data.jpg" alt="Range of Data" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a table from the range of data in the Salesperson worksheet and name it Salesperson.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a table from the range of data in the Sales worksheet and name it Sales.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You have two tables – Salesperson and Sales in your workbook.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>Sales</b> table in the Sales worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>INSERT</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Power View in the Reports group.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/insert_power_view.jpg" alt="Insert Power View" />
<p>A new Power View sheet will be created in your workbook. A Table visualization appears with all the fields in the Sales table. Note that you do not have a Data Model in your workbook.</p>
<img src="images/active_data_table.jpg" alt="Active Data Table" />
<p>As you can observe in the Power View Fields list, both the tables that are in the workbook are displayed. However, in the Power View only the active table (Sales) fields are displayed.</p>
<p>In the Table in the Power View, Salesperson ID is displayed. Suppose you want to display the Salesperson name instead.</p>
<p>In the Power View Fields list, make the following changes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Deselect the field Salesperson ID in the Sales table.</li>
<li>Select the field Salesperson in the Salesperson table.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you do not have a Data Model in the workbook, no relationship exists between the two tables. No data is displayed in Power View. Excel displays messages directing you what to do.</p>
<img src="images/create_selected_fields.jpg" alt="Create Selected Fields" />
<p>A CREATE button will be displayed in the Power View Fields pane. Click the CREATE button.</p>
<p>A <b>Create Relationship</b> dialog box appears in the Power View Sheet itself.</p>
<img src="images/relationship_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Relationship Dialog Box" />
<p>Create a relationship between the two tables using the Salesperson ID field.</p>
<p>Without closing the Power View sheet, you have successfully created the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The Data Model with the two tables, and</li>
<li>The relationship between the two tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>The field <b>Salesperson</b> appears in the Table in Power View along with the Sales data.</p>
<img src="images/salesperson.jpg" alt="Salesperson" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Rearrange the fields in the FIELDS area to Region, Salesperson and ∑ Order Amount in that order.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the field Month to the area TILE BY.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch visualization to Matrix.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/visualization_matrix.jpg" alt="Visualization Matrix" />
<p>You can see that for each of the Regions, the Salespersons of that Region and sum of Order Amount are displayed. Subtotals are displayed for each Region. The display is month-wise as selected in the Tiles. When you select a Month in the Tiles, the data of that Month will be displayed in the Matrix.</p>
<p>You are able to work with the Power View visualizations as the Data Model is now created. You can check it in the Power Pivot window.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the <b>POWERPIVOT</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Manage</b> in the Data Model group. The Power Pivot window appears.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/manage_data.jpg" alt="Manage Data" />
<p>The data tables – Salesperson and Sales are created in the Data Model along with the defined relationship.</p>
<h2>Modifying Data Model from Power View Sheet</h2>
<p>You can also modify the Data Model in your workbook from the Power View sheet by adding data tables and creating relationships among the data tables.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Consider the Excel table – SalesTarget in your workbook.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/salestarget.jpg" alt="SalesTarget" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Power View sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the Matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch visualization to Table.</p></li>
<li><p>Deselect the field – Month.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>ALL</b> tab in the Power View Fields pane. You can see that the table SalesTarget is included.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>POWERPIVOT</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Manage. The Power Pivot window appears displaying the Data Model.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/power_pivot.jpg" alt="Power Pivot" />
<p>You can add a data table to the Data Model from Power View itself.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Power View sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the field <b>SalesTarget</b> in the SalesTarget table in the Power View Fields list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/sales_summary.jpg" alt="Sales Summary" />
<p>The new field SalesTarget is added to the table, but a message saying – Relationships between tables may be needed. A <b>CREATE</b> button appears.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the CREATE button. The <b>Create Relationship</b> dialog box appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a relationship with the SalesPersonID field and click OK.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/create_relationship.jpg" alt="Create Relationship" />
<p>Click in the Power Pivot window.</p>
<img src="images/pivot_window.jpg" alt="Pivot Window" />
<p>The relationship you have created in the Power View sheet is reflected in the Data Model.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the arrow in the field SalesTarget in the FIELDS area in the Power View Fields pane.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Do Not Summarize</b> from the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/not_summarize.jpg" alt="Not Summarize" />
<p>Rearrange the fields in the Fields area.</p>
<img src="images/fields_sales_summary.jpg" alt="Fields Sales Summary" />
<h1>Excel Power View - Hierarchies</h1>
<p>If your Data Model has a hierarchy, you can use it in Power View. You can also create a new hierarchy from scratch in Power View. In both the cases, you can drill up and drill down the hierarchy in Power View.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to view the hierarchy and drill up and drill down the hierarchy in different Power View visualizations.</p>
<h2>Viewing a Hierarchy from Data Model</h2>
<p>If you have a hierarchy in Data Model, you can visualize the same in Power View. Suppose, you have the hierarchy Sport-Event defined in the Data Model as shown below.</p>
<img src="images/hierarchy_from_data_model.jpg" alt="Hierarchy from Data Model" />
<p>The hierarchy will be visible as a field in the Power View Fields list and you can add it as any other field to a Power View visualization.</p>
<img src="images/hierarchy_power_view.jpg" alt="Hierarchy Power View" />
<ul class="list">
<li>Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport-Event and Medal Count.</li>
<li>Switch visualization to Matrix.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/hierarchy_level1.jpg" alt="Hierarchy Level1" />
<p>The levels in the hierarchy are nested as per the order of fields in the hierarchy.</p>
<h2>Creating a Hierarchy in Power View</h2>
<p>You can also create a new hierarchy from scratch in Power View.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a Table with the fields - Country, Sport, Event, Year, and Medal Count, in that order.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch visualization to Matrix.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The hierarchy is set by the order of the fields in the ROWS area. You can place the fields in any order in a hierarchy in Power View, provided it is meaningful. You can change the order by simply dragging the fields in the ROWS area.</p>
<img src="images/hierarchy_level2.jpg" alt="Hierarchy Level2" />
<p>The difference between defining the hierarchy in Data Model and defining the hierarchy in Power View is the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you define a hierarchy in Data Model, it is added to Power View Fields list as a field and you can include it in any visualization in Power View by just adding that field.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if you define a hierarchy in Power View, it is restricted to the visualization in which you have placed the fields in the hierarchy order. It needs to be recreated in every visualization that is in the Power View.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Drilling Up and Drilling Down the Hierarchy in Matrix</h2>
<p>Once you have a hierarchy in Power View (either from Data Model or from Power View), you can drill up and drill down in Matrix, Bar Chart, Column Chart and Pie Chart visualizations. In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill down the hierarchy in Matrix visualization. In the subsequent sections, you will understand how to do the same in the other mentioned visualizations.</p>
<p>In Matrix, you can show just one level at a time. You can drill down for details and drill up for summary.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on the Matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>DESIGN</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <b>Show Levels</b> in the <b>Options</b> group.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/show_levels.jpg" alt="Show Levels" />
<p>Select <b>Rows – Enable Drill Down One Level at a Time</b> from the dropdown list.</p>
<img src="images/drill_down.jpg" alt="Drill Down" />
<p>The Matrix collapses to display only Level 1 data. You can also find an arrow on right side of the Level 1 data value indicating drill down.</p>
<img src="images/drill_down_arrow.jpg" alt="Drill Down Arrow" />
<p>Click on the drill down arrow to drill down. Alternatively, you can double click on the data value to drill down. That particular data value drills down by one Level.</p>
<img src="images/matrix_data_drilled.jpg" alt="Matrix Data Drilled" />
<p>For the data value, you have one arrow on the left indicating drill up and one arrow on the right indicating drill down.</p>
<p>You can double click on one data value in a Level to expand to show the data values under that in the next Level in the hierarchy. You can click on the drill up arrow to collapse to the data value.</p>
<h2>Hierarchy in Bar Chart</h2>
<p>In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill the hierarchy in a Stacked Bar Chart visualization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport-Event and Medal Count. Sport-Event is a hierarchy with fields Sport and Event that is defined in the Data Model.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch visualization to Stacked Bar Chart.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure Country, Sport, Event are in the AXIS area.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the field Medal to LEGEND area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A Stacked Bar Chart will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/hierarchy_bar_chart.jpg" alt="/Hierarchy Bar Chart" />
<p>The data displayed is Medal Count by <b>Country and Medal</b>.</p>
<p>Double-click a Bar, say CAN. The Stacked Bar Chart will be drilled down by one level.</p>
<img src="images/drill_up_bar_chart.jpg" alt="Drill Up Bar Chart" />
<p>The data displayed is Medal Count by Sport and Medal (This is for the Country – CAN). A small <b>up</b> arrow, indicating <b>drill up</b> appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in.</p>
<p>Now, you can either drill up to Country Level or drill down to Event Level.</p>
<p>Double click on the Bar – Figure Skating. The Stacked Bar Chart will be drilled down by one level.</p>
<img src="images/figure_skating.jpg" alt="Figure Skating" />
<p>The data displayed is Medal Count by Event and Medal (This is for the Country – CAN and Sport – Figure Skating). A small <b>up</b> arrow, indicating drill up appears in the top right corner of the Chart, adjacent to Filter and Pop-in.</p>
<p>Now, you can drill up to Sport Level (You can drill up one level at a time).</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click he <b>drill up</b> arrow. The data displayed will be Medal Count by Sport and Medal (for Country – CAN).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>drill up</b> arrow. The Stacked Bar Chart will be drilled up to Country Level.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Hierarchy in Column Chart</h2>
<p>In this section, you will understand how you can drill up and drill the hierarchy in a Stacked Column Chart visualization.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Create a Table with the fields – Country, Sport-Event and Medal Count. Sport-Event is a hierarchy with fields Sport and Event that is defined in the Data Model.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch visualization to Stacked Column Chart.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure Country, Sport, Event are in the AXIS area.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the field Medal to LEGEND area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A Stacked Column Chart will be displayed.</p>
<img src="images/column_chart_displayed.jpg" alt="Column Chart Displayed" />
<p>The data displayed is Medal Count by Country and Medal.</p>
<p>Double-click on a Column, say CHN. A Stacked Column Chart will be drilled down by one level.</p>
<img src="images/stacked_column_chart_drill_up.jpg" alt="Stacked Column Chart Drill Up" />

<li><p>Ensure Sport, Event are in the COLOR area and Medal Count is in the SIZE area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A Pie Chart will be displayed. However, as the number of Sports is many, it will not be possible to display all the Sports in the Pie Chart.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Filter the VIEW so that only the Sports – Gymnastics Rhythmic, Modern Pentathlon and Ski Jumping are displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You need to filter the VIEW and not the Pie Chart because when you drill up or drill down, the filtering needs to be in place.</p>

<h1>Key Performance Indicators</h1>
<p>A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a quantifiable measurement for gauging business objectives. Examples of KPIs are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sales department of an organization use a KPI to measure monthly gross profit against projected gross profit.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting department measure monthly expenditures against revenue to evaluate costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Human resources department measure quarterly employee turnover.</p></li>
<li><p>Business professionals frequently use KPIs that are grouped together in a business scorecard to obtain a quick and accurate historical summary of business success or to identify trends.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>KPIs are a form of communication involving the following activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Identifying the KPIs based on the organization’s objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring and reporting the KPIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Altering the KPIs as the organization progresses and / or the organization’s goals change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second and third objectives given above can be achieved with Power View. A KPI includes Base Value, Target Value/ Goal and Status.</p>
<h3>Base Value</h3>
<p>A Base Value is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value. The calculated field represents the current value for the item in that row of the Table or Matrix. For example, aggregate of sales, profit for a given period, etc.</p>
<h3>Target Value</h3>
<p>A Target Value (or Goal) is defined by a calculated field that resolves to a value, or by an absolute value. The current value is evaluated against this value. This could be one of the following</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A fixed number that is the goal all the rows should achieve. E.g. Sales target for all the salespersons.</p></li>
<li><p>A calculated field that might have a different goal for each row. For example, Budget (calculated field), department-wise in an organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Status is the visual indicator of the value. In Power View, you can edit the KPI, choosing which indicators to use and what values to trigger each indicator.</p>
<h2>Identifying the KPIs</h2>
<p>The first and the most crucial step in KPI analysis is to identify the KPIs that effectively monitor the required trends in the organization. This requires complete understanding of the objectives and requires proper communication channels between the analysts and those who are responsible for fulfilling the objectives.</p>
<p>There are a number of KPIs to choose from, but the success in monitoring relies on the right choice of those that are relevant to the objectives. The KPIs differ from organization to organization and from department to department. It is effective only when they lead to improvement in the performance.</p>
<p>You can evaluate the relevance of a KPI using the SMART criteria, i.e. the KPI should be <b>S</b>pecific, <b>M</b>easurable, <b>A</b>ttainable, <b>R</b>elevant and <b>T</b>ime-bound. In other words, the KPI chosen should meet the following criteria &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The KPI reflects your <b>S</b>pecific objective.</p></li>
<li><p>The KPI enables you to <b>M</b>easure progress towards that goal.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal for which the KPI is being defined is realistically <b>A</b>ttainable.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal that the KPI is targeting is <b>R</b>elevant to the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>You can set a <b>T</b>ime-frame for achieving the goal so that the KPI reveals how near the goal is as compared to the time that is left.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The defined KPIs are to be evaluated from time to time to find their relevance as the time progresses. If required, different KPIs need to be defined and monitored. The KPIs might have to be edited as the time progresses. Only then, your KPI monitoring will be relating to the current organization needs.</p>
<h2>Defining KPIs in the Data Model</h2>
<p>Once you identify the KPIs, you can define them in the Data Model and add them to your Power View report to show the status of the set goals. You can do any of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Define the KPIs in the Data Model and use them as fields in Power View to visualize them.</p></li>
<li><p>Define and / or edit the KPIs in Power View.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn how to define KPIs in the Data Model in this section. The other method you will learn in the next section.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to monitor the sales targets of the salespersons in an organization who are selling a product. The objective is to identify the best performers who are meeting the Sales Target. You can proceed to define the KPI as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Base Value</b> &minus; Current Value of the Sales Amount for each salesperson.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Target Value / Goal</b> &minus; Target Value is fixed for all the salespersons so as to enable comparison between the salespersons. Assume that the Sales Target is 3500.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Status</b> &minus; The Status is to be displayed with a graphic to easily determine the status of the Base Value compared to the Target Value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Define the KPI in the Data Model as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Consider the two data tables - SalesPerson and Sales.</li>
<li>Create a relationship between the two data tables using the field SalesPerson ID.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Excel Power View - Formatting a Report</h1>
<p>Once your data visualization and data exploration is complete, you will be ready to produce reports for presentation. Power View provides a wide range of Themes, Chart Palettes, Fonts, Background Colors, etc. that can help you make your reports appealing. In this chapter, you will learn about the various formatting features of Power View.</p>
<p>You know that it is possible to have a combination of Power View visualizations on a single Power View report. Some of the formatting options enable you to apply the same feature for the entire view and some options can be set separately for each of the visualizations. Further, some options will get replicated to all the Power View sheets in your workbook, while some would not.</p>
<p>The formatting features in Power View enable you to do the following &minus;</p>

<p>Adjust the sizes of the visualizations and the title so that they will be conspicuous.</p>
<img src="images/sizes_of_visualization.jpg" alt="Sizes of Visualization" />
<p>You can see that the text in the visualizations have become more readable.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The text size would be the same in all the visualizations in the report and all the other Power View sheets in your workbook as well.</p>
<h2>Formatting Numbers in a Power View Report</h2>
<p>You can format numbers in Table, Matrix and Card visualizations.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Create a Table with the fields – Country, Medal and Medal Count.</li>
<li>Switch to Matrix visualization.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/formatting_numbers.jpg" alt="Formatting Numbers" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click on a value in the Medal Count column in the Matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <b>DESIGN</b> tab on the Ribbon.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Number</b> from the dropdown list in the Number group.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/design_number.jpg" alt="Design Number" />
<p>The entire column will be formatted to number.</p>
<p>Click Decrease Indent in the Number group twice.</p>
<img src="images/decrease_indent.jpg" alt="Decrease Indent" />
<p>The data will be displayed in <b>Number</b> format. You can format numbers in Table and Card visualizations also.</p>
<img src="images/number_format.jpg" alt="Number Format" />
<h2>Changing Number Aggregates</h2>
<p>In the Power View Fields list, some number fields will have a Sigma ∑ symbol next to them. They are aggregates, meaning that you can combine the values in that field to yield a numeric value such as sum, count, or average. You can aggregate a numeric or text (non-numeric) field. However, you cannot aggregate a calculated field.</p>
<p>Create a Table with the fields Country and Medal Position.</p>
<img src="images/charts.jpg" alt="Charts" />
<p>Suppose you want to switch visualization to Stacked Bar Chart. But, as you can observe, the Chart visualizations are grayed out and disabled. You can also observe that the field Medal Position has ∑ symbol next to it, meaning that it can be aggregated.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Click the drop-down arrow next to field Medal Position in the FIELDS area.</p></li>
<li><p>Select <b>Count (Distinct)</b> from the dropdown list.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/count.jpg" alt="Count" />
<p>The field Medal Position displays a # symbol meaning it is count. In the Table, the column header changes to Count of Medal Position and the rows for each Country are displayed only once showing the count values.</p>
<p>On the Ribbon, Chart options will be enabled.</p>
<img src="images/count_of_medal_position.jpg" alt="Count of Medal Position" />
<p>Now, you can switch visualization to Stacked Bar Chart. In a similar way, you can aggregate a text field also. This feature comes handy if you do not have numeric fields in your data.</p>
<h1>Excel Power View - Sharing</h1>
<p>Power View visualizations are interactive in nature with appealing look and feel. For any type of data and for large data sets you have suitable visualizations that will enable you to explore the data with presentable reports. So, you do not have an added step of preparing and /or previewing reports. Even formatting is interactive in nature and need not necessarily be the final step. Once you have explored and summarized your results, you would have to share with the concerned people. In this chapter, you will learn the different ways that you can share Power View reports.</p>
<h2>Sharing Power View in Excel</h2>
<p>You can share your Excel workbooks with Power View sheets on a SharePoint Server 2013 or SharePoint Online site. Your report readers can view and interact with the Power View sheets in the workbooks you have saved there.</p>
<h3>Sharing Power View in SharePoint Reports</h3>
<p>You can create and share Power View reports in SharePoint (RDLX files). The readers can view them, interact and /or edit if permissions are given on the server. Power View in Excel and Power View in SharePoint Server both provide an interactive data exploration, visualization and presentation experience for all skill levels.</p>
<p>You can also export an interactive version of your Power View in SharePoint report to PowerPoint. Each view in Power View becomes a separate PowerPoint slide. You can interact with the visualizations and filters in each view, but you can’t create visualizations or filters.</p>
<h2>Printing Power View Reports</h2>
<p>You can print a Power View sheet. However, it will be a static image on paper. It will not be an interactive report, which is innate strength of Power View. You design a Power View report, on screen, with the look and feel you have in mind, which cannot be reflected on paper. Your visualizations are meant to be dynamic and cannot be captured by static images on paper to the fullest extent.</p>
<h3>Publishing to Power BI</h3>
<p>You can also publish Excel workbooks with Power View sheets to Power BI. Power BI saves the Power View sheets in your workbook as a Power BI report.</p>
