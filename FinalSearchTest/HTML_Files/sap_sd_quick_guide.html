<h1>SAP SD - Introduction</h1>
<p>SAP Sales and Distribution is one of the key components of SAP ERP system and is used to manage shipping, billing, selling and transportation of products and services in an organization.</p>
<p>SAP Sales and Distribution module is a part of SAP Logistics module that manages customer relationship starting from raising a quotation to sales order and billing of the product or service. This module is closely integrated with other modules like SAP Material Management and PP.</p>
<h2>Key Components in SAP SD</h2>
<p>The key components in SAP Sales and Distribution module are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Customer and Vendor Master Data</li>
<li>Sales Support</li>
<li>Shipping of Material</li>
<li>Sales Activities</li>
<li>Billing related</li>
<li>Transportation of products</li>
<li>Credit Management</li>
<li>Contract Handling and Management</li>
<li>Foreign Trade</li>
<li>Information System</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP Sales and Distribution Cycle</h2>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/sales_distribution_cycle.jpg" alt="Sales and Distribution Cycle"/>
<h2>SAP SD - Organizational Structure</h2>
<p>SAP provides many components to complete SAP Sales and Distribution organizational structure like Sales Areas, Distribution Channels, Divisions, etc. The SAP SD organization structure majorly consists of two steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Creation of Organization elements in SAP system, and</li>
<li>second is to link each element as per requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this organization structure in the SD module, sales organization is at highest level and is responsible for distribution of goods and services. SAP recommends to keep the number of sales organization in an organizational structure to be minimum. This will help in making the reporting process easy and ideally it should have a single sales organization.</p>
<p>The next level is distribution channel, which tells the medium by which the products and services are distributed by an organization to its end users. Division in an organizational structure, which represents a product or service line in a single organization.</p>
<p>A sales area is known as entity, which is required to process an order in a company. It comprises of sales organization, distribution channel and a division.</p>
<p>In SAP SD organizational structure, each sales organization is assigned to a company code. Then the distribution channel and divisions are assigned to sales organization and all of these comprise to make a sales area.</p>
<p>In the first step of an SD organizational structure, sales organization is assigned to a company code and then is to define a distribution channel and then division to a sales organization.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the organizational structure of a Sales and Distribution module &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/structure_sales_distribution_module.jpg" alt="Structure of Sales and Distribution Module" />
<h2>Material management</h2>
<p>Material Management is one of the key modules in SAP ERP System and covers the day to day business operations related to inventory and procurement. This module is closely integrated with other modules of R/3 systems like Finance Accounting and Controlling, Sales and Distribution, Quality Management, Product Planning.</p>
<h3>Integration with Sales and Distribution SD Module</h3>
<p>Consider an example of creating a sales order in SAP SD, it involves copying the details of items from Material Management. Availability check of the item and price details are also taken from MM, but this can be controlled in the SD module. To create inbound and outbound delivery of goods for a sales order, shipping details, loading point etc. also comes from the Material Master.</p>
<p>The item that is placed using a Sales order must be extended to the sales area of an organization to sales order/customer, otherwise it won’t be possible to transact with this material. This confirms that there is a link between SAP SD and MM module, when a sales order is created and fulfilled. Similarly, there are many other links between two modules.</p>
<h2>Finance and Accounting</h2>
<p>SAP FI stands for Financial Accounting and it is one of the important modules of SAP ERP. It is used to store the financial data of an organization. SAP FI helps to analyze the financial condition of a company in the market. It can integrate with other SAP modules like SD, PP, SAP MM, SAP SCM etc.</p>
<p>For SAP FI-MM, use <b>T-code: OBYC</b></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/finance_accounting.jpg" alt="Finance Accounting" />
<p>In case of a standard sales order, you create an outbound goods delivery to the customer. Here movement 601 takes place. This movement is configured in MM and movement of goods hit some G/L account in FI. This shows the integration between SAP SD, FI and MM module.</p>
<h2>Document Flow</h2>
<p>This shows how a transaction in one system effects the details in other systems of an SAP module.</p>
<p>Consider the following transaction &minus;</p>
<p>For SAP FI-MM, use <b>T-code: OBYC</b></p>
<p>Whenever there is a delivery created with reference to a sales order, goods movement takes place in the system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/document_flow.jpg" alt="Document Flow" />
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In case of a standard sales order in the SD module, you create an outbound goods delivery to the customer. Availability check and retail price of that product is checked in the MM module. Here, movement 601 takes place. This movement is configured in the MM and movement of goods hit some G/L account in FI. Every such movement of goods hits General Ledger account in FI.</p>
<p>The accounts posting in FI is done with reference to the billing documents like credit and debit note, invoice etc. created in SD and hence this is the link between SD and FI. This shows the document flow between different modules.</p>
<h2>Process Chain</h2>
<p>SD module is closely integrated with other SAP modules. The following tables will give you a brief idea on how SD is linked with other modules &minus;</p>

<h1>SAP SD - Customer &amp; Material Master Data</h1>
<p>Master data is one of the key factors in Sales and Distribution module. There are two levels of masters in SD.</p>
<p>The first level master includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Customer Master</li>
<li>Material Master</li>
<li>Pricing Conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>While, the second level master is &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<li>Sales Order Processing</li>
<li>Creation of Sales Order with Reference</li>
<li>Item Categories</li>
<li>Schedule Lines Categories</li>
<li>Copy Control</li>
<li>Log of Incomplete Items</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to process sales orders in SAP SD.</p>
<h2>Sales Order Processing</h2>
<p>Sales order processing describes a function related to the wholesale part of an organizational business.</p>
<p>The most common functions under the sales order processing are &minus;</p> 
<ul class="list">
<li>Availability of the articles purchased.</li>
<li>Checking for incomplete data.</li>
<li>Checking the status of the sales transaction.</li>
<li>Calculation of pricing and taxes.</li>
<li>Schedule the deliveries of goods.</li>
<li>Printing of documents or e-transfer of documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these functions can be configured automatically or manually as per the system configuration. The data from these functions is stored in a sales document and can be changed manually during the processing. A sales document can be a single document or can be part of a series consisting of interrelated documents.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>There is a customer telephone inquiry in the system. Then the customer requests a quotation, which can be created by referring to the same inquiry. Next, assume that the customer places an order on the basis of that quotation and a sales order is created by copying the information from this quotation and if at all there are any modifications that are required. The merchandise is then shipped and the bill is sent to this customer. After the delivery of goods, this customer raises a claim of damaged articles. Then a delivery can be created free of charge with reference to the sales order.</p>
<p>All these sales documents &minus; starting with the inquiry, quotation, raising a sales order, delivery of goods, billing document to customer and the free of charge delivery forms a document flow. The data flow from one document to another removes or decreases the practice of manual processing and helps in simpler problem resolution.</p>
<h1>SAP SD - Creation of Sales Order</h1>
<p>A Sales order is a request made by a customer to the company for delivery of some defined quantity of goods or a service in a specific time period.</p>
<h2>The Structure of a Sales Order</h2>
<p>An inquiry from a customer consists of one or more items that contains the quantity of a material or service entered in the order. The quantity in a sales order is further divided into business lines and comprises of various subsets and delivering dates. The items mentioned in the Sales order are combined in a hierarchy and allows to differentiate between batches or to use combinations of materials. All the valid conditions on these items are mentioned in item conditions. These conditions for an item can be derived via a full condition and can be valid for the entire sales order.</p>
<p>You can divide an item to multiple billing plan deadlines and each of them will tell you the time, when a fixed amount of the item is to be billed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>VA02</b> &minus; Edit a Sales Order.</p></li>

<h1>SAP SD - Item Categories</h1>
<p>An item category is used to define if an item is suitable for billing or pricing. It defines the additional control functions for a sales document.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; A standard item function is totally different from the function of a free of charge item or a text item.</p>
<p>As per the sales document type, you can define different types of item categories. If required, you can also modify the existing item categories or can also define new item categories. An item category can be defined on the basis of the following questions &minus;</p>
<h2>General Data Control Elements</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An item refers to a material or a text item?</p></li>
<li><p>Whether pricing has to be carried out for an item?</p></li>

<h1>SAP SD - Schedule Lines Categories</h1>
<p>In a sales document, items are divided into one or more schedule lines. These lines vary as per the date and quantity. You can define multiple control elements for these schedule lines. Items with schedule lines are only copied to the SAP system. These schedule lines contain important information like delivery dates and quantity, available inventory, etc.</p>
<p>You can define different schedule line categories as per the sales document type and item category. The various <b>control elements</b> related to general data and shipping data are used for categorizing schedule lines. You can also define new schedule lines and the system administrator manages data related to control elements.</p>
<h2>General Data Control Elements</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>If an availability check is carried out in system?</li>
<li>Is it a schedule line for a return item?</li>
<li>Whether a customer request is posted to purchase department?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shipping Data Control Elements</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>If a delivery block is set automatically for a defined schedule line?</li>
<li>Is the schedule line relevant for delivery?</li>
</ul>
<p>The categorization of schedule line majorly varies as per the item category of a corresponding item and the material requirement planning MRP. This is defined in the material master record. The categories for a schedule line are defined automatically as per their values in the corresponding table. In case if it is required, you can do some manual changes to the values in the sales document, but can’t change all the values.</p>
<h2>How to Define Schedule Line Categories?</h2>
<p>It can be defined in the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can copy an existing schedule line category and make changes as per the requirement.</p></li>

<h1>SAP SD - Copy Control</h1>
<p>Copy Control is defined as a process in which important transactions in a sales document are copied from one document to other. It consists of routines, which determine the system on how the data is to be copied from a source document to a target document. A SAP system contains a number of these routines and you can also create additional routines to meet the business requirements. To create a new routine, you can use an existing sales document as a reference.</p>
<h2>How to find Copy Controls in SAP system?</h2>
<p>These controls are created and configured under IMG and can be found at the following menu path &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Sales and Distribution &rarr; Sales &rarr; Maintain copy control for sales documents.</p></li>
<li><p>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Sales and Distribution &rarr; Shipping &rarr; Specify copy control for deliveries.</p></li>
<li><p>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Sales and Distribution &rarr; Billing &rarr; Billing Documents &rarr; Maintain copy control for billing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the following T-Codes to find copy controls in a system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>VTAA</b> &minus; This control is used for copying from sales order to sales order</p></li>
<li><p><b>VTLA</b> &minus; This control is used control for copying from sales order to delivery</p></li>
<li><p><b>VTFL</b> &minus; This control is used control for copying from delivery to billing doc</p></li>
<li><p><b>VTFF</b> &minus; This control is used control for copying from billing doc to billing doc</p></li>
<li><p><b>VTAF</b> &minus; This control is used control for copying from billing doc to sales order</p></li>
<li><p><b>VTFA</b> &minus; This control is used control for copying from sales order to billing doc</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How Copy Controls work in SAP system?</h2>
<p>You can setup Copy controls in a system at three different levels in a Sales Order &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Header level.</p></li>
<li><p>Item level.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule line level (Only relevant, when you copy from a sales order to sales order or from billing doc to sales order).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Header Copy Control routine is required when you copy data from header of a source document to the header of a target document.</p>
<p><b>T-Code:</b> VTLA to check copy control between sales order and delivery.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/display_view_header.jpg" alt="Display View Header" />
<p>You can check the source of a routing by selecting the routine and press F4. To open it in the ABAP editor, you can press F5. Copy controls for an item can be checked by a double click on the item folder and choosing an item category and then clicking on the Display view item overview screen. You can then use the F1 key to find out how each routine is employed. The target documents will be assigned an updated reference status in the copied item.</p>
<p>The following types of status can be possible for an item &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Not relevant</b> &minus; it tells if an item is not relevant for copying.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Not referenced</b> &minus; it tells an item has not been copied.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Partially referenced</b> &minus; it tells if an item quantity is fully copied.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fully referenced</b> &minus; It tells if an entire item quantity has been copied or not and an item cannot be referenced further.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also display reference status for a copy control &minus;</p>
<p>Select the Header &rarr; Status for the status of the entire document. This field is used &minus; Field VBUK-RFSTK.</p>
<p>Select an Item &rarr; To find the status of the line item. This field is used &minus; VBUP-RFSTA.</p>
<h1>SAP SD - Log of INComplete Items</h1>
<p>You can also define a sales activity or a sales document as incomplete. How the system behaves when you create such document in system is shown below.</p>
<p>The following entries can be made to the system for incomplete data &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Header Data of a Sales document</li>
<li>Item Data of a Sales Document</li>

<h1>SAP SD - Pricing</h1>
<p>Pricing in Sales and Distribution is used to define the calculation of prices for external vendors or customers and cost. This condition is defined as a set of conditions when a price is calculated.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider a case when customer orders specific quantity of a product on a particular day. Various factors like customer, product, order quantity and date tells the final price to that customer. This information is stored in the system as master data in the form of condition records.</p>
<p>There are various pricing elements like prices, surcharges, discounts, and taxes, which are defined in SAP system as condition types. To manage pricing information for a pricing element in a system, you have to create condition records.</p>
<h2>Manual Pricing</h2>
<p>While processing a sales order, you can also manipulate the pricing at the item as well as the header level. Manual processing of a price screen is dependent on individual condition types. During a Sales Order processing using manual processing for a condition type, you can perform the below activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Deleting the pricing element.</li>
<li>Changing a condition amount.</li>
<li>Entering additional pricing elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to add Pricing elements manually?</h3>
<p>If you want to add customer discount manually in the pricing screen of a sales order, click on Add line. In Data screen, you can enter additional conditions like – customer discount in the condition type field. Enter a percentage range and then press ENTER. You can also delete pricing elements in item pricing and header screens. To do this, select the particular condition by positioning the cursor and click on delete line.</p>
<p>Note that all header conditions defined at header level cannot be changed at the item level, and conditions defined at this level cannot be changed at the header level. Only the Conditions that you define at both header and item conditions can only be edited at both levels.</p>
<h1>SAP SD - Condition Record &amp; Table</h1>
<p>A Condition table is defined as a combination of keys to identify an individual condition record. A condition record is defined as how system stores the specific condition.</p>
<p><b>Example of a Condition Record</b> &minus; Entering the price of a product or to specify the discount for a privileged customer.</p>
<p><b>Example of a Condition Table</b> &minus; Condition records for a customer specific material prices are stored by a sales department. SAP system contains a conditional table 005 for this purpose. Key of table 005 includes the following field &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Customer</li>
<li>Material</li>
<li>Sales Organization</li>
<li>Distribution Channel</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first two fields, the customer and material determines the relationship between customers and specific materials. The last two fields are used to identify organization data in a SAP system. Now, if sales department in an organization enters a condition record for discount to one privileged customer, the system will automatically make use of the condition table 005 to store the record and define a key. Any standard SAP system contains predefined condition tables and specifies for each access in a predefined access sequence.</p>
<h2>Creating Condition Tables</h2>
<p>In a SAP system, you can create or change existing condition tables. As per the new business requirement in an organization, you can create new condition tables.</p>
<p>Go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Sales and Distribution &rarr; Basic Functions &rarr; Pricing &rarr; Pricing Control &rarr; Define Conditional Tables</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/condition_tables.jpg" alt="Condition Tables" />
<p>A new window will open and then you can select from create, change or display field as per the requirement. To create a new table, you have to select create and click on Choose.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/activity.jpg" alt="Choose Activity" />
<p>Enter condition table in table field and then you can enter the existing table to copy the condition.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/sales_distribution_pricing.jpg" alt="Pricing sales/distribution" />
<p>Once data is copied, you can modify the table as per the business requirement.</p>
<h1>SAP SD - Condition Techniques &amp; Types</h1>
<p>Condition type is defined as specific features of daily pricing activities in a SAP system. Using the condition type, you can also put different condition types for each pricing, discounts on goods, tax and surcharge that occurs in business transactions.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Condition type allows you to define the discount for special material. This can be specified in the system to calculate discount as an amount or it can calculate discount in terms of percentage. In case you have to use both discount types, two separate condition types have to be defined in the system.</p>
<p>There are predefined condition types in a standard system &minus;</p>

<h1>SAP SD - Prices, Surcharges &amp; Discounts</h1>
<h2>Prices and Types</h2>
<p>In a standard SAP system, price is defined as gross price of a material. Below are the predefined price types in a system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Material Price</li>
<li>Price List Type</li>
<li>Customer specific price</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the system takes gross price in the automatic pricing for a business transaction. In a standard SAP system, system takes customer specific price. If no such price exists, system checks for a valid price list type. If this is also not present in the system, it takes the material price.</p>
<h3>Material Prices</h3>
<p>When material price is created, it means – the price for a specific material or pricing for a specific material type. A combination of sales organization and distribution channel for which material price is valid.</p>
<h3>Price List Types</h3>
<p>As per your business requirement in an organization, you can define your own price list.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; Price list can be created as per the customer type like Retail, Wholesale customer and so on. Price list can also be created as per currency type.</p>
<p><b>Customer Specific Prices</b> &minus; You can also create pricing records for specific customers. You can assign pricing record for specific combination of customers and material type.</p>
<h2>Surcharges and Discounts</h2>
<p>A standard SAP system includes a variety of common discount types. You can also define or customize discounts and surcharges as per the business requirement.</p>
<p>A Standard SAP system includes the below mentioned discount types &minus; </p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

</table>
<p>While creating a condition record, you can use any of above standard discount types. While doing automatic pricing, system checks for the discount that satisfies a certain condition and it checks for a valid condition record.

<h1>SAP SD - Quota Arrangement</h1>
<p>A particular material can be procured from different vendors depending on the customer requirement. So, the total requirement of a material is distributed to different vendor’s i.e. quota is assigned to each source of supply. This is known as quota arrangement.</p>
<p>The key points about quota arrangement are as follows &minus;</p>
<p>Quota arrangement divides the total requirement of material among certain sources of supply, i.e. vendors and then assigns quota to each source. This particular quota specifies the portion of material that is to be procured from this assigned vendor or source. Quota rating is used to determine the amount of material that is to be assigned to a particular source or vendor. The source with lowest quota rating represents the valid source.</p>
<p>Quota rating can be calculated by the following formula &minus;</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Quota rating = (Quota Allocated Quantity &plus; Quota Base Quantity)/Quota</p>
<p>Where the Quota Allocated Quantity is the total quantity from all orders that are procured from a particular source. Quota Base Quantity is the quantity from a new source of supply. Quota is the total requirement of material that is given to a particular source of supply.</p>
<p>The mandatory setting before creating quota is – information record and source list should be maintained for the particular material. Also, in the material master, the source list and quota arrangement usage check box should be checked. This setting can be made in the material master by going to <b>T-Code MM03</b>. In the purchasing view, check the quota arrangement usage and source list. Setting is now maintained for quota arrangement.</p>

<h1>SAP SD - Billing Methods</h1>
<p>A billing method determines whether you have to create an invoice for every delivery or you want to send an invoice to the customer each month.</p>
<p>You can use the following billing method types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Individual Billing per sales document.</li>
<li>Collective Billing method for multiple sales document.</li>
<li>Invoice Split for several billing documents for one or more sales document.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Individual Billing method, you can make the setting in system to create single billing document for each sales document. Example: One invoice per delivery.</p>
<p>In Collective Billing, it allows you to combine different documents like sales orders and/or deliveries either partially or fully in a common billing document.</p>
<p>Invoice Splits allow you to create invoices as per the specific criteria.</p>
<h2>Billing Plan</h2>
<p>A billing plan in SAP SD is defined as a plan with individual billing dates for goods and services and it doesn’t depend on the delivery of goods. Using this bill plan, you can bill for a service or product at regular time intervals or at specific dates defined in the system in advance.</p>
<p>As per the business transactions, a system allows you to process any of the billing plan type. There are two types of billing plan &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Milestone Billing</li>
<li>Periodic Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>Milestone billing includes dividing the total billed amount in multiple billing dates that are defined in a billing plan. When there is a milestone reached as per defined in the system, customer is charged as per the project cost or a predefined amount as per the bill plan. Milestone billing is normally used for long term projects.</p>
<p>Periodic billing includes charging of bill amount at a regular interval of time. Example: Suppose you have to pay a rental amount monthly as per the contract. The system can process monthly payment as per the schedule. Periodic billing plan is normally used in the following categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>For a Service like Annual Maintenance contracts, etc.</li>
<li>For lease agreements.</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Management.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assigning Billing Plans to Business Transactions</h3>
<p>In SAP system, you can mention if one billing plan is applicable for all the products in a business transaction or you can define separate bill plans for each transaction goods as per the requirement.</p>
<p>Note that you can define a billing plan in SAP CRM system &minus; Customer Relationship Management &rarr; Transactions &rarr; Basic Settings &rarr; Billing Plan</p>
<p>You cannot use billing plans created in SAP CRM system in SAP ERP system.</p>
<h3>Revenue Account Determination</h3>
<p>Revenue account is used for revenue recognition and is used for integrating SAP SD module and Finance Accounting module. As per the billing document to account, system determines the correct G/L account for posting the revenue as per the revenue account determination.</p>
<p>To configure Revenue Account Determination: Use <b>T-Code: OVK5</b></p> 
<p>OR</p>
<p>Go to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Sales and Distribution &rarr; Basic Function &rarr; Account Assignment/Costing &rarr; Revenue Account Determination &rarr; Check Master data relevant for Determination.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/revenue_account_determination.jpg" alt="Revenue Account Determination" />
<p>Using this, you can define &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Account Assignment for Materials</li>
<li>Account Assignment for Customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Select any one of them and click <b>Choose</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/account_assignment.jpg" alt="Account Assignment" />
<p><b>Materials</b> &minus; Account Assignment Groups &minus; Using this option, you can divide materials into different groups, services and retails groups. You maintain this in Material Master MM01/MM02 under Sales &rarr; Sales Org 2 view.</p>
<p><b>Customers</b> &minus; Account Assignment Groups &minus; Using this option, you can divide customer into different groups. Example: You can divide customers into domestic customers and non-domestic or overseas. You maintain this in Payer Customer Master using VD01/XD01/VD02/XD02 under billing document tab of Sales Area Data.</p>

<h1>SAP SD - Credit Management</h1>
<p>Credit management deals with selling of goods and collecting money at a later stage. The credit limit for a customer depends on the payment method and customer payment history. The payment for the goods is based on payment conditions based on the business transaction.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>A customer’s credit limit is set as 10000 and he makes an order worth 6000 and payment term of 30 days at 4%. Now if payment is made within 30 days, customer will get 4% discount on the payment.</p>
<p>Why do we need Credit Management?</p>
<p>Credit management allows you to reduce the credit risk by setting up the credit limit for the customers. You can get warning alerts for a customer or a group of customers.</p>
<h2>Key Features of Credit Management</h2>
<p>As per your credit needs, you can define your various credit policies as per different criteria. This also allows you to define key points in Sales and Distribution system, where the system checks are performed.</p>
<p>While processing an order, the system allows a representative to get the information about customer’s credit details. When a customer is about to reach his credit limit. An electronic email can be sent to the customer automatically. The credit representative in your company has an option to review the credit situation of a customer quickly and accurately and to decide if to extend the credit limit or not.</p>
<h3>Types of Credit Management</h3>
<p>There are two types of credit management &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Simple Credit Check</li>
<li>Automatic Credit Check</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple credit check involves comparing customer credit limit to the total of all items and open item values in the order.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Credit Limit = Open item values &plus; Value of current Sales Order</p>
<p>Open items are defined as the products that are invoiced to the customer, but payment has not been received yet. You can configure the system in such a way that it sends a warning message to the customer, when their credit limit is exceeded.</p>
<p>Automatic Credit Check involves checking open items and open deliveries of goods as well. If the credit limit is crossed, a customer can still make the order because of a good payment history with the company. This can be defined as &minus; Static and dynamic credit check.</p>
<h3>Static Credit Limit Determination</h3>
<p>Types of checking groups &minus; Sales, Delivery and Good Issue. You can block the order at all these levels.</p>
<p><b>Risk Category</b> &minus; It is used to determine how much credit has to be given to the customer.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>High Risk</b> &minus; Low Credit</p></li>
<li><p><b>Low Risk</b> &minus; More Credit</p></li>
<li><p><b>Medium Risk</b> &minus; Average Credit</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Dynamic Credit Limit Determination</h3>
<p>It is used to determine the credit limit of their customer by considering a horizon period &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Open Document</li>
<li>Open Deliveries</li>
<li>Open Billings</li>
<li>Open Items</li>
<li>Horizon Period</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if the horizon period is defined as 4 months, the system will not consider these documents for 4 months.</p>
<h3>Assigning Company Code to Credit Control Area</h3>
<p>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Enterprise Structure &rarr; Assignment &rarr; Financial Accounting &rarr; Assign company code to credit control area</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/credit_control_area.jpg" alt="Credit Control Area" />
<p>A new window will open, then you can set the automatic credit check.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/company_code.jpg" alt="Company Code" />
<h3>Defining Credit Groups</h3>
<p>Go to: SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Sales and Distribution &rarr; Basic Functions &rarr; Credit Management/Risk Management &rarr; Define Credit Groups</p>
<p>The following credit groups are defined in a SAP system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Credit group for sales order</li>
<li>Credit group for deliveries</li>
<li>Credit Group for goods issue</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_sd/images/credit_groups.jpg" alt="Credit Groups" />
<h1>SAP SD - Mapping Enterprise Structure</h1>
<p>The enterprise structure represents the business structure in the real world.
