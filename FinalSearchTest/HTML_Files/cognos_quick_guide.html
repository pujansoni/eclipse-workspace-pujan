<h1>Data Warehouse - Overview</h1>
<p>A Data Warehouse consists of data from <b>multiple heterogeneous data sources</b> and is used for analytical reporting and decision making. Data Warehouse is a central place where data is stored from different data sources and applications.</p>
<p>The term Data Warehouse was first invented by Bill Inmom in 1990. A Data Warehouse is always kept separate from an Operational Database.</p>
<p>The data in a DW system is loaded from operational transaction systems like &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>HR</li>
<li>SCM, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may pass through operational data store or other transformations before it is loaded to the DW system for information processing.</p>
<p>A Data Warehouse is used for reporting and analyzing of information and stores both historical and current data. The data in DW system is used for Analytical reporting, which is later used by Business Analysts, Sales Managers or Knowledge workers for decision-making.</p>
<img src="images/data_warehouse.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse" />
<p>In the above image, you can see that the data is coming from <b>multiple heterogeneous data</b> sources to a Data Warehouse. Common data sources for a data warehouse includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Operational databases</li>
<li>SAP and non-SAP Applications</li>
<li>Flat Files (xls, csv, txt files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data in data warehouse is accessed by BI (Business Intelligence) users for Analytical Reporting, Data Mining and Analysis. This is used for decision making by Business Users, Sales Manager, Analysts to define future strategy.</p>
<h2>Features of a Data Warehouse</h2>
<p>It is a central data repository where data is stored from one or more heterogeneous data sources. A DW system stores both current and historical data. Normally a DW system stores 5-10 years of historical data. A DW system is always kept separate from an operational transaction system.</p>
<p>The data in a DW system is used for different types of analytical reporting range from Quarterly to Annual comparison.</p>
<h3>Data Warehouse Vs Operational Database</h3>
<p>The differences between a Data Warehouse and Operational Database are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An <b>Operational System</b> is designed for known workloads and transactions like updating a user record, searching a record, etc. However, Data Warehouse transactions are more complex and present a general form of data.</p></li>
<li><p>An <b>Operational System</b> contains the current data of an organization and Data warehouse normally contains the historical data.</p></li>
<li><p>An <b>Operational Database</b> supports parallel processing of multiple transactions. Concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are required to maintain consistency of the database.</p></li>
<li><p>An <b>Operational Database</b> query allows to read and modify operations (insert, delete and Update) while an OLAP query needs only read-only access of stored data (Select statement).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Architecture of Data Warehouse</h2>
<p>Data Warehousing involves data cleaning, data integration, and data consolidations. A Data Warehouse has a 3-layer architecture &minus;</p>
<h3>Data Source Layer</h3>
<p>It defines how the data comes to a Data Warehouse. It involves various data sources and operational transaction systems, flat files, applications, etc.</p>
<h3>Integration Layer</h3>
<p>It consists of Operational Data Store and Staging area. Staging area is used to perform data cleansing, data transformation and loading data from different sources to a data warehouse. As multiple data sources are available for extraction at different time zones, staging area is used to store the data and later to apply transformations on data.</p>
<h3>Presentation Layer</h3>
<p>This is used to perform BI reporting by end users. The data in a DW system is accessed by BI users and used for reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the common architecture of a Data Warehouse System.</p>
<img src="images/data_warehouse_architecture.jpg" alt="Data Warehouse Architecture" />
<h2>Characteristics of a Data Warehouse</h2>
<p>The following are the key characteristics of a Data Warehouse &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Subject Oriented</b> &minus; In a DW system, the data is categorized and stored by a business subject rather than by application like equity plans, shares, loans, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integrated</b> &minus; Data from multiple data sources are integrated in a Data Warehouse.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Non Volatile</b> &minus; Data in data warehouse is non-volatile. It means when data is loaded in DW system, it is not altered.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Time Variant</b> &minus; A DW system contains historical data as compared to Transactional system which contains only current data. In a Data warehouse you can see data for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>OLTP vs OLAP</h2>
<p>Firstly, OLTP stands for <b>Online Transaction Processing</b>, while OLAP stands for <b>Online Analytical Processing</b></p>
<p>In an OLTP system, there are a large number of short online transactions such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.</p>
<p>Whereas, in an OLTP system, an effective measure is the processing time of short transactions and is very less. It controls data integrity in multi-access environments. For an OLTP system, the number of transactions per second measures the effectiveness. An OLTP Data Warehouse System contains current and detailed data and is maintained in the schemas in the entity model (3NF).</p>
<p><b>For Example</b> &minus;</p>
<p>A Day-to-Day transaction system in a retail store, where the customer records are inserted, updated and deleted on a daily basis. It provides faster query processing. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store OLTP database is the Entity model.</p>
<p>In an OLAP system, there are lesser number of transactions as compared to a transactional system. The queries executed are complex in nature and involves data aggregations.</p>
<h3>What is an Aggregation?</h3>
<p>We save tables with aggregated data like yearly (1 row), quarterly (4 rows), monthly (12 rows) or so, if someone has to do a year to year comparison, only one row will be processed. However, in an un-aggregated table it will compare all the rows. This is called Aggregation.</p>
<p>There are various Aggregation functions that can be used in an OLAP system like Sum, Avg, Max, Min, etc.</p>
<p><b>For Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SELECT Avg(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE title = 'Programmer';
</pre>
<h3>Key Differences</h3>
<p>These are the major differences between an OLAP and an OLTP system.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Indexes</b> &minus; An OLTP system has only few indexes while in an OLAP system there are many indexes for performance optimization.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Joins</b> &minus; In an OLTP system, large number of joins and data are normalized. However, in an OLAP system there are less joins and are de-normalized.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Aggregation</b> &minus; In an OLTP system, data is not aggregated while in an OLAP database more aggregations are used.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Normalization</b> &minus; An OLTP system contains normalized data however data is not normalized in an OLAP system.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/oltp.jpg" alt="OLTP" />
<h2>Data Mart Vs Data Warehouse</h2>
<p>Data mart focuses on a single functional area and represents the simplest form of a Data Warehouse. Consider a Data Warehouse that contains data for Sales, Marketing, HR, and Finance. A Data mart focuses on a single functional area like Sales or Marketing.</p>
<img src="images/data_mart_vs_data_warehouse.jpg" alt="Data Mart Vs Data Warehouse" />
<p>In the above image, you can see the difference between a Data Warehouse and a data mart.</p>
<h2>Fact vs Dimension Table</h2>
<p>A fact table represents the measures on which analysis is performed. It also contains foreign keys for the dimension keys.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Every sale is a fact.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Cust Id</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Prod Id</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Time Id</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Qty Sold</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1110</td>
<td>25</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>125</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1210</td>
<td>28</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>252</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The Dimension table represents the characteristics of a dimension. A Customer dimension can have Customer_Name, Phone_No, Sex, etc.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Cust Id</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Cust_Name</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Phone</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Sex</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1110</td>
<td>Sally</td>
<td>1113334444</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1210</td>
<td>Adam</td>
<td>2225556666</td>
<td>M</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h1>Data Warehouse - Schemas</h1>
<p>A schema is defined as a logical description of database where fact and dimension tables are joined in a logical manner. Data Warehouse is maintained in the form of Star, Snow flakes, and Fact Constellation schema.</p>
<h2>Star Schema</h2>
<p>A Star schema contains a fact table and multiple dimension tables. Each dimension is represented with only one-dimension table and they are not normalized. The Dimension table contains a set of attributes.</p>
<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>In a Star schema, there is only one fact table and multiple dimension tables.</li>
<li>In a Star schema, each dimension is represented by one-dimension table.</li>
<li>Dimension tables are not normalized in a Star schema.</li>
<li>Each Dimension table is joined to a key in a fact table.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows the sales data of a company with respect to the four dimensions, namely Time, Item, Branch, and Location.</p>
<img src="images/star_schema.jpg" alt="Star Schema" />
<p>There is a fact table at the center. It contains the keys to each of four dimensions. The fact table also contains the attributes, namely dollars sold and units sold.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Each dimension has only one-dimension table and each table holds a set of attributes. For example, the location dimension table contains the attribute set {location_key, street, city, province_or_state, country}. This constraint may cause data redundancy.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; "Vancouver" and "Victoria" both the cities are in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The entries for such cities may cause data redundancy along the attributes province_or_state and country.</p>
<h2>Snowflakes Schema</h2>
<p>Some dimension tables in the Snowflake schema are normalized. The normalization splits up the data into additional tables as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<img src="images/snowflakes_schema.jpg" alt="Snowflakes Schema" />
<p>Unlike in the Star schema, the dimension’s table in a snowflake schema are normalized.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; The item dimension table in a star schema is normalized and split into two dimension tables, namely item and supplier table. Now the item dimension table contains the attributes item_key, item_name, type, brand, and supplier-key.</p>
<p>The supplier key is linked to the supplier dimension table. The supplier dimension table contains the attributes supplier_key and supplier_type.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Due to the normalization in the Snowflake schema, the redundancy is reduced and therefore, it becomes easy to maintain and the save storage space.</p>
<h2>Fact Constellation Schema (Galaxy Schema)</h2>
<p>A fact constellation has multiple fact tables. It is also known as a Galaxy Schema.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows two fact tables, namely Sales and Shipping &minus;</p>
<img src="images/galaxy_schema.jpg" alt="Galaxy Schema" />
<p>The sales fact table is the same as that in the Star Schema. The shipping fact table has five dimensions, namely item_key, time_key, shipper_key, from_location, to_location. The shipping fact table also contains two measures, namely dollars sold and units sold. It is also possible to share dimension tables between fact tables.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Time, item, and location dimension tables are shared between the sales and shipping fact table.</p>

<p>An ETL tool extracts the data from all these heterogeneous data sources, transforms the data (like applying calculations, joining fields, keys, removing incorrect data fields, etc.), and loads it into a Data Warehouse.</p>
<h2>Extraction</h2>
<p>A staging area is required during the ETL load. There are various reasons why staging area is required. The source systems are only available for specific period of time to extract data. This period of time is less than the total data-load time. Therefore, staging area allows you to extract the data from the source system and keeps it in the staging area before the time slot ends.</p>
<p>The staging area is required when you want to get the data from multiple data sources together or if you want to join two or more systems together.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; You will not be able to perform an SQL Query joining two tables from two physically different databases.</p>
<p>The data extractions’ time slot for different systems vary as per the time zone and operational hours. The data extracted from the source systems can be used in multiple Data Warehouse Systems, Operation Data Stores, etc.</p>
<p>ETL allows you to perform complex transformations and requires extra area to store the data.</p>
<img src="images/extraction.jpg" alt="Extraction" />
<h2>Transform</h2>
<p>In data transformation, you apply a set of functions on extracted data to load it into the target system. The data that does not require any transformation is known as a direct move or pass through data.</p>
<p>You can apply different transformations on extracted data from the source system. For example, you can perform customized calculations. If you want sum-of-sales revenue and this is not in database, you can apply the SUM formula during transformation and load the data.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; If you have the first name and the last name in a table in different columns, you can use concatenate before loading.</p>
<h2>Load</h2>
<p>During the Load phase, data is loaded into the end-target system and it can be a flat file or a Data Warehouse system.</p>
<h2>BI Reporting Tool</h2>
<p>BI (Business Intelligence) tools are used by business users to create basic, medium, and complex reports from the transactional data in data warehouse and by creating Universes using the <b>Information Design Tool/UDT</b>. Various SAP and non-SAP data sources can be used to create reports.</p>
<p>There are quite a few BI Reporting, Dashboard and Data Visualization Tools available in the market. Some of which are as follows &minus; </p>

<p>Cognos also provides you an option to export the report in XML or PDF format or you can view the reports in XML format. You can also schedule the report to run in the background at specific time period so it saves the time to view the daily report as you don’t need to run the report every time.</p>
<p>IBM Cognos provides a wide range of features and can be considered as an enterprise software to provide flexible reporting environment and <b>can be used for large and medium enterprises</b>. It meets the need of Power Users, Analysts, Business Managers and Company Executives. Power users and analysts want to create adhoc reports and can create multiple views of the same data. Business Executives want to see summarize data in dashboard styles, cross tabs and visualizations. Cognos allows both the options for all set of users.</p>
<h2>Key Features of IBM Cognos</h2>
<p>Cognos BI reporting allows you to bring the data from multiple databases into a single set of reports. IBM Cognos provides wide range of features as compared to other BI tools in the market. You can create and schedule the reports and complex report can be designed easily in the Cognos BI Reporting Tool.</p>
<p>The Cognos BI Reporting Tool allows to create a report for a set of users like – Power users, Analysts, and Business Executives, etc. IBM Cognos can handle a large volume of data and is suitable for medium and large enterprises to fulfil BI needs.</p>
<h3>3-Tier Architecture Cognos</h3>
<p>Cognos BI is considered to be a 3-tier architecture layout. At the top, there is a Web Client or a Web Server. The 2<sup>nd</sup> tier consists of a Web Application Server. While the bottom tier consists of a Data layer.</p>
<p>These tiers are separated by firewalls and communication between these tiers happens using SOAP and HTTP protocols.</p>
<img src="images/3_tier_architecture_cognos.jpg" alt="3-Tier Architecture Cognos" />
<h3>Tier-1 Web Clients</h3>
<p>The web client allows BI users to access TM1 data and interact with data in any of the supported browsers. Tier 1 is responsible to manage the gateway and is used for encryption and decryption of passwords, extract information needed to submit a request to the BI server, authentication of server and to pass the request to Cognos BI dispatcher for processing.</p>
<h3>Tier-2 Web Application Server</h3>
<p>This tier hosts the Cognos BI server and its associated services. Application server contains Application Tier Components, Content Manager and Bootstrap service.</p>
<p>Cognos TM1 Web Application Server runs on Java based Apache Tomcat server. Using this tier, Microsoft Excel worksheets can be converted to TM1 Web sheets and also allows to export web sheets back to Excel and PDF format.</p>
<h3>Tier-3 Data</h3>
<p>This tier contains content and data sources. It contains TM1 Admin server and at least one TM1 server.</p>
<p>TM1 Admin server can be installed on any computer on your LAN and it must reside on same network as TM1 server. The version of TM1 server should be equal or most recent then the version of Cognos TM1 web.</p>

<p>There are various other BI reporting tools in the market that are used in medium and large enterprise for analytics and reporting purpose. Some of them are described here along with its key features.</p>
<h3>Cognos vs Microsoft BI (Source: www.trustradius.com)</h3>
<p>Following are the key features that are supported by both the tools &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Standard Reporting</li>
<li>Ad-hoc Reporting</li>
<li>Report output and Scheduling</li>
<li>Data Discovery and Visualization</li>
<li>Access Control and Security</li>
<li>Mobile Capabilities</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/ibm_cognos.jpg" alt="IBM Cognos" />
<p>Cognos can be considered as a robust solution which allows you to create a variety of reports like Cross tabs, Active reports (latest feature in Cognos 10), and other report structure. You can create user prompts, scheduling of report is easy and you can export and view reports in different formats. The Microsoft BI provides easy visualization of business data as well as Easy integration with Microsoft Excel.</p>
<h2>IBM Cognos vs SAP Business Objects</h2>
<p>SAP BO supports its own ETL tool SAP Data Services. IBM Cognos doesn’t support its own ETL tool. The IBM Cognos 8 doesn’t provide offline reporting features however it is there in SAP Business Objects reporting tools.</p>
<p>In Cognos the entire functionality is divided into multiple tools Query studio, Analysis studio, event studio etc. It is a tough task to learn all the tools. In SAP Business Objects, you have multiple tools like Web Intelligence for reporting, IDT for Universe Designer, Dashboard Designer so users feel that it is a tough task to manage and learn all the tools.</p>
<p>In IBM Cognos, data generated can be transformed in various formats (for instance, HTML, PDF, etc.) and can also be accessed from multiple locations (e-mail, mobile, office, etc.). IBM provides several planning capabilities such as forecasts, budgets, advance scenario modelling etc. Selection of BI tool depends on various factors like need of company, software version, features supported and the license cost.</p>
<h1>Cognos - Components and Services</h1>
<p>There are various components in Cognos that communicate with each other using BI Bus and are known as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and supports WSDL. BI Bus in Cognos architecture is not a software component but consists of a set of protocols that allows communication between Cognos Services.</p>
<p>The processes enabled by the BI Bus protocol includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Messaging and dispatching</li>
<li>Log message processing</li>
<li>Database connection management</li>
<li>Microsoft .NET Framework interactions</li>
<li>Port usage</li>
<li>Request flow processing</li>
<li>Portal Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>When you install Cognos 8 using the Installation wizard, you specify where to install each of these components &minus;</p>
<h2>Gateways</h2>
<p>The Cognos 8 Web server tier contains one or more Cognos 8 gateways. The web communication in Cognos 8 is typically through gateways, which reside on one or more web servers. A gateway is an extension of a web server program that transfers information from the web server to another server. Web communication can also occur directly with a Cognos 8 dispatcher but this option is less common.</p>
<p>Cognos 8 supports several types of Web gateways, including &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><b>CGI</b> &minus; The default gateway, CGI can be used for all supported Web servers. However, for enhanced performance or throughput, you may choose one of the other supported gateway types.</li>
<li><b>ISAPI</b> &minus; This can be used for the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server. It delivers faster performance for IIS.</li>
<li><b>apache_mod</b> &minus; You can use an apache_mod gateway with the Apache Web server.</li>
<li><b>Servlet</b> &minus; If your Web server infrastructure supports servlets or you are using an application server, you can use a servlet gateway.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application Tier Components</h2>
<p>This component consists of a dispatcher that is responsible to operate services and route requests. The dispatcher is a multithreaded application that uses one or more threads per request. The configuration changes are routinely communicated to all the running dispatchers. This dispatcher includes Cognos Application Firewall to provide security for Cognos 8.</p>
<p>The dispatcher can route requests to a local service, such as the report service, presentation service, job service, or monitor service. A dispatcher can also route requests to a specific dispatcher to run a given request. These requests can be routed to specific dispatchers based on load-balancing needs, or package or user group requirements.</p>
<h2>Content Manager</h2>
<p>Content Manager contains Access Manager, the primary security component of Cognos 8. Access Manager leverages your existing security providers for use with Cognos 8. It provides Cognos 8 with a consistent set of security capabilities and APIs, including user authentication, authorization, and encryption. It also provides support for the Cognos namespace.</p>
<h1>Cognos - Connections</h1>
<p>You can report interactive user reports in Cognos Studio on the top of various data sources by creating relational and OLAP connections in web administration interface which are later used for data modeling in Framework Manager known as packages. All the reports and dashboards that are created in Cognos Studio they are published to Cognos Connection and portal for distribution. The report studio can be used to run the complex report and to view the Business Intelligence information or this can also be accessed from different portals where they are published.</p>
<p>Cognos Connections are used to access reports, queries, analysis, and packages. They can also be used to create report shortcuts, URLs and pages and to organize entries and they can also be customized for other use.</p>
<img src="images/connections.jpg" alt="Connections" />
<h2>Connecting Different Data Sources</h2>
<p>A data source defines the physical connection to a database and different connection parameters like connection time out, location of database, etc. A data source connection contains credential and sign on information. You can create a new database connection or can also edit an existing data source connection.</p>
<p>You can also combine one or more data source connections and create packages and published them using Framework manager.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Query Mode</h3>
<p>The dynamic query mode is used to provide communication to data source using XMLA/Java connections. To connect to the Relation database, you can use type4 JDBC connection which converts JDBC calls into vendor specific format. It provides improved performance over type 2 drivers because there is no need to convert calls to ODBC or database API. Dynamic query mode in Cognos connection can support the following types of Relational databases &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>IBM DB2</li>
<li>Teradata</li>
<li>Netezza</li>
</ul>
<p>To support OLAP data sources, Java/XMLA connectivity provides optimized and enhanced MDX for different OLAP versions and technology. The Dynamic query mode in Cognos can be used with the following OLAP data sources &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAP Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW)</li>
<li>Oracle Essbase</li>
<li>Microsoft Analysis Services</li>
<li>IBM Cognos TM1</li>
<li>IBM Cognos Real-time Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h3>DB2 Data Sources</h3>
<p>The DB2 connection type are used to connect to DB2 Windows, Unix and Linux, Db2 zOS, etc.</p>
<p>The common connection parameters used in DB2 data source includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Database Name</li>
<li>Timeouts</li>
<li>Signon</li>
<li>DB2 connect string</li>
<li>Collation Sequence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a Data Source Connection in IBM Cognos</h2>
<p>To create models in IBM Cognos Framework Manager, there is a need to create a data source connection. When defining the data source connection, you need to enter the connection parameters – location of database, timeout interval, Sign-on, etc.</p>
<p>In IBM Cognos Connection &rarr; click on the <b>Launch IBM Cognos Administration</b></p>
<img src="images/ibm_cognos_administration.jpg" alt="IBM Cognos Administration" />

<p>You can use the Test connection to test the connectivity to the data source using connection parameters that you have defined. Click on the finish button once done.</p>
<h2>Data Source Security Setup</h2>
<p>Data Source Security can be defined using IBM Cognos authentication. As per the data source, different types of authentication can be configured in the Cognos connection &minus;</p>
<p><b>No Authentication</b> &minus; This allows login to the data source without using any sign-on credentials. This type of connection doesn’t provide data source security in connection.</p>
<p><b>IBM Cognos Software Service Credential</b> &minus; In this type of a sign-on, you log in to the data source using a logon specified for the IBM Cognos Service and the user does not require a separate database sign-on. In a live environment, it is advisable to use individual database sign on.</p>
<p><b>External Name Space</b> &minus; It requires the same BI logon credentials that are used to authenticate the external authentication namespace. The user must be logged into the name space before logging in to the data source and it should be active.</p>
<img src="images/signons.jpg" alt="Signons" />
<p>All the data sources also support data source sign-on defined for everyone in the group or for individual users, group or roles. If the data source requires a data source sign-on, but you don't have the access to a sign-on for this data source, you will be prompted to log on each time you access the data source.</p>
<p>IBM Cognos also supports security at cube level. If you are using cubes, security may be set at the cube level. For <b>Microsoft Analysis Service</b>, security is defined at the cube level roles.</p>
<h1>Cognos - Packages</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to create a package using COGNOS.</p>

<h1>Cognos - Framework Manager</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss regarding what a Framework Manager is and about its various other components.</p>
<h2>What is a Framework Manager?</h2>
<p>IBM Cognos Framework Manager is used to create business model of metadata derived from one or more data sources. It is a Windows based tool which is used to publish the business models to Cognos BI in the form of packages which can be used for analytical reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>Before you start a new project in Framework Manager, it is necessary that you go through BI reporting requirements that helps you to identify data strategies, metadata, report package delivery, etc. This helps you to identify which data sources are required in the Framework Manager to get the required data in the BI report. You should consider the following factors before starting a new project in the Framework manager.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data Sources required to meet BI needs.</li>
<li>Types of DW system</li>
<li>Data refresh in Data Warehouse</li>
<li>BI Reporting- Daily, Weekly, or monthly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Metadata Modeling</h2>
<p>A Metadata model is defined as the collection of database objects (tables, columns and relationship between objects) imported from the database. When you run the report, metadata published in BI Cognos portal generates a SQL statement according to the query.</p>
<img src="images/metadata_modeling.jpg" alt="Metadata Modeling" />
<p>The IBM Cognos Framework manager can hide the complexity of data in the data source and also alter the way how data is shown to users. It provides a view that is easy for BI users to understand and perform analysis and reporting.</p>
<h2>IBM Cognos Framework Manager User Interface</h2>
<p>The following screenshot shows the IBM Cognos BI Framework Manager User Interface.</p>
<img src="images/user_interface.jpg" alt="User Interface" />
<p>Following are the various components of the above screenshot that are explained in detail for better understanding &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Project Viewer</b> &minus; This pane on left side allows you to access all the existing projects in a tree format.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Project Info</b> &minus; This is the center pane that is used to manage objects of an existing project. This has three tabs: Explorer, Diagram and Dimension.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Properties</b> &minus; This pane at the bottom is used to set the value of different properties of an object in a project.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Tools</b> &minus; This pane on the right side provides you various important useful tools. You can perform a search, or display an object and its dependent objects, changing project language, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Importing Metadata from a Relational Database</h2>
<p>For importing Metadata from a Relational Database, you map the database objects to the Framework manager objects. In the Framework Manager, you can import all the objects or you can select particular objects like tables, columns, functions, stored procedures, views, etc.</p>
<p>Only user defined Stored procedures are supported.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">Database Objects</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Framework Manager Objects</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>Column</td><td>Query Item</td></tr>
<tr><td>View</td><td>Query Subject</td></tr>
<tr><td>Synonym</td><td>Query Subject</td></tr>
<tr><td>Procedure</td><td>Query Subject</td></tr>
<tr><td>Table</td><td>Query Subject</td></tr>
<tr><td>Function</td><td>Project Function</td></tr>
</table>
<p>To create a metadata model, run metadata wizard from the Action menu. Select a data source connection and click the Next button. Select the check boxes for the objects you want to import.</p>
<p>Specify how the import should handle duplicate object names. Choose either to import and create a unique name, or not to import. If you choose to create a unique name, the imported object appears with a number.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; When you see QuerySubject and QuerySubject1 in your project. Then click Import.</p>
<img src="images/querysubject.jpg" alt="QuerySubject" />
<p>Import statistics including a list of objects that could not be imported and a count of objects that were imported are shown.</p>
<p>The next step is to click on the Finish button.</p>
<p>After importing Metadata, you must check the imported Metadata for the following areas &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Relationships and Cardinality</li>
<li>Determinants</li>
<li>Usage property for query items</li>
<li>Regular Aggregate property for query items</li>
</ul>
<h3>Importing Metadata from Cognos 8 Model</h3>
<p>In the Framework Manager, you can also import metadata from an existing Cognos 8 Model. To import Metadata from the Cognos 8 model, go to <b>Actions &rarr; Run Metadata wizard</b>.</p>
<p>Click on the Cognos 8 Model and then the Next button. Navigate to the .cpf file from Cognos 8 Model and the click on Next.</p>
<p>Select the check boxes for objects you want to import and then click on Next and then on Finish.</p>
<h3>Modeling Relational Metadata</h3>
<p>Once you import the metadata, next is to validate the objects for reporting requirement. You can select the objects that appear in the report and test them. You can create two views of the Metadata Model &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Import View</li>
<li>Business View</li>
</ul>
<p>The Import view shows you the metadata imported from the data source. To validate the data as per your BI reporting, you can perform the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Ensure that the relationships reflect the reporting requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize and customize the data retrieved by the query subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize and customize the data retrieved by dimensions. You may want to store dimensions in a separate dimensional view.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle support for multilingual metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>Control how data is used and formatted by checking query item properties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Business view is used to provide the information in metadata. You can perform calculations, aggregations and apply filters in Business view and easily allow users to build the report. You can add business rules such as custom calculations and filters that define the information users can retrieve.</p>
<p>Organize the model by creating separate views for each user group that reflect the business concepts familiar to your users.</p>
<h1>Cognos - Relationships in Metadata Model</h1>
<p>Relationships are used to create queries on multiple objects in a metadata model. Relationships can be bidirectional and without creating relationship, objects are individual entities with no use in metadata model.</p>
<p>Each object in metadata model is connected using primary or foreign key in the data source. You can create or remove relationships in the metadata model to meet the business requirements.</p>
<p>There are different relationships which are possible, some of them are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>One to One</b> &minus; When an instance of one query subject is related to another instance. For example: Each customer has one customer id.</p></li>
<li><p><b>One to Many</b> &minus; This relationship occurs when one instance of query subject relates to multiple instances. For example: Each doctor has many patients.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Many to Many</b> &minus; This relationship occurs when many instances of a query subject relates to multiple instances. For example: Each patient has many doctors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cardinality Concept</h2>
<p>It is defined as the number of related rows for each of the two query subjects. Cardinality is used in the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Loop Joins in Star schema</li>
<li>Optimized access to data source</li>
<li>Avoid double counting fact data</li>
</ul>
<p>While using the Relational database as a data source, Cardinality can be defined considering the following rules &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Primary and Foreign keys</li>
<li>Match query item names represent uniquely indexed columns</li>
<li>Matching query item names</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common ways to define Cardinality is by using the primary and foreign key. To view the key information that was imported, right click on the query subject &rarr; Edit Definition. You can import many to many relationships, optional relationships, and outer joins from the data source.</p>
<h2>Relationship Notation in Metadata Model</h2>
<p>In the Framework manager, a relation is represented by <b>Merise notation</b>. The first part of this notation represents the type of join for this relationship.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>0..1 represents zero or one match</li>
<li>1..1 represents one to one match</li>
<li>0..n represents Zero or no matches</li>
<li>1..n represents One or more matches</li>
<li>1 &minus; An inner join with all matching rows from both objects.</li>
<li>0 &minus; An Outer join with all objects from both, including the items that don’t match.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating or Modifying the Relationships</h2>
<p>To create a Relationship or to combine logically related objects which are not joined in metadata import. You can manually create relationship between objects or can automatically define relationship between objects based on selected criteria.</p>
<p>To create a Relationship, use CTRL key to select one or more query items, subjects or dimensions. Then go to <b>Action Menu &rarr; Create Relationship</b>.</p>
<p>If this is a valid Relationship, the Framework manager wants to create a shortcut to the relationship. You can then click on the OK button.</p>
<img src="images/f_sales.jpg" alt="F_SALES" />
<p>Once you create a relationship after the metadata import, you can also modify the relationship or Cardinality in the Framework manager.</p>
<p>To edit a Relationship, click a relationship and from <b>Action menu &rarr; click Edit Definition</b>.</p>
<p>From the <b>Relationship Expression tab &rarr; Select Query items, Cardinalities and Operators</b>.</p>
<img src="images/relationship_defination.jpg" alt="Relationship Defination" />
<p>To create an additional Join, go to the <b>Relationship Expression tab &rarr; New Link and Define New Relationship</b>.</p>
<p>To test this Relationship, go to <b>Relationship SQL tab &rarr; rows to be returned &rarr; Test</b>.</p>
<img src="images/relationship_sql_tab.jpg" alt="Relationship SQL tab" />
<p>Click on OK button.</p>
<h2>Creating a Relationship Shortcut</h2>
<p>A Relationship shortcut is defined as the pointer to an existing relationship and to reuse the definition of an existing relationship. When you make any change to the source Relationship, they are automatically updated in shortcuts. Relationship shortcuts are also used to resolve ambiguous relationship between query subjects.</p>
<p>The Framework Manager asks whether you want to create a relationship shortcut whenever you create a relationship and both these conditions are true.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>At least one end for the new relationship is a shortcut.</li>
<li>A relationship exists between the original objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to <b>Action Menu &rarr; Create Relationship</b>.</p>
<p>If this is a valid Relationship, Framework manager wants to create a shortcut to the relationship. Click YES. A list appears of all relationships in which one end is a model object and the other end is either another model object or a shortcut to another model object.</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>
<h2>Create a Query Subject</h2>
<p>A query subject is defined as a set of query items that have an inherent relationship. A query subject can be used to customize the data they retrieve using a Framework Manager.</p>
<p>The following are the query subject types in a Framework Manager &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Data Source Query Subject</b> &minus; These are based on the Relational metadata defined by the SQL statements and are automatically created for each table and view when you import metadata into model.</p>
<p><i><b>Note</b> &minus; The data source query subject references the data from only one data source at a time, but you can directly edit the SQL that defines the retrieve data to edit the query subject.</i></p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Model Query Subjects</b> &minus; They are not directly created from a data source but are based on the query items defined in other query subjects or dimensions. Using the model query subject, it allows you to create more abstract and business view of data source.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Stored Procedure Query Subjects</b> &minus; They are created when a Procedure is imported from a Relational data source. IBM Cognos Framework Manager only supports user defined Stored Procedures and system stored procedures are not supported.</p></li>
</ul>

<li>Ongoing and Unchanged</li>
<li>Ceased</li>
</ul>
<p>An event key is used to determine whether an event is new, ongoing but changed, ongoing and unchanged, or ceased. Event Studio compares the event instances detected in each agent run with those detected in the previous run. To ensure it correctly matches the event instances for comparison, you must define an event key. The event key is the combination of data items that uniquely defines an event instance.</p>
<h2>Agent</h2>
<p>An agent runs to check occurrences of the event. An agent performs a task for events that meet the execution rules.</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>A task can be used to notify users about a change in business event. Users can take appropriate actions as per the event.</p>
