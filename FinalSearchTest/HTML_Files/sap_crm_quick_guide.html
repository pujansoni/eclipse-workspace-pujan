<ul class="list">
<li>Sales Organization</li>
<li>Distribution channel</li>
<li>Divisions</li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP CRM - Taxes</h1>
<p>To calculate tax in billing for CRM sales, <b>Transaction Tax Engine</b> (TTE) is used. TTE is used to determine and calculate tax on invoice statements and to calculate external tax. TTE is used in both CRM and SRM to calculate the tax.</p>
<p>To implement Transaction Tax Engine, you have to make the setting in customizing for cross application components.</p>
<p>Go to <b>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Cross-Application Components &rarr; Transaction Tax Engine &rarr; Tax Maintenance Settings &rarr; Tax Determination and Calculation &rarr; Define Tax Event Determination</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_crm/images/cross_application_components.jpg" alt="Cross-Application Components" />
<p>The key factor which is used to calculate the tax and for tax determination is a tax event. Applicable tax type, tax rate, locations and other factors are determined. It uses the decision tree to make tax determination and calculation more simple and transparent. You can also use simulation tool in TTE for tax determination and for testing customizing settings.</p>
<p>The Tax Calculation Process has the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>TTE compiles an input document.</p></li>
<li><p>Tax event is derived by TTE from this input document.</p></li>
<li><p>Next is to derive the applicable tax calculation procedure and tax type from the tax event using TTE.</p></li>
<li><p>Then TTE sends the applicable tax calculation procedure to the Special Purpose Entity SPE for tax amount calculation.</p></li>
<li><p>TTE receives the tax calculation amount from the Special Purpose entity SPE.</p></li>
<li><p>The TTE then compiles the output document and returns the tax determination results like- tax type, tax calculation procedure, and tax calculation amount.</p></li>
</ul>

In this scenario, predefined follow up activities are triggered as escalation measure.</p>
<p>You can define two different escalation levels to notify the designated parties that SLA has been crossed for the service request. First level escalation is triggered when SLA is crossed for the first time. Second level escalation is triggered when the first level crosses its time limit.</p>
<p>Escalations are managed and controlled with the use of actions.</p>
<p>Go to <b>SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Customer Relationship Management &rarr; Basic Functions &rarr; Actions &rarr; Actions in Transaction &rarr; Assign Action Profile to the Business Transaction Type</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_crm/images/assign_action.jpg" alt="Assign Action" />
<p>You can also create a batch job to automatically escalate service requests that are crossing their service level agreements.</p>
<p><b>T-Code: SE38</b></p>
<p>For each action, create a variant for the program "RSPPFPROCESS" to identify the actions and service requests you want to include in the batch job.</p>
