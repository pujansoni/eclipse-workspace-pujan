<h1>Business Law - Company Law</h1>
<h2>What is a Company?</h2>
<p>Organizations require huge investments. As the investments are big, the risks involved are also very high. While undertaking a big business, the two important limitations of partnerships are limited resources and unlimited liabilities of partners. The company form of partnerships has become popular to overcome the problems of partnership business. Various multinational companies have their investors and costumers spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>In order to maximize and utilize the organizational and managerial abilities effectively, it is necessary for a limited liability company to be supported not only by its own organs but also by clear and precise regulations. It is necessary to have a brief overview of the business organization from the framework of company law.</p>
<p>Commercial sector recognizes three principal categories of business organizations &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sole proprietorship (Generally used for informal purposes)</li>
<li>Partnership (General or limited)</li>
<li>Company</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of partnerships &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Persecution per data (governed by the civil code)</li>
<li>Persecution firms (governed by the civil code as well as the commercial code)</li>
<li>Persecution (governed by the civil code as well as the commercial code)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is difficult to determine the absolute equivalents between these partnerships and partnerships under common law tradition.</p>
<h2>Meaning and Nature of  Company</h2>
<p>According to the Companies Act, 1956, “A company is a person, artificial, invisible, intangible, and existing only in the contemplation of the law. Being a mere creature of the law, it possesses only those properties which the character of its creation confers upon it either expressly or as incidental to its very existence.”</p>
<p><b>It can clearly be defined that &minus;</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company is defined as a group of people that contributes money or the worth of money to a common stock to employ it in some trade or business. The people in this group share the profit or loss (as the case may be) arising as a result.</p></li>
<li><p>The common stock is usually denoted in terms of money and is the capital of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The persons who contribute to the common stock are the members.</p></li>
<li><p>The proportion of the capital entitled to each member is called the member’s share.</p></li>
<li><p>Shares are always transferrable subject to the restrictions and liabilities offered by the rights to transfer shares.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main characteristics of a company are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Incorporated Association</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company can be created only under the registration of the Company Act.</p></li>
<li><p>It comes into existence from the date when the certificate of incorporation is issued.</p></li>
<li><p>At least seven persons are required to form a public company.</p></li>
<li><p>At least two persons are required to form a private company.</p></li>
<li><p>These persons will subscribe to the memorandum of associations and also comply with the other legal requirements of the Company Act in respect of registration to form and incorporate the company, with or without liability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Artificial Legal Person</h3>
<p>A company can be considered as an artificial person (a person who cannot act on his own will). It has to act through a board of shareholders elected or selected by the members of the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The board of directors works as the only brain of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>It has the rights to acquire and dispose the properties, to enter into contract with third parties in its own name, and can sue and can be sued in its own name.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it cannot be considered as a citizen as it cannot enjoy the rights of a citizen.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
<p>A company is perceived to be a distinct legal entity and one that does not depend on its members. The money credited by the creditors of the company can be recovered only from the company and the properties owned by the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Individual members cannot be sued.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the company in any way is not liable for the individual debts of the members.</p></li>
<li><p>The properties of the company can only be used for the development, betterment, maintenance, and welfare of the company and cannot be used for personal benefits of the shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>A member cannot claim any ownership rights over the company either single-handedly or jointly.</p></li>
<li><p>The members of the company can enter into contracts with the company in the same manner as any other individual can.</p></li>
<li><p>The Income Tax Act also recognizes company as a separate legal entity.</p></li>
<li><p>The company has to pay income tax as it earns profits and when dividends are paid to the shareholders, the shareholders also have to pay income tax based on the dividends earned. This highlights the fact that the shareholders and the company are two separate individual entities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Perpetual Existence</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company is said to be a stable form of business organization.</p></li>
<li><p>A company’s life does not depend upon the death, insolvency or retirement of any or all of its shareholders or directors.</p></li>
<li><p>It is created by law and can only be dissolved by law.</p></li>
<li><p>Members can join or leave the company but the company can continue forever.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Seal</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>A company cannot sign documents by itself.</li>
<li>It acts through natural persons who are called its directors.</li>
<li>A common seal is used with the name of the company engraved on it as a substitute of its signature.</li>
<li>To be legally binding on the company, a document has to carry the company seal on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limited Liability</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company may be limited by shares or by guarantee.</p></li>
<li><p>In a company limited by shares, the liability of members is limited to the unpaid value of the shares.</p></li>
<li><p>In a company limited by guarantee, the liability of members is limited to such an amount as the members may undertake to contribute to the asset of the company in the events of it being wound up.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Transferrable Shares</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The shares can be freely transferred in case of a public company.</p></li>
<li><p>The right to transfer shares is a statutory right and it cannot be taken away by any provision.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the manner in which such transfer of shares is to be made should be provided and it may also contain bona fide and reasonable restrictions on the rights of members for transfer of their shares.</p></li>
<li><p>However, in case of private companies, the article shall restrict the rights of the members to transfer their shares in companies with its statutory description.</p></li>
<li><p>If a company refuses to register the transfer of shares, a shareholder may apply to the Central Government in order to make the right to transfer shares legal.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Delegated Management</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Any company can be considered as an autonomous, self-governing and self-controlling organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to the presence of a large number of members, all members cannot take part in the management of different affairs of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Control and management is therefore delegated to the elected representatives called directors, who are elected by the shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>The directors supervise the day-to-day work and progress of the company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification of Companies</h2>
<p>All the companies must be registered under the Companies Act. A certificate of incorporation must be issued by the registrar of the company after registration. Different jurisdictions can form different companies. Some of the most common types of companies are as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Private Company</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A company is said to be a private company if it does not allow its shareholders to transfer shares.</p></li>
<li><p>If any transfer of shares is allowed, the company limits the number of its members to 50 and does not entertain any invitations to the public for subscribing any shares of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies offer limited liabilities to their shareholders but also place some restrictions on their ownership.</p></li>
<li><p>A private company can have a minimum of 2 members and a maximum of 50 members, excluding the employees and the shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>A private company is desirable in those cases where it is intended to take the advantage of corporate life, has limited liability and the control of the business is in the hands of few persons.</p></li>
<li><p>In private sector, an individual can gain control of the entire business firm.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Public Company</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>At least seven members are needed to form a public company.</li>
<li>The maximum number of members remains unrestricted in the case of public companies.</li>
<li>A Prospectus is issued by the public companies to invite people to buy the shares of the company.</li>
<li>The liability of the members is limited by the value of the shares they purchase.</li>
<li>The shares of a public company are sold and bought freely without any obstruction in the stock market.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Companies Limited by Guarantee</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Every member of these companies promises to pay a fixed amount of money in the event of liquidation of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>This amount is denoted as guarantee.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no liability to pay anything more than the value of the share and the guarantee. Some of the substantial resultants of companies limited by guarantee are charities, community projects, clubs, societies, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of these companies are not into any profit-making.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies can be considered as private companies offering limited liabilities to their members.</p></li>
<li><p>A guarantee company substitutes share capitals with guarantors willing to pay a guarantee amount upon the liquidation of the company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Companies Limited by Share</h3>
<p>In the case of companies limited by shares, the shareholders pay a nominal value of money contributing to the share capital. The payments can be done either at a time or by installments.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The members do not have to pay anything more than the fixed value of the share. Companies limited by shares are the most popular among the registered companies.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies are required to have the suffix ‘Limited’ at the end of their names so that the people know that the liability of its members is limited.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Unlimited Company</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Unlimited companies are the companies where the liabilities of the shareholders are unlimited as in the case of partnership firms.</p></li>
<li><p>Such companies are permitted under the Companies Act but are not known.</p></li>
<li><p>These types of companies are incorporated either with or without a share capital.</p></li>
<li><p>The shareholders are liable to donate whatever sums are required to pay the outstanding debts of the company, should it go into formal liquidation and if there is any need to meet the insufficiency of assets to pay the debts and liabilities and the fixed cost of liquidation.</p></li>
<li><p>The members or shareholders have no direct liability to the creditors or security holders of an unlimited company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Principle of Separate Legal Existence</h1>
<p>The Principle of Separate Legal Existence is a fundamental principle in the field of company law. According to this principle, the company is treated as an entity separate from its members.</p>
<h2>Functions of Separate Legal Existence</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In order to create a company, the promoters of the company must produce certain documents to the registrar of companies.</p></li>
<li><p>The registrar presides over the government agency known as the Companies House.</p></li>
<li><p>After checking the documents, the registrar will issue a certificate of incorporation and the company starts to exist as a corporate body.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Separate Legal Entity</h3>
<p>The most important consequence of incorporation is that a company is regarded as a person. It has its own rights and the rights are different from the rights of its owners.</p>
<h3>Limited Liability</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>When Shareholders buy shares from a certain Company and pay a certain percentage amount of the shares rather than paying the full amount, and when the company is dissolved, then the shareholders are liable to pay the rest of the amount.</p></li>
<li><p>If a shareholder has paid the full amount, he/she is not liable to pay any amount upon dissolution of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, shareholders have a limited liability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Perpetual Succession</h3>
<p>This refers to the existence of any organization despite the death, bankruptcy, insanity, change in membership of any member from the business. In such instances, the shares are passed on to the next generation.</p>
<h3>Ownership of Property</h3>
<p>Certain properties can be owned by a company. These properties continue to be owned by the companies regardless of their shareholders and members.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>These properties are used when a company needs to borrow money as a security.</li>
<li>These properties may be the present or future assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contractual Capacity</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>A company has the ability to make contracts.</li>
<li>The company can sue or be sued on the basis of these contracts.</li>
<li>The power to make contracts is delegated to human agents working for the company.</li>
<li>The contracts are carried out by the directors and other agents of the company.</li>
<li>The company, as a person itself, is subjected to the rights and liabilities imposed by the contract.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criminal Liability</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>For someone to be found guilty of committing a crime, the individual’s actions and mindset must fit the crime.</li>
<li>It is generally perceived that companies cannot commit any crime as they do not have minds of their own.</li>
<li>However, the courts assume the controllers of the company to be the minds of the company.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Business Law - The Corporate Veil</h1>
<p>It is seen that a company, as a person, has a legal identity of its own. An obvious consequence is that the company in question may become liable for the actions of the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Usually, the owners of the company are free from any liability.</p></li>
<li><p>It is assumed that the owners of the company are protected from liabilities by the company under a ‘veil of incorporation’.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there are certain circumstances when the court of law removes the veil so that the members of the corporation are not protected anymore by the veil.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is no specific list of circumstances when the court of law is supposed to remove the veil.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the veil has been removed in the past under the following circumstances &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Where the formation of the company was intended for a fraudulent purpose.</li>
<li>Where the company was considered as an enemy at the time of war.</li>
<li>Where several groups of companies were regarded as one.</li>
<li>Where a company was treated as a partnership with an intent to wind up.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Duties of Separate Legal Existence</h2>
<p>A company, after being incorporated, is considered as a separate person in the eyes of the law and the court of justice. Hence, the company is considered separate from its shareholders and the owners.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It has the right to sue and the company can be sued just as a natural person.</p></li>
<li><p>The liabilities of the owners and shareholders of the corporation are only limited to the value of shares invested in the specific company.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conversion from a Private Company to a Close Company</h2>
<p>Various difficulties may arise for a buyer when he tries to obtain a mortgage bond for paying the purchase price. According to section 38 of the Companies Act, no company is allowed to offer any financial help for the purpose of acquisition of shares of a company.</p>
<p>This justifies that if a company owns a particular property, the buyer cannot raise money based on this property to pay the purchase price.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>For avoiding this limitation, a company has to be converted into a close corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>No such limitation is invoked in the Close Companies Act.</p></li>
<li><p>For a company to become a close corporation, the number of shareholders of the company must be limited to 10.</p></li>
<li><p>The shareholders must also qualify the terms, conditions and set of qualifications as aforesaid by the Close Companies Act.</p></li>
<li><p>A registration number will be allotted to the company by the registrar upon such conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the Companies Act, in the context of such a conversion, the existing shareholders become the only existing members of the company and no more shareholders are allowed after the conversion is performed.</p></li>
<li><p>The new found close corporation hence adopts the name of the private company from which it is derived.</p></li>
<li><p>A certificate on the basis of the foundation of the close corporation is issued.</p></li>
<li><p>A CCI (Close Corporation founding Statement) is also registered.</p></li>
<li><p>In case the members desire to change the name of the close corporation during the conversion, the registrar’s consent is required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Close Corporation</h3>
<p>A close corporation can be considered analogous to a ‘younger brother’ of the company. It is way simpler and quicker to manage and maintain.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Annual income tax returns are required.</p></li>
<li><p>However, no audited financial statement is required by the law.</p></li>
<li><p>A close corporation can have the number of members limited to 10.</p></li>
<li><p>A close corporation also has a separate legal identity, i.e., it is also considered as a person in the views of the law irrespective of its members.</p></li>
<li><p>In many cases, a close corporation is intended for its owners to sell the properties owned by the close corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, any member of the close corporation may come into a contract on behalf of the close corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>However, restrictions may be imposed by an association agreement and the consent of a member holding a member’s interest of at least 75% or the consent of the members holding that percentage of member’s interest collectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>A partnership is considered to be a formal relationship between a minimum of two and a maximum of twenty members based on an agreement intended to share profits through various business ventures, where each member contributes something (either money or skills) to the business.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A partnership firm has no separate persona from the partners.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, it is treated as a separate entity for transaction and registrations.</li>
<li>An agreement bound by the partnership can be concluded by any of the partners.</li>
<li>The partnership will not be binding if a partner concludes a contract outside the scope of the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trusts</h3>
<p>A trust appears to be a complicated concept, not easily understood as a close corporation or a company. A trust does not have a separate legal identity. The law usually looks through the entity to what is behind it.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The rate of income tax imposed on a trust is similar to the rate of income tax imposed on a natural person and not a flat rate as imposed in the case of a closed corporation or a company.</p></li>
<li><p>A person does not own a trust.</p></li>
<li><p>A trust can neither have shareholders nor members.</p></li>
<li><p>A trust comes into existence when the founder of the trust hands over the ownership of an asset to a trustee who administers and manages the asset for the benefit of a beneficiary third person.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, trusts are created for charitable purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>A trustee acts in his official capacity rather than his private capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>The ownership of a trust does not belong to any individual.</p></li>
<li><p>The ownership is divided between the trustees of the trust who work for the profit of a beneficiary.</p></li>
<li><p>The beneficiary does not have any control over the assets of the trust.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>A Sole Proprietorship</h3>
<p>A sole proprietorship can be considered as a single person business. It Small scale enterprises are generally owned and operated on the basis of sole proprietorship. Enterprises based on this do not require any registration. An informal trader or estate agent are probably the best examples of sole proprietors.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A sole proprietor is considered to be an independent legal entity.</li>
<li>There is no legal protection against claims of a sole proprietor.</li>
<li>The personal properties or assets of a sole proprietor will be at stake in case he issued.</li>
<li>As the proprietor of the business, the owner carries the full risk of his assets and losses.</li>
<li>The owner may also be subjected to sequestration.</li>
<li>In the context of sequestration, if the proprietor is married in a community of property, the ownership of the estate owned by his spouse may also be held by a natural person, a trust or any other separate legal entity.</li>
<li>In case of any uncertainties whether to hold a property in a person’s personal name, legal consultants must be consulted before signing any legal agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Liabilities &amp; Rights of Promoters</h1>

<h1>Business Law - Shares</h1>
<p>Through the course of time, Business Law has evolved in the field of the division and flexibility in transferability of the ownership of a company. Each shareholder is considered an owner of the company. The degree of ownership depends on the number of shares each individual buys.</p>
<p>Any kind of shares can be issued in accordance with the company’s articles of association. The articles of association are a set of guidelines, which provide the rules for buying, selling and transferring different types of shares. The articles of association also mention the types of shares, which could be transacted by the company. Ordinary shares constitute the biggest amount of shares, but special types of shares like the alphabet
shares also exist.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Share capital is considered as the total amount of money a company owns plus the total valuation of its assets in terms of money.</p></li>
<li><p>Share capital is divided into shares.</p></li>
<li><p>Shares are valued in terms of money.</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, the amount of money collected by the company from its consumers to contribute to its capital is collectively known as share capital and individually known as shares.</p></li>
<li><p>A share contains bundles of rights and obligations contained in the articles of association.</p></li>
<li><p>A share can be considered as an interest measured by a sum of money.</p></li>
<li><p>A person who invests in the shares of a company contributes to partial ownership of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The degree of ownership of the company of a shareholder is directly proportionate to the number of shares the individual buys.</p></li>

<h1>Business Law - Company Meetings</h1>
<p>A company is considered as a legal entity separate from its members in the eyes of law. All the affairs of the company are practically carried out by the board of directors. The board of directors of a company carries out these affairs within the limitations of their powers, as invoked by the articles of association of the company. The directors also exercise certain powers of their own with the consent of other members of the company.</p>
<p>The consent of the other members is ensured at the general meetings held by the company. Any mistakes committed by the board are rectified by the shareholders (who are also considered as owners of the company) at the meetings of the company.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The shareholders’ meetings are conducted for the shareholders to give their verdict on the decisions and steps taken by the board of directors.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings are a crucial part of the management of a company as mentioned in the Companies Act, 1956.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings enable the shareholders to know the ongoing proceedings of the company and allow the shareholders to deliberate on certain issues.</p></li>
<li><p>There are various types of meetings held by a company.</p></li>
<li><p>Various criteria must be fulfilled for the calling, convening and conduct of the meetings.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Statutory Meeting</h2>
<p>A statutory meeting is held once during the life of a company. Generally, it is held just after a company is incorporated. Every public company, limited either by shares or by guarantee, must positively hold a statutory meeting as soon as the company is incorporated.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A statutory meeting should be held between a minimum period of one month and a maximum period of six months after the commencement of business of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>A meeting before a period of one month cannot be considered as a statutory meeting of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The notice for a statutory meeting should mention that a statutory meeting is going to be held on a specific date.</p></li>
<li><p>Private companies and government companies are not bound to hold any statutory meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Only public limited companies are bound to hold statutory meetings within the specified period of time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Procedure of the Statutory Meeting</h3>
<p>The board of directors must forward a statutory report to every member of the company. This report must be sent at least 21 days before the meeting. Members attending the meeting may discuss topics regarding the formation of the company or topics related to the statutory report.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>No resolutions can be taken in the statutory meeting of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The main objective of the statutory meeting is to make the members familiar with the matters regarding the promotion and formation of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>The shareholders receive particulars related to shares taken up, moneys received, contracts entered into, preliminary expenses incurred, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The shareholders also get a chance to discuss business ideas and methods and the future prospects of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>An adjourned meeting is called if the statutory meeting does not meet a conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>According to section 433 of the Companies Act, 1956, a company may be subjected to winding up if it fails to submit a statutory report or fails to conduct a statutory meeting within the aforementioned period.</p></li>

</ul>
<h3>Adjournment of Statutory Meeting</h3>
<p>According to section 165(8) of the Companies Act, a statutory meeting may be adjourned from time to time. Any resolution on which notice has been given according to the provision of the Companies Act may be passed whether the resolution was taken up before or after the last meeting.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The adjourning meeting has the same power as the original statutory meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The power to adjourn depends on the decision of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The meeting cannot be adjourned by the chairman without the consent of the members of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The chairman is expected to adjourn the meeting if the members wish to do so, without invoking any discriminatory powers given to the chairman by the articles of association of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually, the chairman is not bound to adjourn a meeting even if majority of the members wish for the adjournment.</p></li>
<li><p>The statuary meeting provides an exception in the rule that only unfinished business at the original meeting must be carried out at the adjourned meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Members have the right to initiate new topics of discussion in the adjourned meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The advantage of adjourned meetings over statutory meetings is that a resolution can be passed in an adjourned meeting, which is not possible in the case of the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>If any resolution is needed to be passed based on the topics discussed in the statutory meeting, it must be passed at an adjourning meeting to go in accordance with the law.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Default</h3>

According to section 166 of the Companies Act, all companies must hold Annual General Meetings at stipulated time intervals. The notice for an Annual General Meeting must contain all the particulars of the meeting. However, the time to hold the first Annual General Meeting for a company is relaxed to 18 months from the date of incorporation.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>As per section 166(1) of the Companies Act, a company is not bound to hold any general meetings till the first Annual General Meeting is held.</p></li>
<li><p>This relaxation is intended for the company to set up its final reports on the basis of a longer period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>One more relaxation provided by section 166(1) of the Companies Act is that with the registrar’s consent, the date of an Annual General Meeting can be postponed.</p></li>
<li><p>This date can be postponed to a maximum time period of three months.</p></li>
<li><p>However, this relaxation is not applicable for the first Annual General Meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>A company may not hold an Annual General Meeting in a year if the extension of the date of the meeting is made under the consent of the registrar.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the reasons for the extension of the meeting should be genuine and should be properly justified.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Interval between Two Annual General Meetings</h3>
<p>As per section 166(1) of the Companies Act, the time gap between two Annual General Meetings must not exceed fifteen months. According to section 210 of the Companies Act, a company must present a report containing the accounts of all the profits and losses. In case the company is not trading for profit, an income and expenditure account report must be made.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The account shall state all the profits and losses earned and endured by the company from the day of its incorporation.</p></li>
<li><p>The account shall be updated for at least 9 months from the date of the last annual general meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>A balance sheet is also required to be attached along with the account.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Annual General Meeting is subjected to three rules &minus;</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The meeting must be held every year.</li>
<li>A maximum gap of 15 months is allowed between two Annual General Meetings.</li>
<li>The meeting must be held within six months from the preparation of the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failure to comply with the above rules will be considered as an offence to the Companies Act by the law and will be treated as a default unless the registrar grants extension of time for holding a meeting.</p>
<h3>Date, Time and Place</h3>
<p>An Annual General Meeting can be held at any time during business hours. The day of the Annual General Meeting must not be a public holiday. The meeting can be held either at the registered office of the company or any preselected venue within the area of jurisdiction of the place where the registered office of the company is situated.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A public company or a private company, which acts as a subsidiary of a public company, may fix the time of the meeting according to the articles of association of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>A resolution may also be passed at a general meeting for the selection of time of the subsequent general meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>However, for a private company, the time and venue of the meetings is fixed by passing a resolution in any of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The venue for the meeting of the private company may not be situated within the area of jurisdiction of the place where the registered office of the company is situated.</p></li>
<li><p>The section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, defines a public holiday to be a Sunday or any other day as declared by the Central Government to be a public holiday. A day may be declared as a public holiday after the notice for a meeting has been issued. For avoiding difficulties that may be caused in the above mentioned scenario, section 2(38) of the Companies Act says that, “no day declared by the Central government to be a public holiday shall be a holiday in relation to such a meeting, unless the notice of declaration was issued before the declaration of the meeting.”</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Default in Holding Annual General Meeting</h3>
<p>Not holding an annual general meeting according to section 166 of the Companies Act is considered to be a serious offence in the eyes of the law. Every member of the company who is in default and the company will be rendered as defaulters.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A fine of up to INR 50,000 may be imposed on the defaulters.</p></li>
<li><p>According to section 168 of the Companies Act, if the default is found to be continuing, then a fine of INR 2,500 will be imposed on the defaulters on a daily basis till the default continues.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Extraordinary General Meeting</h3>
<p>Any general meeting of a company is considered to be an extraordinary general meeting, except the statutory meeting, an Annual General Meeting or any adjournment meeting. Such types of meetings can be fixed by the directors at any time that seems appropriate to the directors. However, the meetings must be held in accordance with the guidelines mentioned in the articles of association of the company.</p>
<p>These meetings are held generally for the transaction of the business of a special character. Various administrative affairs of a company, which can be transacted only by resolutions passed in general meetings, are carried out in these meetings.</p>
<p>It is not possible for the members of the company to wait for the next Annual General Meeting for clearance of such issues. The articles of association of a company, therefore, provides freedom to conduct extraordinary general meetings to sort out such issues.</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>By the board of directors or on the requisitions of members.</li>
<li>By the requisitionists themselves on the failure of the board to call for a meeting.</li>

</ul>
<h3>By the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>If some business of special importance requires an approval of the members of the company, the board of directors may call for an extraordinary general meeting of the company. Going in accordance with the articles of association of the company, the board of directors of a company may call for an extraordinary general meeting whenever they feel appropriate.</p>
<p>The power of a director to convene an extraordinary general meeting must be exercised at a board of directors’ meeting as in the case of all the powers exercised by the director.</p>
<p>According to the provision of the articles, if a resolution is signed by all the members of the board and is as effective as a passed resolution, a general meeting may be convened on the context of the resolution. The articles also provide the facility that there may not be sufficient number of directors to call for a general meeting.</p>
<p>Thus in case of insufficient number of directors, any director or any two members of the company can call for the general meeting in the same way as called by the board of directors.</p>
<h3>On Requisition of Members</h3>
<p>The members of the company may also request for an extraordinary general meeting to be conducted. A request for holding an extraordinary general meeting can be made by the members &minus;</p>

<li><p>Preference shareholders can also call for a general meeting if the proposed resolution is going to affect their interest.</p></li>
<li><p>If a member ceases to withdraw after the requisition is made, the withdrawal will not invalidate the requisition.</p></li>
<li><p>The appointment of shares does not affect the rights of a member to make requisitions or vote at a meeting.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>It is not necessary for the requisitionists to disclose the reasons for the resolution to be proposed at the meeting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>By the Company Law Board</h3>
<p>If it is practically impossible to call a meeting other than an Annual General Meeting for any arbitrary reasons, the Company Law Board, under section 186, may order a meeting to be called, either of its own accord or by an application of any director of the company to the Company Law Board.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Proposal or Offer</h3>
<p>Making an offer is one of the initial steps in creating a contract. An offer or a proposal must be made by the first party, which initiates the contract to the second party. The first party is often termed as the offeror and the second party is often termed as the offeree. If the offeree accepts the entire offer without any negotiations or changes, the contract comes into existence.</p>

<h1>Business Law - Law of Sale of Goods</h1>
<p>Various businessmen and consumers normally have the freedom to get into whatever contract they see fit for themselves. Contracts involving sales of goods may however be liable by some statutory restrictions. Various rules and guidelines are created keeping in mind the safety and security of the consumers.</p>
<p>The Law of Sale of Goods provides such guidelines and liabilities for the safety and security of the consumers. Any firm or person entering into the business of selling goods to consumers should be aware of the fact that the law will impose certain terms and conditions on each transaction.</p>
<p>Consumers can be defined as the group of people who buy certain commodities which will not be involved in their trade, profession or business. Consumers lie at the end of the trade chain.</p>
<h2>Important Sections</h2>
<p>Most of the terms and conditions of the Law of the Sale of Goods, 1979 are found between sections 12 and 15 of the law. Some of the important aspects of the law are discussed below.</p>

<h1>Business Law - Law of Arbitration</h1>
<p>With the increase in the international trade and the economic development of countries, there has also been an increase in the number of disputes related to commerce. Our country has also been the battleground of many disputes. Many Indian courts are already overburdened for justice in many serious cases, resulting in the lack of priority for commercial disputes. As a result, various alternative dispute resolution mechanisms like arbitration come into play.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of arbitration in India would be the panchayat system. People used to submit their disputes to the panchayats to seek justice. The Arbitration Act was passed in 1940 and hence was the law governing arbitration in India.</p>
<h2>The Arbitration Act, 1940</h2>
<p>Only domestic arbitration was dealt with by this act. According to this act, there were three stages of arbitration &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Before the reference of the dispute to the arbitral tribunal</li>
<li>During the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal</li>
<li>After the award was passed by the arbitral tribunal</li>
</ul>
<p>This act required all the intervention of the court in all the three stages of the arbitration process. It was needed to prove the existence of an agreement of the dispute. It was necessary for the award to become a rule of the court before the making of the award.</p>
<h2>The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</h2>
<p>The 1940 act was revisited in 1996. The 1940 act was revisited in order to provide an effective dispute resolution framework. The 1996 act has two important parts.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Part I is involved in any arbitration conducted in India and enforcement of awards respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Part II is involved in the enforcement of foreign awards.</p></li>
<li><p>Any arbitration or enforcement of award with respect to the arbitration (whether domestic or international) conducted in India is enacted by Part 1 of the 1996 Act.</p></li>
<li><p>The enforcement of any foreign award, to which the New York Convention or the Geneva Convention applies, is enacted by Part II of the 1996 Act.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1940 Act was designed for international arbitrations only, whereas the 1996 Act applies both to international as well as domestic arbitration.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1996 law goes beyond the 1940 Act with respect to the area of minimizing judicial intervention.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Business Law - Law of Carriage of Goods</h1>

<ul class="list">
<li><p>A private carrier is defined as an entity which carries its own goods or the goods of selected persons.</p></li>
<li><p>Private carriers are governed by the Indian Contract Act rather than the Carriage by Road Act, 2007.</p></li>
<li><p>The Carriage by Road Act, 2007 was passed to revise the then obsolete Carriers Act, 1865.</p></li>
<li><p>The act deals with the regulation of common carriers, limiting their liability and declaration of value of goods delivered to them to determine their liability for loss or damage to such goods due to the negligence or criminal acts carried out by themselves, their servants or agents.</p></li>
<li><p>Except Jammu and Kashmir, the act applies to the whole of India.</p></li>
