<h1>SAP APO - Introduction</h1>
<p>Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO) module is one of the key component under SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM). It provides different business processes related to Demand Planning, Supply Network Planning (SNP), Production Planning/Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS), Transport Management and Global Available-to-Promise.</p> 
<p>APO is tightly integrated with ECC system using a core interface (CIF) and provides full reporting functionalities on top of data marts and InfoCubes. 
With the recent release of Supply Chain Management (SCM) 5.0, a new set of functionality has been added - Service Parts Planning - to perform spare part management under Supply Chain. SAP APO provides complete integrated functions to manage supply chain processes and supports various features.</p>   
<p>The use of Supplier Network Collaboration (SNC) (also known as Inventory Collation Hub (ICH)) to provide collaboration between the suppliers and the customers. Using APO, you can achieve coordination between different partners at all stages of the supply chain process. It starts from receiving an order, monitoring the stock, and shipping of the product. You can constantly perform optimization and evaluation of Supply Chain process and monitor process efficiency. APO also provides BI component to support Reporting functions and data marts.</p> 
<p>Advanced Planning and Optimization consists of following application functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Demand Planning</li>
<li>Supply Network Planning</li>
<li>Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS)</li>
<li>Supply Chain Collaboration</li>
<li>Global Availability</li>
<li>Transport Management</li>
<li>Supply Chain Collaboration/Inventory Collation Hub</li>
</ul>
<p>SAP APO is installed as part of SAP Supply Chain Management server installation or it is also available as an add-on tool to SAP ERP package.</p>
<h1>SAP APO - Deployment Options</h1>
<p>SAP SCM Server installation provides all the features of SAP APO function module.</p>  
<p>In an add-on deployment model of SAP APO, following components are available as part of SAP APO tool &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>SAP APO &minus; Demand planning, i.e. SCM-APO-FCS</p></li>
<li><p>SAP APO Supply Network planning, i.e. SCM-APO-SNP</p></li>
<li><p>SAP APO Production Planning and Detailed scheduling, i.e. SCM-APO-PPS</p></li>
<li><p>SAP APO Global Available-to-Promise, i.e. SCM-APO-ATP</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In an Add-on deployment model, following application components are not available w.r.t SAP SCM server installation &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Service Parts Planning, i.e. SCM-APO-SPP</p></li>
<li><p>Maintenance and Service Planning, SCM-APO-MSP</p></li>
<li><p>Integration of SAP APO and Supply Network Collaboration (SNC)</p></li>
<li><p>Global Available-to-Promise (ATP) integration with SAP CRM</p></li>
<li><p>SAP APO Services related to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Post Installation Steps</h2>
<p>Once you perform add-on installation, you need to activate /SAPAPO/APO_ON_ERP. This is used for SAP APO system setup. You need to activate this in the same client where SAP APO is installed on SAP ERP system.</p>
<p>In SAP ERP system, you can check the deployment option of SAP APO as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p>Navigate to System &rarr; Status tab in SAP ERP</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/status.jpg" alt="Status" />
<p>Under component information in SAP System Data group. You can recognize the deployment option as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>When you see SCMPLUS component, it means you are in SCM server system i.e. SCM server deployment of SAP APO.</p></li>
<li><p>When the component &minus; SCMPLUS is not listed, it means that you are in an ERP system, i.e. add-on deployment model of SAP APO. You can scroll down in the component list using left slide bar.</p></li>
<li><p>When you select the component, you can also navigate to the Details tab at the top to check the details of the component.</p></li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/installed_software.jpg" alt="Installed Software" />
</ul>
<h1>SAP APO - Architecture</h1>
<p>SAP APO architecture consists of multiple components - Database, BI environment contains InfoCubes and Live Cache. InfoCubes are part of BI data mart and live cache is the main area where you keep all the data related to planning and scheduling. You can perform complex calculations in live cache and this improves the performance during calculations and reporting.</p> 
<p>In a normal deployment scenario of APO, there is only one cache per installation.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture" />
<p>Although there is a single cache, the data can be loaded in three different ways as per the application type.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Time Series &minus; Suitable for Demand Planning and Supply Network Planning</p></li>
<li><p>As an Order with a category &minus; Suitable for SNP, Production Planning/Detailed Scheduling, and Transport Planning and Vehicle Scheduling</p></li>
<li><p>ATP time series &minus; Available-to-Promise </p></li>
</ul>
<p>SAP BI functionality is primarily used by Demand Planning (DP), and depends on InfoCube which contains historical data. Processing of data is done in Time Series live cache and Supply Network Planning. PP/DS uses order live cache and SNP uses data for Time Series live cache.</p>
<p>Available-to-Promise relies on data in ATP Time Series Live Cache.</p>
<p>In SAP APO and ERP integration, most of the transactional data - Planned orders, purchase requirements - are created in APO, while data related to execution - Sales Order and Purchase Orders - are maintained in SAP ERP. For the integration of transactional data and history, a plug is provided by SAP. Plug-in contains a Core Interface (CIF) and also the interface to SAP BI structure.</p>  
<p>SAP BI system gets data from Logistics Information System (LIS) in SAP ERP, which stores all the transactional data. Data is stored in InfoCubes with the use of periodic jobs scheduled as per the requirement of data load.</p> 
<p>CIF provides an event-based trigger approach where data is loaded as and when required. For each event triggered, entries are created in Live Cache of SAP APO system.</p>
<h1>SAP APO - Supply Chain Monitoring</h1>
<p><b>Supply Chain Monitoring</b> (SCM) is an effective tool to make informed decisions for the suppliers and the buyers. The key holders in supply chain process takes decisions based on Supply Chain Monitoring. Supply Chain consists of two tools &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Stock Requirement List MD04</li>
<li>Logistics Information System (LIS)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transaction MD04/Stock Requirement List</h2>
<p>In supply chain monitoring, all alerts raised in the system should be executed in a symmetrical way. When there are no alerts pending in the supply chain, it results in a healthy system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/material.jpg" alt="Material" />
<p>Enter Material and Plant in the above screenshot and click the tick mark on top of the page.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/tick_mark.jpg" alt="Tick Mark" />
<p>BOM for material was exploded. Enter Purchase requisition.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/purchase_requisition.jpg" alt="Purchase requisition" />
<p>Following activities can be monitored using Transaction MD04 &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Review master data alerts</li>
<li>Orders can be placed in lead time</li>
<li>Shortages</li>
<li>Overages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logistics Information System (LIS)</h2>
<p>SAP Supply Chain provides various standard reports that can be used to monitor the efficiency of the entire supply chain process. Logistics Information System (LIS) is used to mine the data for the following standard reports &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Vendor Performance</li>
<li>Sales Performance</li>
<li>Maintenance Cost</li>
<li>Rejection Rates</li>
<li>Manufacturing Lead Time</li>
</ul>
<p>Using LIS, you can not only evaluate actual data but you can also use it to prepare planning data.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Monitoring involves the following functions &minus;</p>
<h3>Alert Monitor</h3>
<p>Alert monitor is used to check if your application is running fine. In an Alert monitor, you can view all the alerts and navigate directly to the application. Alert monitor can also be used with SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM), and Forecasting and Replenishment.</p>
<p>Alert monitor is used to monitor objects in the Supply Chain - material, transportation and storage constraints, capacity as well as metrics such as delivery performance, cost flow, and throughput.</p>
<p>Transaction Code for Alert Monitor is <b>SAPAPO/AMON_SETTINGS</b> or you can also open using the following path - Easy Access &rarr; Advanced Planning and Optimization &rarr; Supply Chain Monitoring &rarr; Current Settings &rarr; Set Alert Monitor.</p>

<h1>SAP APO - Demand Planning</h1>
<p><b>Demand planning</b> allows to perform forecasting of products in the market. The output of demand planning process is the demand plan which considers all the factors that affects the demand. The demand planning process defines the activity in Demand Planning cycle. As the demand planning process takes place in the form of a cycle, certain activities can be repeated.</p>
<h2>Demand Planning Implementation</h2>
<p>The successful setup of the demand planning process includes setting up the planning area. You need to identify the key figures to be used for demand planning. Actual data for demand planning and historical planning data is stored in InfoCube and the current planning data is stored in live cache time series objects.</p> 
<p>In demand planning, you require a key figure for each department and business partner to create the forecast.</p> 
<p>For each key figure, you have to decide whether you will also need key figures for corrected history, corrected forecast, promotions, ex-post forecast, and/or ex-post MLR forecast. If key figures do not exist in the system, you can create them.</p>
<h2>Key Figures in Demand Planning</h2>
<p>In demand planning, it contains data represented as a numerical value. It can be a quantity or a monetary value. There are three type of key figures commonly used under demand planning &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Quantity (To represent physical quantities)</p></li>
<li><p>Amount (To represent amount of money)</p></li>
<li><p>Number (To represent numerical values)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To create key figures, navigate to SAP Easy Access &rarr; Demand Planning &rarr; Environment &rarr; Data Warehousing Workbench.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/data_warehousing_workbench.jpg" alt="Data Warehousing Workbench" />

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/info_object.jpg" alt="Info Object" />
<p>When creating a key figure for values, you have to select Amount and choose the data type "CURR". Enter the unit/currency "0STAT_CURR or 0Currency. For quantities, select "Quantity," choose the data type "QUAN", and enter the unit "0BASE_UOM or 0Unit.".</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/data_type_quan.jpg" alt="Data Type Quan" />
<p>You can also create characteristics, define characteristics to be used at the planning level, or only for selection. In the Administrative workbench, if APO standard characteristics already exists in the system - "AMATNR" for product and "9ALOCNO" for location.</p> 
<p>You can also create new characteristics by navigating to Edit &rarr; Objects &rarr; Edit InfoObjects in Administrative workbench.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_apo/images/characteristics.jpg" alt="Characteristics" />
<p>You can create the characteristics you want to use as planning levels and the characteristics that will be used for selection and navigation.</p>
<h2>Forecast Model Under Demand Planning</h2>

<h1>SAP APO - PP/DS</h1>
<p>In SAP APO, <b>Production Planning/Detailed Scheduling</b> (PP/DS) is used to generate procurement proposals to meet the production requirements. This component is also used for defining resource plan and order details. You can also plan for critical products to reduce the lead time and to improve time delivery performance.</p>
<p>PP/DS can be used to create executable plans and to achieve the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Improve the on-time delivery performance for critical products</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce lead times</p></li>
<li><p>Improve coordination between resources and better procurement process</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the stock cost</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PP/DS is integrated with other SAP APO components. For example, with demand planning to create a demand plan and to move PIR to PP/DS to create procurement proposals.</p> 
<p>Transaction and master data from the OLAP system is moved to APO and after order processing planning, results are moved to APO system.</p>
<h2>Integration of PP/DS with SAP APO applications</h2>
<p>Let us now discuss integration of PP/DS with SAP APO applications.</p>
<h3>Integration with Demand Planning</h3>
<p>Demand planning is used to meet the market demand for critical products after considering different factors and the result of demand planning is a demand plan. Demand plan is moved to PP/DS to raise procurement proposals for both external system and internal procurement process.</p>
<p>Using Demand Plan, demand planning is executed for customers and planned independent requirement results are transferred from DP to PP/DS to cover PIR by creating procurement proposals.</p>
<p>Following is the <b>Process Flow</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; First step is to start with the release of demand plan to Supply Network Planning. Demand plan can be released as mass processing or online.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Consider the release period same on PP/DS horizon and Supply Network Planning horizon.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Copy requirements to target planning version, resulting in a demand plan to Supply Network Planning, which in turn triggers an event in PP/DS for products.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Action takes place as per Planning Procedure for mentioned products.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Execution of PP/DS Planning.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Integration with SNP</h3>
<p>Supply Network Planning (SNP) ensures that product quantities are available at the right time, right place without overloading of resources in production and transportation process. SNP defines the quantities in which products should be procured, produced, or transported. PP/DS defines lot sizes of products to be procured, and sequences of planning order.</p> 
<p>Both the methods are integrated and planning is performed for different task distribution.</p>
<h3>Supply Network Planning and PP/DS Planning Tasks</h3>
<p>SNP and PP/DS are defined for different phases - SNP planning is used for medium-term objectives and short-term planning is for PP/DS. The horizon for SNP planning and PP/DS planning are same and the planning area doesn't overlap.</p>  
<p>When the same planning version is used for SNP and PP/DS, it is also possible to convert SNP orders into PP/DS orders.</p>
<h2>PP/DS Alert Monitoring</h2>
<p>You can monitor alerts raised in PP/DS planning using the Alert monitor. You need to define an alert profile relevant for to your planning.  Different alert types are created in PP/DS.</p>
<h3>Alerts Related to Relationship between Orders or Operations</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Dynamic pegging with date/time alerts</li>
