<h1>Talent Management - Introduction</h1>
<p>Talent means aptitude, skill, or the ability to perform a particular work or job. According to the lexicon of management, talent refers to identification, inculcation, utilization, and retention of a set of skills or abilities of the employees in the interest of the organization.</p>
<h2>What is Talent Management?</h2>
<p>Talent management is an integral part of human resource management. Talent management can be defined as a deliberate approach implemented to recruit or hire, develop and retain people with required aptitude or skills to meet the present and future goals or needs of the organization.</p>
<p>It is the creation and maintenance of a supportive and pro-people organizational culture. Talent management is, therefore, the commitment of an organization to recruit, develop, retain the most talented and qualitative employees available in the job market.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/introduction.jpg" alt="Introduction" />
<p>Talent management has become almost an inevitable management process in modern days. Due to tough competition in every sphere of business world today, organizations are vying for the best people from the job market.</p>
<p>However, attracting the best talent from the job market is not everyone’s cup of tea. It requires a lot of competence, expertise and experience on the part of the organization to recruit the best in the industry. Major part of the Human Resource Department is devoted to talent management, which is mostly dedicated to the purpose of recognizing, sourcing and poaching best talent.</p>
<h1>Talent Management - Importance</h1>
<p>Talent Management starts with identification of the appropriate skilled people required for the organization and then there is proper selection of people with requisite potentials and skills in desired job.</p>
<p>After identification and selection of the right kind of people, Talent Management implements competitive compensation that may include attractive pay-package, periodical increment, health insurance, paid leaves, etc. for the employees. The selected workforce is provided with training and regular refreshment programs so as to match the emerging requirements of the organization.</p>
<h2>Significance of Talent Management</h2>
<p>The basic purpose of talent management is to recruit, develop, and retain best talent in the organization. The HR Department always endeavors to ensure that employees with the right skills and qualities stay with the organization for a long time.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/importance.jpg" alt="Importance" />
<p>The most important functions of Talent Management are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Establishing a high-performance workforce.</p></li>
<li><p>Attracting individuals with high potential and retaining them through proper training and refreshment.</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing the productivity of the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper time management, as untrained and unskilled workforce lead to wastage of time and commitment of errors, which is not cost-effective.</p></li>
<li><p>Retain talented and high-performing employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring growth and innovation in the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing skills and competencies in employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A requisite pool of qualified and talented employees can simplify the process of achieving the organizational goal and help focus on issues that really matters in the interest of the organization. Therefore, the overall purpose of talent management is to maintain a skilled and efficient workforce for the organization.</p>
<p>In modern-day organizations, the importance of talent management is second to none. Unless an organization has the required talented workforce, it cannot succeed in attaining its goal even if it possesses other factors such as natural resources, infrastructure, and technology. In fact, it is people who take an organization to its next levels of success.</p>
<h1>Talent Management - Types</h1>
<p>Talent management includes within its fold those individuals who can make a difference to the organization’s goals, either through their immediate contribution or in the long run.</p>
<p>Talent is a composite state made up of various elements. An Individual is said to be talented when he/she possesses or acquires the following elements.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Skills, knowledge, intelligence, and experience</li>
<li>Ability to learn and grow</li>
<li>Judgment, attitude, character</li>
<li>Perseverance and self-motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>Talent is a set of unique abilities possessed by individuals. There are two types of talent found in an organization. They are <b>unidimensional</b> and <b>multidimensional</b>. Both types of talent have the same objective, however, with different perspectives.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/types.jpg" alt="Types" />
<h2>Unidimensional Talent</h2>
<p>In an organization, we observe that some employees are best in a particular skill and ability. For instance, some employee may be best in administration, some of them best in sales, while some employees may be best in their respective functions. When individuals possess a singular talent in any particular field, it is called unidimensional talent.</p>
<h2>Multidimensional Talent</h2>
<p>On the other hand, in an organization we also observe that employees are adept at multiple skills and abilities. For example, one employee is best in administration sales, accounting and production at a stretch. Such an employee is said to possess multi-dimensional talent.</p>
<p>Multi-dimensional talent is much sort after by organizations. Every organization seeks to retain employees with multidimensional talent as they prove highly beneficial in bridging the gap between organizational objectives and goals.</p>
<h2>Skill and Knowledge as Defined in Talent Management</h2>
<p>Skill and knowledge both are the abilities of individuals. Knowledge is information-based and skill is the ability to perform a particular task in the required time frame.</p>
<p><b>Knowledge</b> &minus; It is the theoretical and practical understanding of any subject. It provides the foundation to gain skills on any subject or action. For example, an employee having good knowledge of English language and grammar may not be able to speak in good English, because communicating in English is a distinct skill.</p>
<p><b>Skill</b> &minus; One can develop skills through experience, training, and continuous effort. For example, an employee can develop communication skills while continuously practicing and communicating with colleagues or subordinates.</p>
<h1>Talent Management - Talent Gap</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss what is talent gap and how the HR team applies the methods of Talent Management to fill this talent gap.</p>
<h2>What is Talent Gap?</h2>
<p>Talent gap simply refers to a lack of skilled personnel in an organization. Every organization occasionally faces the tough issue of talent gap. The HR Department makes an all-out effort to fill this gap through various methods, most of which are discussed in subsequent chapters of this tutorial.</p>
<p>Persistent talent gap is likely to hamper the growth and development of an organization. It also has a negative impact on the employees’ motivation as they feel demotivated due to lack of talented people to look up to for necessary instructions and advice to work effectively.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/talent_gap.jpg" alt="Talent Gap" />
<p>When an organization is fraught with talent gap, it performs rather poorly in every respect. This is when HR managers step in to fill the gap by recruiting talented people to work in the organization.</p>
<h2>How to Fill the Talent Gap?</h2>
<p>To fill the talent gap in an organization, the HR Department needs to follow certain basic steps. It helps in working out solutions to deal with talent gap. Following are the steps to address talent gap.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Know the Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) required for the positions or vacancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the areas where proficiency needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for persons with required KSAs within the industry or market.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the right or deserving candidates with required proficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the skill gap of the candidate to the position.</p></li>
<li><p>Devise plans to mitigate the skill gap.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide training and refreshment to the newly-hired employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Roll out professional development plans to help employees succeed in their role.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodical assessment of individual performance and identify the areas where extra training or specialized attention is required.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A continuous alignment between organizational needs and employees performance is essential in meeting the goals of an organization.</p>
<p>It is found that talent gap has a moderate-to-high negative effect on business. It also reduces competitiveness and productivity. It hampers the turnout rate and reduces employees’ morale in an organization.</p>
<p>The HRD needs to take strategic steps to reduce talent gap to a negligible level so as not hamper the productivity of the workforce.</p>
<h2>Strategies to Reduce Talent Gap</h2>
<p>Following are some of the strategies that can help reduce the talent gap in an organization &minus;</p>
<h3>Develop a Culture of Talent Development</h3>
<p>Culture is the environment for people at work. Every organization has its own culture. Culture in an organization includes the norms and behavior that outline its shared values. Managers need to build and maintain an effective culture for the larger interest of the organization.</p>
<p>Organizational culture should be so nurtured that it will facilitate to retain, sustain, and grow talent.</p>
<h3>Act as a Role Model</h3>
<p>Be transparent about your own needs to learn, develop and share. Embrace openness. Leaders are never more powerful than when they are shown to be learning.</p>
<h3>Reinforce the Value of Learning</h3>
<p>Go beyond the preliminary conversation about goals. Ask employees what they want to accomplish and what they feel their gaps are. When someone completes an assignment, celebrate both the outcome and the learning, especially if the assignment wasn't completed smoothly. Reinforce shared values.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/reinforce.jpg" alt="Reinforce" />
<h3>Build Sustainable Processes</h3>
<p>Managers should coach and develop their people. Every employee knows what areas they need to improve, and for those with particularly high potential, career tracks should be developed that give them a sense of a sustainable relationship with the organization.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Shared Values</h3>
<p>Every employee should be able to connect their daily work productivity and responsibilities to the values of the organization. They need to understand the job and the reason for completing the job successfully.</p>
<h3>Leverage Problems as Opportunities</h3>
<p>Problems in the workplace should be seen by employees as opportunities to develop their skills and hone their talent for future performance. Learning the causes and stresses inherent in the problems can be helpful for both the organization and the employees.</p>

<h1>Talent Management - 360 Degree Feedback</h1>
<p>360-Degree Feedback is a multi-rater feedback process in which an employee receives confidential but anonymous feedback from subordinates, peers, customers or clients, reporting managers or any other people who work around them. This is a kind of appraisal tool, which measures the performance of the employees.</p>
<p>The employee receives an analysis of how he or she perceives himself or herself and how he or she is perceived by others. The feedback forms include questions that are measured on a rating scale and also ask raters to provide comments.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/feedback.jpg" alt="Feedback" />
<p>The growing irrelevance of top-down performance reviews has led to more topdown/bottom-up assessments, and eventually to the 360-degree assessment.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, in this system of feedback, not only the superior but also the peers and every stakeholder of the organization evaluates and comments on the performance of the employees.</p>
<p>Following are some of the benefits of 360-degree feedback system &minus;</p>

<h2>Principles of 360-Degree Feedback</h2>
<p>As discussed earlier, 360-degree appraisal is a multi-rater and feedback system, widelyacknowledged appraisal model in the world today. The basic principles of this popular appraisal system are as follows.</p>

<li><p>The employee is assessed yearly or even half-yearly by a series of assessors such as the manager, immediate subordinates, peers, and internal and external customers.</p></li>
<li><p>The aforesaid assessment is carried on with a questionnaire, which is specially designed to assess behavior critical for performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The assessment is consolidated and feedback profiles are prepared and shared with every participant either by the HR manager or the department in a performance review session.</p></li>
<li><p>It is powerful, accurate, and reliable compared with the tradition feedback system as it conducts an impartial and objective assessment. It also involves all those who are related to the targeted employees.</p></li>
<li><p>It addresses various skills such as resource management and goal setting. It is multi-dimensional.</p></li>
<li><p>It also emphasizes subjective aspects such as teamwork, leadership qualities, and overall character.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>360-degree feedback answers the following questions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Why should I improve my performance?</li>
<li>What do I need to improve?</li>
<li>How can I improve?</li>
</ul>

It first became popular as 360degree appraisal system in the US and today a large number of <i>Fortune 500</i> organizations are using this non-conventional appraisal measure in some form or the other.</p>
<h1>Talent Management - Calibration</h1>
<p>Calibration is the process or method of establishing an accepted and judicious standard by which overall employee performance is measured by taking away the impression of having biased and unfair reviews.</p>
<p>The objective of calibration sessions is to ensure that different managers apply similar standards in measuring and evaluating the performance of subordinates. In the words of Grote, “Calibration is to ensure a level playing field by neutralizing the effect of ‘tough graders’ and ‘easy graders’ on performance appraisal ratings.”</p>
<p>Calibration makes it easier for managers to deliver honest but negative performance appraisals. It also has the benefit of exposing talented employees to a larger number of senior leaders.</p>
<p>Calibration is a simple and well-structured appraisal system for performance evaluation.</p>

<h1>Succession &amp; Career Planning</h1>
<p>Succession planning is having in place measures to identify and develop potential successors for key or strategic posts in an organization. It is different from replacement planning which grades employees on the basis of their past performance. Succession planning nurtures future talent to lead the organization.</p>
<p>Career planning, on the other hand, is done for all positions in the organization. However, both succession and career planning are an integral part of career management policy.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/career.jpg" alt="Career" />
<p>Succession and career planning is the process of identifying, nurturing, developing, and training new leaders for future requirements or replacement of the existing leaders to continue the trend of dependable leadership in the organization.</p>
<p>Following are the stages to follow to ensure fruitful succession and career planning &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Identify the Critical Position</b> &minus; Organization should always keep a watch on what are the key elements or contributors to their business, how to motivate and retain talent, and what will be the next step if the main contributors leave the organization due to any reason. Who are the specialized people to perform the critical role?</p></li>
<li><p><b>Analysis</b> &minus; This stage tells about the requirements to fill with a fit successor. What are the gaps? What are the internal and external sources to fill the gaps, what will be the strategy? What will be the competencies required?</p></li>
<li><p><b>Development of Succession and Career Plan</b> &minus; It is also called as backup plan to streamline the function of the organization. It identifies the requirements and outlines a strategy to fill the gap and make sure that functions are being performed well.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Evaluate, Monitor, and Observe</b> &minus; This is the process of evaluation. It involves constant monitoring, even after the gap or requirement is fulfilled. Performance is observed to find out if any changes are required. In case if any changes are required, quick action is taken.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Roadblocks to Succession and Career Planning</h2>
<p>Organizations have to face many barriers while implementing succession and career planning. Following is the list of roadblocks &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Delay in planning</li>
<li>Dividing the business equally among partners</li>
<li>Trusting the inheritor</li>
<li>Being secretive about the plan</li>
<li>Fearing your retirement years</li>
<li>Not having a potential successor</li>
<li>Assuming that a family member will take over the business</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcoming Roadblocks in Succession and Career Planning</h2>
<p>An organization needs to invest the required time in performance review as a major part of succession and career planning. Lack of time is a major roadblock to succession and career planning.</p>
<p>Managers consider such investment of time as not being an effective use of time. However, without performance review system, employee contribution becomes impossible to measure. It is also desirable to have a suitable organizational culture to promote impartiality and integrity in designing succession and career planning in the organization.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Let us consider, XYZ Company plans to groom and develop the key elements or employees in critical position in the organization, to identify successors and fill the required gaps. For this, they divided the skill into <b>60-25-15 model</b>, to check the criticality of the position and make plans to overcome the problems that arise in future.

<h1>Talent Management - Employee Engagement</h1>
<p>Keeping employees engaged is one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations nowadays. It is also a huge opportunity to gain long-term commitment and mandatory effort from a team. This effort will ultimately lead to higher sales and fewer mistakes in an organization.</p>
<p>From the day an employee joins an organization, his or her positive engagement or fruitful involvement in organizational work becomes a tough responsibility of the management. Before allotting duties and responsibilities to newly appointed employees, the organization clarifies itself about its goals and places the employee at the right place to materialize the goals. It decides and understands what and how of the goals.</p>
<p>Hence, it is an important HR function to define and plan an employee engagement strategy that aligns with the organization’s goals.</p>
<h2>What is Employee Engagement?</h2>
<p>Employee engagement or keeping employees engaged refers to the manner in which employees give their best of individual and group effort in the interest of the organization. The approach of employee engagement keeps employees committed towards  organizational goals and values. It keeps them motivated to give their best contribution to the success of the organization.</p>
<p>The integral parts of a business are organization, employees, leadership, and customers. A healthy and progressive cohesion and interaction among these parts is a necessary precondition for achieving organizational goals. It is based upon the notion of ‘One for All’ and ‘All for One’. There is interaction and interdependence among these parts.</p>
<p>Organization comprises of employees; employees provide effective leadership which leads to increased productivity and efficiency, as well as effective customer satisfaction. This, in turn, leads to growth and development of the organization.</p>
<h2>Categories of Employee Engagement</h2>
<p>Every business or organization inextricably wants to have higher retention rate, productivity, and reduced absenteeism. Hence, it seeks continuous employee engagement. Employee engagement can be broadly divided into four categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Actively Engaged</b> &minus; Employees belonging to this category are highly motivated and work with great passion, and feel a profound connection to their organization. They are used to work towards the vision of the organization, and contribute their ideas towards innovation and creativity for the success of the organization. They are passionate, innovative, and constructive in their work to the organization. They perform consistently at high level.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Actively Disengaged</b> &minus; Employees belonging to this category aren’t just unhappy at work; they are also busy exhibiting their unhappiness. They disperse negative energy into the organization, causing severe damage to the organization. However, they are likely to serve the organization for a longer time but will always try to undermine what their engaged coworkers accomplish.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Not Engaged</b> &minus; A considerable percentage of employees in an organization belong to this category. They lack passion and drive and are seldom concerned for the betterment of the organization. They are used to focus on the task rather than goal or vision of the company. They do the work what is told or according to the instruction. They won’t contribute ideas, creativity, or innovation. They might be positive or negative. They are not proactive.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Employee Engagement Process</h1>
<p>As said earlier, employee engagement is pivotal to the sustenance and growth of the organization. Every successful organization understands the importance of effective employee engagement. Employees engross themselves in work when they feel that they are doing meaningful work and what they do makes a difference.</p>
<p>Truly engaged employees put their heart and soul into their jobs and have passion and excitement to give more than what is desired from them. In the absence of employee engagement, organizations suffer loss and negative clientele response.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/employee_engagement_process.jpg" alt="Employee Engagement Process" />
<h2>Ways to Secure Desirable Employee Engagement</h2>
<p>To combat employee disengagement, an organization needs to have certain principles or ways.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>A supportive organizational culture</b> &minus; An organization leaves no stone unturned in keeping continuous employee engagement. It needs to create a culture that fosters engaged employees. A supportive organizational culture works as a major attraction for the employees to join.</p></li>
<li><p><b>A vision to reckon with</b> &minus; An organization should have a well-defined, well-communicated and strong vision which attracts and encourages employees to work for it. The vision needs to be shared with the employees in the organization by the leaders or management across the organization. The vision when communicated keeps the employees emotionally attached to it. As a result, the employees remain committed and loyal to the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Effective communication</b> &minus; Organization is a place where an employee spends a good portion of their life. Good and effective communication channels are thus helpful in fostering employee engagement within an organization. Employees are interested to know how the organization is doing on financial, social, and goal-achievement fronts. The immediate boss or the team manager should be easily accessible to the employees.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Employee development</b> &minus; Every employee in the organization wants to grow in terms of salary, perks, and position. They always seek opportunity to grow within the organization. Line managers or team leaders have some responsibility to groom or develop the team members through appropriate training and knowledge upgrade frequently.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reward and recognition</b> &minus; Reward, recognition and appreciation are the things used to increase the motivation level of employees. Employees get a feeling of their effort being validated and acknowledged by the superiors. They feel to be a valuable part of the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Employee satisfaction</b> &minus; Employees feel satisfied when they are considered as part of the process, their opinion gets valued, and they are on the forefront to achieve the desired goals. Organizations should solicit the employee’s feedback, ideas, and thought process as employee satisfaction leads to increased production and profitability.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Competitive pay and benefits</b> &minus; Offering viable compensation, benefits, good incentive plans, proper working condition, and flexibility are the necessary preconditions for strong employee engagement.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Talent Management - Coaching</h1>
<p>Talent Management is not solely meant for enhancing and retaining the talent of a few special people within the organization. It is about maximizing everyone’s strengths, championing diversity, and encouraging creativity and innovation. It aims at creating a work environment where the organization resounds with energy, drive, and passion of befitting employees.</p>
<p>Talent or skills are not a constant variable; rather, they are continuously nurtured, upgraded, and retained. Hence, there is a need for coaching and training to keep a viable talent culture across the organization.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/coaching.jpg" alt="Coaching" />
<p>What coaching means in the context of organizational talent management is counseling and receiving feedback as to the performance of employees. Coaching in an organization focuses on supporting an employee either as an individual or as a part of a group to enable him/her to give their best performance.</p>

<li><p>Various incentive schemes for employees should be introduced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Expectancy Theory in Talent Management</h2>
<p>Expectancy Theory explains the process of how an individual processes different motivational elements. Expectancy theory is a motivation theory which was first proposed by <b>Victor Vroom</b> of the Yale School of Management.</p>
<p>Vroom’s Expectancy Theory assumes that behavior is a product of conscious choices among available alternatives whose intent is to maximize profits or pleasure, and minimize loss or pain.</p>
<p>Vroom believed that individual factors of an employee such as personality, skills, knowledge, experience, and mettles influence his/her performances. He stated that effort, performance and motivation are linked in a person's motivation. He uses the variables Expectancy, Instrumentality and Valence to account for this.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/expectancy_theory.jpg" alt="Expectancy Theory" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Expectancy</b> &minus; The belief that increased effort leads to increased performance forms the basis of expectation. It is affected by many factors such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Availability of resources and time required for the job</p></li>
<li><p>Possessing such qualities and skills that are required for achieving the objective of the job</p></li>
<li><p>Availing required managerial and technical support to carry out the job</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Instrumentality</b> &minus; It is an objective analysis of the job undertaken. It is based on the idea that if you perform extremely well, a valued outcome will be received. To be objective and particular about the outcome one needs to have a clear understanding of the relationship between one’s performance and its outcome. Employees should have trust in the people they work with. Transparency of the process determines the outcome.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Valence</b> &minus; It refers to the emotional orientation which employees hold with respect to outcomes or rewards for the job done. The depth of the want of an employee for extrinsic (salary, promotion, free time, benefits) or intrinsic (satisfaction) rewards. Management must unearth what employees appreciate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The three elements are important behind choosing one element over another because they are clearly defined: effort-performance expectancy (E&gt;P expectancy) and performanceoutcome expectancy (P&gt;O expectancy).</p>
<h2>Object Oriented Theory in Talent Management</h2>
<p>Different people with differing mindsets behave differently to different situations, be it in an organization or in the society. Many people are quite objective in their approach to any work. They work better, when they have some concrete facts in front of them i.e., what to do and what not to do. Upon this basis, the object oriented theory thrives.</p>
<p>Object-oriented approach requires rigorous process to do the right thing. It is a new way to think about organizational problems based on real work concept. The basic construct is an object, which combines both data structure and behavior.</p>
<p><b>What is object?</b> It is the key to understand object oriented theory. Object can be anything such as employees in the organization, computer, machine, it is called as bundles of variable to and related method.</p>
<p><b>Message</b> &minus; It is one kind of media to pass the information between objects.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/talent_management/images/object_oriented_theory.jpg" alt="Object Oriented Theory" />
<p>Object oriented theory shows that, there should be a proper communication channel between employees and top management so that they can share ideas, knowledge and their problem with the management.</p>
<p>Talent management is a never-ending process that requires continuous effort. It is not restricted to recruiting the right and qualified candidates at the right time and in the right job. It also involves exploring the hidden and extraordinary qualities of the employees and developing and nurturing them to get an expected outcome. Retaining the best talent in an organization is as big a concern as hiring and metamorphosing them into loyal and dedicated workforce.</p>
