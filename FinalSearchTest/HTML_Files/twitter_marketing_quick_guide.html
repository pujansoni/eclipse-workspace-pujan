<h1>Twitter Marketing - Overview</h1>
<p>Today, social media is not only helping people to maintain their relations but also promote their businesses, views, grievances, or ideas.</p>
<p>Twitter is one of its kind that works on building fraternities of people sharing same or allied business industries and interests, running a campaign for marketing a business, which is far beyond maintaining one’s personal relationships.</p>
<h2>What is Twitter?</h2>
<p>Twitter is a social platform for sharing one’s views. The users can open their account with Twitter and broadcast their views in the form of short messages. These messages are popularly known as <b><i>Tweets</i></b>.</p>
<p>The registered users can write and publish their Tweets. The unregistered users can only see others’ Tweets by following them. The people who follow you can see your Tweets in their list called <b><i>Twitter Stream</i></b>. It is not necessary to follow back a person who is following you.</p>
<h2>How Can I Use Twitter for Marketing?</h2>
<p>Twitter visitors often visit Twitter out of the motivation to know what is happening in the world overall or with respect to a particular subject. With hundreds of millions of users and over 500 million Tweets being sent each day, there is a great opportunity for businesses to reach a global audience of new and existing customers through Twitter.</p>
<p>Conversations on Twitter are just like the face-to-face encounters you have with customers each day. Compelling content helps you attract new followers and keep them engaged over time, building awareness of your brand, and asserting yourself or brand as an authority in your industry or niche.</p>

<h1>Twitter Marketing - Account and Profile</h1>
<p>Twitter being a social media platform can bring you enormous opportunities and potential to connect to the people. On this platform you can share what you want the world to see and want. Let us see how to create twitter account and manage the profile.</p>
<h2>Creating a Twitter Account</h2>
<p>To get started, first you’ll need to create an account and set up a profile.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Go to the Twitter homepage.</p></li>
<li><p>Locate the sign up box, which will lead you directly to the signup page.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter your name, email address, and preferred password.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Sign Up</i></b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips on Selecting a Username</h2>
<p>When selecting a username, keep these simple tips in mind &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Use a relevant name. Your Twitter name should be relevant to your name or your company's name.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it short. The more characters that you use in your username, the less text characters will be used in Tweets directed to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Be unique.</p></li>
<li><p>Make your username easy to remember.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/join_twitter.jpg" alt="Join Twitter" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can tie only one email address to one Twitter account. A new page will come appear asking you to select a username.</p>
<h2>Twitter Account Profile</h2>
<p>Your Twitter profile shows the world who you are. It’s the first thing the audience will see when they connect with you on Twitter, so it’s important to make sure you get it right. The process below outlines the steps to create a Twitter business page to drive customers to your profile.</p>
<p>Every element of your profile &minus; your photo, header bio and pinned Tweet (optional) &minus; should reflect your business identity and branding. This is your opportunity to showcase your best work.</p>
<p>When designing your profile, view it as a business card. You have little space to put your most important information and make a lasting impact amongst the other online noise.</p>
<h2>Twitter Account Profile Elements</h2>
<p>Your Twitter account and profile is composed of these basic elements &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Username</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>URL for Primary Website</li>
<li>Brief Bio</li>
<li>Profile Image Thumbnail - also known as an avatar</li>
<li>Cover Image</li>
<li>Background, Theme and Design</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/account.jpg" alt="Account" />
<p><b>Let’s explore more.</b></p>
<p>Under the <b><i>Account</i></b> tab, your username and email address will already be created. Now it’s time to ensure the time zone is accurately represented. Timestamps are applied to all of your Tweets, so this is an important step not to overlook.</p>
<p>In the <b><i>More Info URL</i></b> field, you’ll want to put the primary website that you’d like to direct visitors of your Twitter profile to if they would like to learn more about you or your brand. Typically, this is a primary business website, but it could also be a Facebook page, LinkedIn page, or a custom page created just for your Twitter audience.</p>
<p>You’ll use the <b><i>One Line Bio</i></b> field to summarize yourself and your brand to the twitter audience in 160 characters or less. This can be edited at any time. It can be a straight-forward description, or an opportunity to show some of the personality that you want others to understand about your brand. Many recommend using keywords and hashtags in the profile to increase the number of people who find you when they search on Twitter.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Location</i></b> field can be set to be as specific as you like. This is not only information that your Twitter friends (“tweeps”) will associate with your brand, but search engines will also identify you via this geographic designation. You can opt to not disclose a geographic area, designate a country, state, or city. Alternatively, you can set up Twitter on your mobile device to track your specific GPS location so that your profile location will update to where you are.</p>
<h2>Tips on Creating a Twitter Marketing Profile</h2>
<p>Here are few important tips to follow while creating your marketing profile &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Be sure to consider your marketing goals with Twitter when setting the location and choose the most appropriate setting for your audience.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also choose to <b><i>Choose to Show my Vine Profile</i></b> on your Twitter profile (This feature is available only if you've connected your Twitter account to your Vine account).</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t protect your updates. What’s the point in being on Twitter if people have to jump through hoops to follow you? It completely runs counter to the spirit of community. If you don’t want people to see your Tweets, maybe you should stick to LinkedIn and Facebook where your connections are typically your friends/associates in the real world.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Twitter Profile Visuals</h2>
<p>Now let’s consider the visuals of your Twitter profile. A picture is worth a thousand words and on Twitter. On a social media channel where character count is limited, pictures are of the highest value. Many consider your profile image to be as important as your username on Twitter. The fact is that anyone on Twitter can see your profile image regardless of whether your profile is set to public or not.</p>
<p>You can select to use a headshot image, scenery, or a logo, although most agree that images including your personal image tends to be most well received on Twitter. Furthermore, those headshot images that have someone smiling receive more engagement.</p>
<img src="images/headshot_image.jpg" alt="Headshot Image" />
<p>Here are few recommendations on dimensions of profile images &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Header photo (1500x500 pixels)</p></li>
<li><p>Profile photo (400x400 pixels)</p></li>
<li><p>Theme color (only editable on twitter.com)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can customize the way your Twitter should look to you and to others. Under <b><i>Settings &rarr; Design</i></b> option, you can get to see the following detailed options &minus;</p>
<img src="images/design.jpg" alt="Design" />
<p>Other than your theme color, your design theme will not be visible on your profile or Home timeline.</p>
<h2>Customizing a Twitter Profile</h2>
<p>If you want to upload your own background image or customize the color scheme of your Tweet detail page, follow the steps below.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sign in to your Twitter account.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <b><i>Settings</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <b><i>Design</i></b> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down to the Customize your own section.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Change background</i></b> to upload a background image.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the box to Tile background if you want the selected picture to repeat across the background.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the Background position from left, center, or right.</p></li>
<li><p>If the image isn't very large, choose the background color that will show behind the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a theme color</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Save changes</i></b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Images justify to the top left of the screen. You cannot stretch your image to fit. It will display as the size you uploaded file must be smaller than 2MB.</p>
<h2>Customizing a Twitter Profile with Premade Theme</h2>
<p>This is how it goes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sign in to your Twitter account.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <b><i>Settings</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <b><i>Design</i></b> tab.</p></li>

<li><p>Select a premade theme of your choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Save changes</i></b> at the bottom of the page when you're done.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It's as simple as that!</p>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - The Followers</h1>
<p>Because everything shared on Twitter remains in the public domain, technically everyone has a voice and can be found on Twitter. However, it’s by curating the right followers you actually get heard by the mass audience.</p>
<p>Like any friendship, a good relationship on Twitter is earned by participating in conversations, substantive information, and giving back to the community. Although it’s easy to get wrapped in the numbers of how many followers you have, this is really an opportunity where oftentimes quality can outrank quantity.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that there can be many motives for participating in the Twitter community - to socialize, network, debate, learn, enrich, promote, and entertain. Most probably engage for many of these reasons.</p>
<h2>Components of Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter consists of three components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You</p></li>
<li><p>Your followers (those who follow you)</p></li>
<li><p>Your following (those whom you follow)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why am I on Twitter?</h2>
<p>An obvious question a twitter account holder often tackles is, why am I on Twitter? The best way to figure out how to search is by defining some keywords that define the type of Twitter user you’d like to engage with. These keywords should be those that you’d use in the content of a Tweet or that you would hope those that would read your Twitter content to be interested in.</p>
<p>With these keywords, it’s time to start searching for <b><i>Tweeps</i></b> (Twitter-friends) that are already chatting about these topics.</p>
<img src="images/tweeps.jpg" alt="Tweeps" />
<p>After typing in your keywords into the search bar, Tweets will pop in search results in chronological order.</p>
<p>Note, that under the <b><i>More Options</i></b> tab, you will have the opportunity to <b><i>Save this Search</i></b> for convenience.</p>
<p>From here you have the opportunity to review the content, and if relevant to learn more about the user that shared the Tweet. Like what you see? Click on <b><i>Follow</i></b>.</p>
<img src="images/follow.jpg" alt="Follow" />
<p>Depending on how specialized your marketing needs are and your industry niche, screening potential Twitter Tweeps may be a non-discriminatory process to collect a higher number of followers, or you may be quite selective to create a highly curated, active, and engaging audience.</p>
<h2>Considerations to Follow Others on Twitter</h2>
<p>The considerations when selecting those to follow (and things that others are looking at when they consider following you) are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Does their bio indicate common interests?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the ratio of followers versus following? Those with tons of followers but are following few are less likely to follow you back.</p></li>
<li><p>How recent are their Tweets and are they Tweeting often?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything from a recent Tweet in their feed that you can comment to and engage with?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you like the answers to the questions, start making friends… Click on <b><i>Follow</i></b>.</p>
<p>Twitter will allow you to follow up to 2,000 people with no limits. After you reach this milestone, however, you have to get a certain number of those to follow you back before your following limit is increased.</p>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Plain Tweets</h1>
<p>Attracting followers is harder than following on Twitter. The best place to start, however, is
by jumping in the conversation. Those who Tweet more have more followers. But not just because of the sheer number of Tweets they send – but the content quality matters.</p>
<img src="images/content_quality_matters.jpg" alt="Content Quality Matters" />
<img src="images/tweets_they_send.jpg" alt="Tweets they Send" />
<h2>Sending a Tweet from Twitter</h2>
<p>As found on Twitter.com, to send a basic Tweet, follow the given steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sign in to your Twitter account.</p></li>
<li><p>Type your Tweet into the textbox at the top of your Home timeline. Optionally, click on Tweet button in the top navigation bar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure your update is fewer than 140 characters. Twitter counts them for you. Remaining characters are shown as a number below the textbox.</p>
<p>Click on <b><i>Tweet</i></b> button to post the Tweet to your profile. You will immediately see your Tweet
in the timeline on your homepage.</p>
<h2>Deleting a Tweet</h2>
<p>Make a mistake? Twitter can help you delete a Tweet you sent &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sign in to your Twitter account.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit your Profile page.</p></li>
<li><p>Locate the Tweet you want to delete.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the More icon (•••).</p></li>
<li><p>Click Delete Tweet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Done! Your Tweet has been deleted.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You cannot delete a Tweet sent by an account that you do not own.</p>
<p>A few vital points as you start&minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you receive a Tweet, reply back.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind what your twitter feed looks like. Just like any other social media channel, you want to make sure that what you are sharing en-suite reflects your marketing needs and strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are sharing a content from another source, be sure to include the twitter handle of the content owner. Not only will they appreciate knowing that you shared their content, they might even thank you for it and follow you back!</p></li>
<li><p>Leave room for extra characters. Sure, you have 140 characters to use, but you might want to spare a few. Leaving extra characters at the end of your Tweet will enable others to retweet your content without having to edit it.</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of hashtags. They help search, but using too many hashtags can also be seen as spam.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Image &amp; Video Posts</h1>
<p>Everyone present on the Internet knows that images and videos take us closer to the real life experience than mere textual contents. Images and videos are a great way to draw attention to the content you share on Twitter and are very easy to insert into your Tweets. Let us see, how &minus;</p>
<img src="images/compose_new_tweet.jpg" alt="Compose New Tweet" />
<h2>Sharing Images on Twitter</h2>
<p>To share images and videos from Twitter, follow the given steps &minus;</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Ensure that your Tweet has enough characters to allow for the photo you are adding.</p>
<p>When you add a photo, a shortened website link appears in your Tweet that your followers can click to see your photo. The website link for your photo will use a portion of the 140 characters allowed for a Tweet. If the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Your-Word-Count-when-Tweeting-from-wikiHow">character count</a> for your Tweet is below 0 after adding your photo, shorten the characters so the link for your photo will be displayed in the Tweet completely.</p>

<h2>Twitter Video Posts</h2>
<p>Twitter enables you to use videos to tell your story in real-life manner. By posting videos, you can connect to large audience and gradually grow it further. Twitter allots 30 seconds to capture a video as that is the best long a video should be. If it extends more than 30 seconds, it is observed that the audience loses its interest and might discontinue viewing it.</p>

<h1>Twitter Marketing - Embeddable Tweets</h1>
<p>An embedded Tweet can display photos and videos uploaded to Twitter as well as content described by a link. By embedding a Tweet to your website or blog, you can display a fully functional Tweet or <b><i>Twitter thread</i></b> for users to interact with.</p>
<p>You can take the following steps according to Twitter.com to embed a Tweet on your website &minus;</p>
<img src="images/twitter_thread.jpg" alt="Twitter Thread" />
<ul class="list">

<p>Copy and paste the code provided into your blog or website.</p>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Hashtags</h1>
<p>The <b>#</b> symbol, called a hashtag, is used to mark keywords or topics in a Tweet. It was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages. People use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase (no spaces) in their Tweet to categorize those Tweets and help them show more easily in Twitter Search. Clicking on a <b><i>hashtagged</i></b> word in any message shows you all other Tweets marked with that keyword.</p>
<p>Hashtags can occur anywhere in the Tweet – at the beginning, middle, or end; and can even become trending topics on Twitter.</p>
<h2>Considerations of Using Hashtags in Twitter</h2>
<p>A few key points regarding hashtags are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you Tweet with a hashtag on a public account, anyone who does a search for that hashtag may find your Tweet.</p></li>

<li><p>Use hashtags only on Tweets relevant to the topic.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/media_marketing.jpg" alt="Media Marketing" />
<h2>Types of Twitter Hashtags</h2>
<p>There are the following prominent types and ways of using the hashtags &minus;</p>
<h3>Brand Hashtags</h3>
<p>Brand hashtags can be created to represent your brand consistently on Twitter. You’ll always use the same hashtag no matter what you are promoting. You create your own brand hashtag. Make it your company name, or a tagline that people know (or will know) about your business. Use it as your central business tag, that you - and your customers - can use anytime, and on any social site.</p>
<h3>Campaign Hashtags</h3>
<p>Campaign hashtags are used for each of your marketing campaigns and will have a relative short lifespan. For a campaign tag, make it a word or phrase that is unique to your shortterm contest or promotion</p>
<h3>Trending Hashtags</h3>
<p>A trending hashtag is nothing but a very popular hashtag topic. You probably know people talking about <b><i>What’s trending now?</i></b>; means they are referring to the hashtags that are the most talked about right now.</p>
<p>Trending hashtags are changed continuously in real time. For example, a top 10 trends can set and vanish within minutes. When you see your business related trend, you can engage in it by using this tag.</p>
<h3>Content Hashtags</h3>
<p>These are the hashtags you can use in your posts. They are not branded and they are not used to define your business or marketing. They may or may not be trending. Content hashtags improve the SEO of your posts.</p>
<h3>Event Hashtags</h3>
<p>Event-based hashtags can be cool to include in a content update. An event could be anything from a local community fair, to a well-known global celebration, to a live product launch or a live webinar you’re hosting online.</p>
<h3>Location hashtags</h3>
<p>If you are a locally based business, you need to connect with your local customers. Use specific geo-targeted hashtags to get your business known in your city.</p>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Retweets</h1>
<p>A retweet is a simple way to re-post someone else's Tweet. By retweeting, you can share another user's content to your followers and the Twitter community at large.</p>
<p>There is no limit for the number of retweets a single Tweet can have, however, Twitter will only display the most recent 100 retweets. Also, retweets are counted against a user's 1,000 Tweet per day limit.</p>
<img src="images/b2k_media.jpg" alt="B2KMedia" />
<h2>How to Recognize Re-Tweets?</h2>
<p>According to Twitter.com &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Retweets look like normal Tweets with the author's name and username next to it, but are distinguished by the Retweet icon and the name of the user who retweeted the Tweet. If you see a message from a stranger in your timeline, look for retweeted by info in the Tweet — the retweeter should be someone you follow</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes people type RT at the beginning of a Tweet to indicate that they are reposting someone else's content. This isn't an official Twitter command or feature, but signifies that they are quoting another user's Tweet.</p></li>
<li><p>Retweets may appear differently in third-party applications, and will show up in apps only if they are using Twitter's Retweet API. Many apps have built in their own version of retweeting — those Tweets are not treated as official Retweets on Twitter. To test, try retweeting from your favorite app, then check your profile on the web.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Where do Retweets Appear?</h2>
<p>Here is where you can get to see the different tweets &minus;</p>
<h3>Tweets Retweeted by Your Followers</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can see Retweets your followers have retweeted in your <b><i>Home timeline</i></b>.</p></li>

</ul>
<h2>Tweets that You Retweeted</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you retweet someone you follow, it will be visible on your profile timeline.</p></li>
<li><p>If you retweet someone you do not follow, it will be visible on both your home and profile timelines.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/you_retweeted.jpg" alt="You Retweeted" />
<h3>Your Tweets that Others Retweeted</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Go to <b>Notifications</b> in the top navigation bar. In the Notifications section you will see all activity concerning your Tweets — including which have recently been retweeted and by whom</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/others_retweeted.jpg" alt="Others Retweeted" />
<h3>Turning Retweets Off</h3>
<p>You can turn off <b><i>Retweets</i></b> for a specific user if you don’t like what they share.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Select <b><i>Turn off Retweets</i></b> from the gear icon drop-down menu on a user's profile.</p></li>
<li><p>Turning Retweets on or off is not retroactive; means you can't remove Retweets that are already in your timeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is not possible to turn off ALL Retweets from ALL users.</p>
<img src="images/retweeted.jpg" alt="Retweeted" />
<h2>Undoing or Deleting Retweets</h2>
<p>You can undo a Retweet you've made by clicking on <b><i>Retweeted</i></b> in the Tweet. This will remove the retweet from your timeline, but will not delete the original Tweet.</p>
<h2>Why Can't Some Tweets be Retweeted?</h2>
<p>Here are some reasons why some tweets can’t be retweeted &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If another user's Tweets are <b><i>protected</i></b>, you will not be able to retweet their content. If you see the <b><i>Lock icon</i></b> next to the user's name and information on their profile page or on their Tweets, their Tweets are protected and you will not be able to share their Tweets on your timeline through Twitter's Retweet feature.</p></li>
<li><p>You can see their Tweets in your timeline because they have accepted your follow request, but because they have chosen not to share their Tweets publicly, their Tweets cannot be retweeted by you or anyone else.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot retweet your own Tweet. However, if your Tweets are public, others will be able to retweet you.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Lists</h1>
<p>A <b><i>List</i></b> on Twitter is a compiled group of Twitter users. With Twitter List, you can create personalized lists or subscribe to the lists composed by other users. When viewing a Twitter List, you will only be able to see a stream of posts from those users added to the specific Twitter List.</p>
<p>Twitter Lists are only used for reading Tweets. According to Twitter.com, you cannot send or direct a Tweet to members of a list, for only those list members to see.</p>

<h1>Twitter Marketing - Useful Features</h1>
<p>Twitter provides a wide range of useful features, which can be used for business marketing. In this chapter you get to understand purpose of creating multiple Twitter accounts for business, pinning on Twitter, posting links through the tweets, and the URL shorteners.</p>
<h2>Multiple Twitter Accounts</h2>
<p>A best practice for Twitter as a brand is maintaining one go-to Twitter account. However, some brands may need to create multiple Twitter accounts to address several geographical locations, hone in on certain business channels/departments, tweeting only to employees versus consumer.</p>
<p>When managing multiple Twitter accounts, we recommend using <b><i>Hootsuite</i></b> to post and monitor Twitter activity. This free web based product lets you schedule your Twitter posts ahead of time or Tweet live (attach a URL and a photo as well), monitor the stream of those you are following, as well as monitor specific hashtags, keywords, and handles.</p>
<h2>Tweet Pinning</h2>
<p>Twitter lets you "Pin" a Tweet that stays at the top of your stream. When people visit your profile, they see the pinned Tweet first.</p>
<h3>Pinning a Tweet on Twitter</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Visit your Twitter profile page.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a Tweet you want to pin.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the three-dot icon that appears at the bottom of the Tweet next to the <b><i>favorites</i></b> count.</p></li>
<li><p>From the drop-down menu, select <b><i>Pin to your profile page</i></b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you refresh the page, your pinned Tweet should appear at the top, above your most recent Tweets.</p>
<h3>Unpinning a Tweet on Twitter</h3>
<p>To unpin the Tweet, you can click on the same three-dot icon and choose <b><i>Unpin</i></b> or you can pin a new Tweet, replacing the previously pinned Tweet.</p>
<img src="images/unpin.jpg" alt="Unpin" />
<p>Pinned Tweets cannot be seen when using Twitter on mobile phones.</p>
<h2>URL Shorteners in Twitter</h2>
<p>Links shared on Twitter, including links shared in Direct Messages, will automatically be processed and shortened to an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://t.co/">http://t.co</a> link.</p>
<p>Shortened links allow you to share long URLs in a Tweet while maintaining the maximum number of characters for your message. By creating this unique link for twitter, you can measures information such as how many times a link has been clicked, an important quality signal in determining how relevant and interesting each Tweet is when compared to similar Tweets.</p>
<p>Unless using a third-party, all URL’s will be shortened as a t.co link. You cannot opt out of link shortening.</p>
<h2>Posting Links in a Tweet</h2>
<p>You can post a link in a Tweet on the Internet using Tweet Box or from your mobile device.</p>
<h3>Tweeting a Link on Internet</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Sign in to your Twitter account.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Tweet</i></b> button.</p></li>
<li><p>Type or paste the URL into the Tweet box.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A URL of any length will be altered to 23 characters, even if the link itself is less than 23 characters long. Your character count reflects this. Click on <b><i>Tweet</i></b> button to post your Tweet and link.</p>
<h3>Tweeting a Link from a Mobile Device</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Open your preferred mobile app, or begin a new text message.</p></li>
<li><p>Type or paste the URL into your Tweet. Links will be adjusted with Twitter's link shortener wherever you post them. Some clients will adjust your character count as you compose a Tweet; some won't.</p></li>
<li><p>Post the Tweet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other popular link shorterner services include <b><i>bit.ly</i></b> and Google’s <b><i>URL Shortener</i></b>. There are also several services that allow you to create your own customizable shortened URLs which incorporate your branding.</p>

<h1>Twitter Marketing - Cards</h1>
<p>With <b><i>Twitter Cards</i></b>, you can attach rich photos, videos, and media experience to Tweets that drive traffic to your website. Simply add a few lines of HTML to your webpage, and users who Tweet links to your content will have a <b><i>Card</i></b> added to the Tweet that’s visible to all of their followers</p>
<img src="images/twitter_cards.jpg" alt="Twitter Cards" />
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Only one card per page is supported.</p>
<p>Each card has built-in content attribution, which surfaces appropriate Twitter accounts for the content as specified by you. Viewing users will be able to follow and view the profiles of attributed accounts directly from the card. You’ll have the option to choose between <b><i>Website Attribution and Creator Attribution</i></b>.</p>
<h2>Website Attribution</h2>
<p>Indicates the Twitter account for the website or platform on which the content was published. Note that a service may set separate Twitter accounts for different pages/sections of their website, and the most appropriate Twitter account should be used to provide the best context for the user.</p>
<h2>Creator Attribution</h2>
<p>Indicates the person that created the content within the card. The following Card types have a beautiful consumption experience built for Twitter’s web and mobile clients &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Summary Card</b> &minus; Title, description, thumbnail, and Twitter account attribution</p></li>
<li><p><b>Summary Card with Large Image</b> &minus; Similar to a Summary Card, but with a prominently featured image.</p></li>
<li><p><b>App Card</b> &minus; A Card to detail a mobile app with direct download.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Player Card</b> &minus; A Card to provide video/audio/media.</p></li>

<p>Ready to get started with Cards? In most cases, it takes less than 15 minutes to implement. Here is how to do it &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Choose a card type you want to implement.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the pertinent meta tags to your page.</p></li>
<li><p>Run your URL against the validator tool to test. If you are working with a Player Card, request approval for whitelisting. All other Cards do not need whitelisting.</p></li>
<li><p>After testing in the validator or approval of your Player Card, Tweet the URL and see the Card appear below your Tweet in the details view.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Twitter Card analytics to measure your results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the tags are live, you can test your Card using the <b><i>Twitter Card Validator</i></b>.</p>
<img src="images/card_validator.jpg" alt="Card Validator" />
<p>Keep in mind that most cards are unexpanded in the twitter feed, so you need to make the tweet compelling enough to have a viewer click to see more.</p>
<img src="images/viewer_click.jpg" alt="Viewer Click" />
<p>You need the reader to click on <b><i>View Summary</i></b> to see the full Tweet below.</p>
<img src="images/view_summary.jpg" alt="View Summary" />
<h2>Summary Cards</h2>
<p>The Summary Card can be used for many kinds of web content, from blog posts and news articles, to products and services. It is designed to give the reader a preview of the content before clicking through to your website. Example of a Tweet with a Summary Card &minus;</p>
<img src="images/summary_cards.jpg" alt="Summary Cards" />
<p>Adding a Summary Card to your Tweets is as simple as adding the following metatags to your site &minus;</p>
<img src="images/metatags.jpg" alt="Metatags" />
<p>Be sure to provide your own site attribution and content. Once the tags are live, you can test your Card using the <b><i>Twitter Card Validator</i></b>.</p>
<h2>Product Cards</h2>
<p>This Card was be DEPRECATED on July 3, 2015 and has been mapped to the Summary Card.</p>
<h2>Player Cards</h2>
<p>The Player Card supports streaming media experiences by putting a live video or audio player inside your Tweet. This is great for businesses that produce a lot of video or audio content, such as Vines or a podcast.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Description</b> &minus; 200 characters.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Image</b> &minus; It is displayed in place of the player on platforms that don’t support iframes or inline players. It has same dimensions as your player with size not more than 1MB.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Audio</b> &minus; AAC, Low Complexity Profile.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Card requires more than simply copying and pasting some meta tags.</p>
<ul class="list">

<li><p>Open the index.html file, and ensure the twitter:image, twitter:player, and twitter:player:stream values point to your server and file locations.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all paths are specified as secure (https://).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Test your URL. It’s important that you test the Player Card experience across all Twitter clients, including Twitter’s iPhone and Android apps as well as on twitter.com and mobile.twitter.com.</p>
<p>Cards that don’t work in all Twitter clients won’t be approved. To expedite the approval of your Card, read through the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player/approval">Player Card Approval Guide</a>.</p>

<h1>Twitter Marketing - Defining Strategy</h1>
<p>Every marketing activity you perform, from tweeting and texting to cold-calling, should be done for the sole purpose of accomplishing your brand’s end goals. You should have a regular rotation of content that will be discoverable and interesting to the people with related business interests and goals using the approaches above.</p>
<h2>What Should I Share on Twitter?</h2>
<p>Many of the questions you should be asking yourself when deciding what to share on Twitter that will resonate with your target audience are going to seem obvious &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>What industries am I targeting?</p></li>
<li><p>Who needs whatever value I am providing?</p></li>
<li><p>What are their demographics?</p></li>
<li><p>What key terms are they searching to solve their problems?</p></li>
<li><p>Are my customers/clients/community members restricted to a certain geolocation?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many marketers employ the 80/20 principle when engaging on twitter. 80% of your Tweets should focus on driving interactions with your followers, such as Retweets, replies, and likes. Once you build some rapport, you can mix in direct offers or promotions that get followers to take actions, such as clicking on a link or making a purchase from your website.</p>
<h2>Knowing Performance of Tweets</h2>
<p>Be aware of how your followers react to your content. Certain tools allow you to track who unfollows you on Twitter. With <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unfollowerstats.com/">unfollowstats.com</a> for example, you can opt to receive daily digests on how people are interacting with you on Twitter, including follows and unfollows. You may not know the exact reason someone unfollowed you, but you may be able to gain insight into the cause.</p>
<p>No matter what social-sharing platform you’re using, it should offer data on how your Tweets are performing. Both <b><i>Buffer</i></b> and <b><i>Hootsuite</i></b> provide ways to see a quick snapshot of how the Tweets are performing.</p>
<h2>Building the Brand on Twitter</h2>
<p>If you want real success on Twitter and you want to build your brand on Twitter, there are a few key pointers to employ &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Use your brand name as your Twitter name. It may seem obvious, but it needs to be reminded.</p></li>
<li><p>If branding a company is your topmost priority, use your logo as your Twitter portfolio photo.</p></li>
<li><p>You should Tweet 10 to 20 times a day to keep your brand name in the Twitter stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule the Tweets that have links to valuable content and complement that with 10 or so personalized Tweets where you are interacting with other Twitter users.</p></li>
<li><p>Reply to Everything! Really, everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to give. To build a strong brand on Twitter you will need to give back as much as you get. Share content from your tweeps, retweet, and favorite relevant content.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow at least two new people a day.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/followers.jpg" alt="Followers" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Follow back anyone who followed you. It’s the best way to keep the followers! Click on <b>Followers</b> and then follow anyone in your stream that you are not connected with.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Boosting Business Credibility on Twitter</h2>
<p>Your username affects perceptions of the credibility of your message. Research shows that messages coming from topical usernames (PsychologyForGrowth, AllScience) received a higher credibility rating than traditional names (Alex_Brown), and much higher than internet names (tenacious27, crazydog33).</p>
<p>Here are some tips on credibility boosting &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Whatever you write in the Bio section of your profile, should reflect your ideas and Tweets that you share. Remember that unfollowing someone takes a lot less decision than to follow someone.</p></li>
<li><p>Always use a headshot (unless you’re a branded business) of yourself, and try to smile as it helps to convey your personality more.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-standard grammar is the greatest hampering factor in credibility on Twitter. If you want to be seen as credible, avoid wrtng msgs with shrtr wrds or fewr letrs.</p></li>
<li><p>People hate being spammed or sold to. Provide real value to your followers by giving away great free content.</p></li>
<li><p>Answer questions. Write articles. Share videos. Retweet other people’s content that is relevant to your market place. Your followers will recognize your Tweets as valuable and useful to them, and will be much more likely to keep track of your Tweets in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the other authorities within your niche or related niches and become twitter friends with them. Then become real friends with them. Interacting with the other authorities means you can retweet their content, keep up-to-date with the current trends and paves the way for joint ventures etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Reputation Management</h1>
<p>Good reputation has far more value than money. A substantial reduction in negative word of mouth can boost sales. Managing your reputation on Twitter is crucial, if you are using Twitter to market your product, business, or brand.</p>
<h2>Using Google Alerts for Reputation Management</h2>
<p>Google Alerts is a great tool to ensure you don’t let an online mention of your brand go unnoticed. You need to follow these simple steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Go to the <b><i>Google Alerts</i></b> website.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter your company name, brand, or other industry keywords in the Search Terms text box.</p></li>
<li><p>Save it as an <b><i>Everything</i></b> alert type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can thus receive daily notifications of all news articles, websites, blogs, videos, and groups that mention your keywords.</p>
<h2>Using IFTTT for Reputation Management</h2>
<p>Another resource is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That</a> (IFTTT), which automates simple online tasks by using one of the most basic principles: If this happens, then do that.</p>
<p>IFTTT lets you set up rules (called recipes) for everything from getting the latest weather updates as a text message to automatically sending Instagram photos to Twitter (or any other platform). You can create a recipe by choosing a trigger channel (the “if this happens” part) and an action channel (the “then do that” part).</p>
<p>To monitor what people are saying about your company, set up a recipe that scans RSS feeds of important industry websites, then sends you a daily email alert with the results—IF [website] mentions your company, THEN receive an email alert.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://socialmention.com/">Social Mention</a> returns results based on the sentiment of social media buzz around your company. You can monitor multiple websites in one place and even find out which keywords people use when talking about your company.</p>
<p>To set up Social Mention monitoring, type your search term(s) in the text box and choose a channel such as blog, microblog, bookmark, image, video, or question. You can sort results by date, source, and time.</p>
<h2>Thumb Rules for Brand Discussion on Twitter</h2>
<p>When you brand is the topic of the town on a social platform like Twitter, here are some key points for reply &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Stich in Time</b> &minus; The social media works in real-time. If you find any problems, you can fix them instantly through a quick reply. You cannot wait for the problems or unhealthy debates about your brand and business to fade away on their own.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Be Gentle</b> &minus; Avoid losing temper or making threats while replying. By listening to others, you win respect and support from others thereby creating more business opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Be Proactive</b> &minus; When discussions related to your business industry open, get involved cordially and early with your perspective.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Be Polite</b> &minus; You need to use an appropriate tone e language while discussing a matter on social media. The issue gets resolved in some time but your impression as a business icon remains on minds for long time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Managing Conversions</h1>
<p>Conversion tracking is vital for Twitter marketing. When you run a campaign that connects Twitter users to your website, conversion tracking helps you understand what actions users take after coming to your website from your Tweets.</p>
<h2>Importance of Conversion Tracking</h2>
<p>By conversion tracking you can &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>See exactly how your spending contributes to specific goals, from making purchases to visiting specific product or landing pages of your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Know which ads are making the biggest impact exactly where it counts: when it’s time for users to make a purchase. You can optimize by creating similar ads in the future and allocate more of your budget to your highest-performing campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how customers interact with your ads across devices. If someone sees your Website Card on mobile and makes a purchase on your website from their desktop, you’ll be able to connect the two actions to one customer’s journey.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up Conversion Tracking</h2>
<p>Here is how you can set up tracking conversions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Log into Twitter Ads.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <b><i>Tools</i></b> drop down.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Conversion tracking</i></b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Create new website</i></b> tag.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a descriptive name for the website tag.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the conversion type you’re looking to track (site visit, purchase, download, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Check the <b><i>Create a tailored audience</i></b> box that records users who respond to your content as an “audience” along with other users who have a Twitter account and visit your page. That way, you can target them with future marketing campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <b><i>Show conversion</i></b> settings drop-down to alter the time frame a conversion can take place and be reflected in our data. The default is set to 30 days, which is recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <b><i>Save</i></b> tag and generate code snippet.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the website tag into the HTML code of a page you want to track. (If you are not confident, you can take the help of a web developer to do this). After someone has visited your tracked page for the first time, your tag will be verified on the Conversion tracking tab in Twitter Ads.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever somebody lands on your site from a Twitter campaign, the website tag will fire and record the conversion data. You can access this data on the <b><i>Campaigns page</i></b> of your <b><i>Twitter Ads dashboard</i></b> by clicking on <b><i>Conversions</i></b> button in the middle of the page.</p>

<h2>Conversion Tracking Best Practices</h2>
<p>Here are few best practices for tracking conversions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Tag every page where a conversion could take place (including your mobile pages) to grab the data from every path a customer could take.</p></li>
<li><p>As you place tags, think of the specific audiences you need to remarket to in the future. Set a different tag for each audience (promotional page visitors, people on mobile, etc.) so that you’ll have clean, useful audience lists to target.</p></li>
<li><p>Your analytics page groups tag types. Hence all the data from <b>Purchase</b> tags will be grouped together on the <b><i>Conversions</i></b> view.</p></li>
<li><p>You can see specific tags by clicking on each conversion.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - Automation</h1>
<p>While some automation tools do nothing but make your social media profile look like an announcement board, other tools can be used to synchronize right into your normal engagement to give it a helpful boost.</p>
<p>With express user consent, posting an automated Tweet after completing a particular action is permitted. For example, posting a Tweet after a user uploads a video to YouTube creates a new photo album, or beats a high score if permitted.</p>

<p>Leveraging the power of Twitter needs some third-party applications that cater to the features lacking in the main app directly. There are over a ton of Twitter third-party tools that are solely designed for a single purpose, here are some of the best &minus;</p>
<h3>Buffer</h3>
<p>It is simply one of the best Twitter tools out there for users who tend to Tweet in short bursts. Distributed Tweets throughout the day tend to convert better, and Buffer lets you schedule your Tweets to the best performing time of the day. A balanced tweeting schedule is the sign of an organized individual and should gain you more attention.</p>

<h1>Twitter Marketing - Native Analytics</h1>
<p>As a business or marketing person, you are aware that analytics provides insight to the customers and market. You can check Twitter analytics on your mobile phone and can receive monthly reports on your campaigns. Analytics tells you which mention drove your campaign engagements most and who are your top followers.</p>
<p>You can access analytics on Twitter if you become an advertiser. Let us know about Twitter Analytics more.</p>
<h2>Accessing Twitter Analytics</h2>
<p>You don’t need to create Twitter ad campaigns to access the data in Twitter’s native analytics tool. If you don’t already have an advertiser account, you can request advertiser status by visiting <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://analytics.twitter.com</a>. You’ll have to submit some information about your company including the payment information.</p>
<h3>Twitter Dashboard</h3>
<p>When your account is changed to advertiser status, log in to see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://analytics.twitter.com/">Twitter Analytics dashboard</a>. The dashboard is very well segmented into sections. You have access to three distinct sections &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Tweeter Activities</li>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>Twitter Cards</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tweets dashboard is the best place to find detailed information about how your outgoing messages are performing. At a glance you can see the month’s interaction and the best Tweets you sent out.</p>
<img src="images/tweet_activity.jpg" alt="Tweet Activity" />
<p>Under the graph is a section that highlights all of your recent Tweets and details the impressions, engagements, and engagement rate associated with each Tweet.</p>
<img src="images/engagements.jpg" alt="Engagements" />
<p>In the right sidebar you can see engagement over the last month. You can use this data to figure out which days showed the best performance and replicate the tactics used on those days.</p>
<p>If you want to compare this month’s data to past data, you can download a Click Export Data (CSV) file with details on Tweets for the past several months.</p>
<p>You can then use that data to determine whether interaction has changed, what content your leads interacted with most, and when they interacted with it.</p>
<img src="images/audience_dashboard.jpg" alt="Audience Dashboard" />
<p>The Audience dashboard shows you the demographic breakdown of your audience, the topics of interest, and more. Use this information to fine tune your content on Twitter.</p>
<h1>Twitter Marketing - HootSuite</h1>
<p>Juggling multiple social media accounts across several networks can get hectic, especially with multiple browser tabs for each account.</p>
