<h1>SAP PM - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP Plant Maintenance (SAP PM) application component provides an organization with a tool for all maintenance activities to be performed. All the activities that are performed under maintenance are interconnected and hence this module is closely integrated with other modules - Production Planning, Material Management, and Sales and Distribution.</p>
<p>Using SAP PM, you can perform automatic repairs and facilitate maintenance requests in an organization. It allows you to record problems in SAP system, plan labor and material activities, and to record and settle the cost.</p>
<p>In an organization, you can identify, document, manage problems and perform enterprise asset management for any required assets.</p>
<p>To perform these activities, Plant Maintenance contains the following submodules &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Management of technical objects and equipment master record.</li>
<li>Planning of maintenance task.</li>
<li>Manage workflow notifications and work orders under maintenance order management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Functions of Plant Maintenance</h2>
<p>Following activities are performed under Plant Maintenance &minus;</p>
<h3>Inspection</h3>
<p>Inspection is done to check the actual condition of a technical system.</p>
<h3>Preventive Maintenance</h3>
<p>Preventive maintenance is used to maintain high availability of the technical system. It includes maintenance planning and work scheduling activities for technical objects.</p>
<h3>Repair</h3>
<p>Repair involves all measures that can be performed to restore the ideal condition. Repair process can be performed at many planning stages - like work scheduling, resource planning and initial costing, etc. You can respond immediately w.r.t to a damage events causing production shutdown. You can create required purchase requisition and processed work orders to reduce the downtime.</p>
<h2>Integration with Other Modules</h2>
<p>In SAP PM, you can integrate with other modules such as Material Management, Production Planning, Personnel Management, and Sales and Distribution. These modules are used to keep the current data as per the requirement in Plant Maintenance and are initiated automatically to maintain the current data in the system.</p>
<p>Following are the key modules in which integration is performed with Plant Maintenance &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Material Management</li>
<li>Sales and Distribution</li>
<li>Personnel Management</li>
<li>Controlling</li>
<li>Production Planning</li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure depicts a work order notification process and shows how it is executed under Plant Maintenance.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pm/images/work_order_process.jpg" alt="Work Order Process" />
<p>The key steps involved are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Notification</li>
<li>Newly Created Work Order</li>
<li>Creation of Purchase request for work orders</li>
<li>Purchase Order created and parts Received</li>
<li>Parts issues to Work Order</li>
<li>Approval and Planning of Work Order</li>
<li>Scheduling and Releasing Work Order</li>
<li>Work Order Execution</li>
<li>Closing a Work Order</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP PM - Technical Objects</h1>
<p>To effectively manage SAP Maintenance activities in an organization, you need to divide the existing maintenance structure into technical objects. Technical objects are used to define the machine types that exists in an organization and using the object characteristics, you can further define other technical objects</p>
<p>To show technical objects in the system, you should know about maintenance planning and structure in the organization. This involves the task of defining the maintenance plant and maintenance of the planning activities in the system.</p>
<h2>Maintenance Plant</h2>
<p>Maintenance plant for a technical object is known as a plant in which you perform the maintenance tasks for the objects and planning is done. You can perform the following activities in Maintenance Planning Plant &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Define the task list as per the maintenance plan</li>
<li>As per BOM in the task list, perform material planning</li>
<li>Manage and schedule maintenance plans</li>
<li>Create and execute maintenance orders</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us say the maintenance plant for a modelling plant P1 is 001 and maintenance planning tasks for this plant is assigned to plant 002. In plant 002, you have maintenance planner group works and in SAP system it is shown as maintenance planning plant. So maintenance planning plant for Plant P1 is 002 and maintenance planner group works for plant 001 and 002.</p>
<h2>Maintenance Planning</h2>
<p>As per the structure of the organization, maintenance planning can be performed. You define the tasks under maintenance planning as per the structure and defined technical objects. Following types of maintenance planning is possible &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Centralized Maintenance Planning</li>
<li>Decentralized Maintenance Planning</li>
<li>Partially Centralized Maintenance Planning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Centralized Maintenance Planning</h3>
<p>Within an organization, centralized planning supports the following structures &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>There is only one plant for all the technical objects which is the <b>maintenance planning plant</b> and maintenance plant.</p></li>
<li><p>In other scenarios, it is possible that an organization has multiple maintenance plants, but there is one plant where maintenance planning is performed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to the above example &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Plants &minus; 001, 002</li>
<li>Maintenance Plants &minus; 001, 002</li>
<li>Maintenance Planning Plant &minus; 002</li>
<li>Plants assigned to maintenance planning plant &minus; 001</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decentralized Maintenance Planning</h3>
<p>In this scenario, the organization consists of multiple plants and each plant acts as its own maintenance planning plant. In SAP system, all plants are mentioned as maintenance planning plant.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Plants &minus; 001, 002</li>
<li>Maintenance Plants &minus; 001,002</li>
<li>Maintenance planning plants &minus; 001, 002</li>
</ul>
<h3>Partially Centralized Maintenance Planning</h3>
<p>In partially centralized maintenance planning, an organization consists of multiple plants and some of the plants act as maintenance plants and maintenance planning plants, while the other plants can act as maintenance planning plants. The plants which are not responsible for maintenance planning, they are assigned to other maintenance planning plants.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Plants &minus; 001, 002, 003,004</li>
<li>Maintenance Plants &minus; 001, 002, 003, 004</li>
<li>Maintenance Planning Plant &minus; 001, 004</li>
<li>Plants assigned to maintenance planning plant 001 &minus; 001, 002</li>
<li>Plants assigned to maintenance planning plant 004 &minus; 003, 004</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structure of Technical Objects</h2>
<p>Different types of structures can be used for technical object as per the structure of the organization. Following are the options &minus;</p>
<h3>Functional Structuring</h3>
<p>In this type of structure, you divide your technical system as per functional locations. With the division of the product line into functional locations, an individual unit can act as functional locations in the system.</p>
<h3>Object Related Structuring</h3>
<p>In this structuring, you divide your technical system into pieces known as equipment. An equipment is an individual object, which can be placed in a technical system or a part of the technical system.</p>
<h3>Functional and Object-based Structuring</h3>
<p>It is a combination of both the functional and object-related structuring using equipment and they are divided as per functional location.</p>
<p>In this structuring, your functional location tells where the technical tasks are performed and equipment represents the object with which tasks have to be performed.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In short, it can be said that a functional location is an organizational unit that is used to maintain the objects of a company as per the functional area, process-related or spatial criteria. A functional location represents the place at which a maintenance task is to be performed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Example of functional area &minus; Pumping station</li>
<li>Example of process related criteria &minus; Modeling</li>
<li>Example of spatial criteria &minus; Store room</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a Functional Location</h2>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To create a functional location, navigate to Logistics &rarr; Plant Maintenance &rarr; Management of Technical Objects &rarr; Functional Location &rarr; Create</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pm/images/functional_location.jpg" alt="Functional Location" />

<p>In the next window, you can see the screen Create Functional Location &minus; Master data.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Enter all the details in the master data to create the functional location. If you want to classify the functional location, click the Classification option.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pm/images/master_data.jpg" alt="Master Data" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Once you click Classification, it will open Create Functional Location &minus; Classification window.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pm/images/classification_window.jpg" alt="Classification Window" />
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Enter the classes to which you want to assign the functional location in the column Class.</p>
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Select the class that is to be the standard class for the functional location in the field StdClass.</p>
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; To specify value entries for the class, position your cursor on the class you require and choose Edit Values.</p>
<p><b>Step 9</b> &minus;  Select the status as shown in the following screenshot &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pm/images/status.jpg" alt="Status" />
<p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; Once you define all the fields for the master record, go to the main screen using the arrow buttons. Click the Save button at the top to save the Functional location.</p>

<h1>SAP PM - Equipment Master Record</h1>
<p>An equipment is known as an individual object in the system that is maintained independently. Equipment can be installed at different functional locations. You can create an individual equipment in an organization based on the object-based structure of a technical system.</p>
<p>The use of an equipment at a functional location are documented over the course of time. You always define Equipment master record for each technical object in the system.</p>
<p>Using an equipment, you can perform the following functions in the system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>You can manage an individual data from a maintenance perspective in the SAP system.</li>
<li>You can perform an individual maintenance task for each technical object in the system.</li>
<li>You can use this to maintain a record of all the maintenance tasks performed for a technical object.</li>
<li>In case you want to see data for an object for a longer time, you can use an equipment master record for the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Equipment master record should be created in the following scenarios &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>When you manage individual data for the technical object.</li>
<li>When you perform the maintenance tasks for technical objects.</li>
<li>When you collect and record technical data for the objects for long time periods.</li>
<li>When you monitor the cost of maintenance tasks.</li>
<li>When you want to record the technical objects at functional locations.</li>

<h3>Representing an Object as an Equipment or as a Functional Location</h3>
<p>In case of breakdown, you should represent an object as a Technical Object if it is repaired. When you define an object as a Technical object, you can maintain the service history of the object in the system. <b>Note</b> that you can’t change the equipment number once it is created in the system. If you have entered an incorrect number mistakenly you need to achieve this to change it.</p>
<p>When you are using a multiple piece of equipment you need to classify the equipment to perform a quick search.</p>
<p>When you exchange an object in case of a breakdown due to its low value, in this case you don’t need to maintain a service history. For each functional location, you have to define a structure indicator as mentioned earlier. When you maintain a functional location in another functional location, you can’t store the installation location history.</p>

<h1>SAP PM - Maintenance Planning</h1>
<p>Maintenance planning in SAP PM is used to avoid any equipment breakdown or production breakdown. It is used to represent inspection, preventive maintenance and repairs for which you plan time and scope of work in advance. By performing effective maintenance planning, you can remove the breakdowns, which can result in environmental hazards.</p>
<p>Maintenance planning component is integrated with different components of other modules and subcomponents in Plant Maintenance &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Maintenance task lists</li>
<li>Maintenance orders</li>
<li>Maintenance notifications</li>
<li>Work clearance management</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various components of Maintenance Planning that integrates with other modules such as Quality Planning and Material Management.</p>
<p>Maintenance planning is used describe date and inspection activities to be performed for technical objects. It ensures that technical objects work with breakdown and hence improve the optimization of all the objects.</p>
<h2>Maintenance Plans</h2>
<p>Maintenance plan defines the schedule and list of tasks to be performed under Maintenance Planning. A maintenance plan can be created as per organization’s work such as different objects can be maintained on different dates and the scope can be different as per the object type.</p>
<p>Following procedures can be used to create Preventive Maintenance Plan &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Single Cycle Plan</li>
<li>Strategy Plan</li>
<li>Multiple Counter plan</li>
<li>Maintenance plan for service procurement</li>
<li>Maintenance plan for an outline agreement</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pm/images/maintenance_plans.jpg" alt="Maintenance Plans" />
<h3>Single Cycle Plan</h3>
<p>Single cycle maintenance plan is used to define exactly one time-based or performancebased maintenance cycle, in which you specify the interval at which the maintenance plan should be executed. It is one of the simplest maintenance plan used for Maintenance planning.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Annual maintenance of a car or service of a Printer after 1 million copies.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus;  To create a single cycle plan, navigate to Logistics &rarr; Plant Maintenance &rarr; Preventive Maintenance &rarr; Maintenance Planning &rarr; Maintenance Plans &rarr; Create &rarr; Single Cycle Plan or <b>T-Code &minus; IP41</b></p>
