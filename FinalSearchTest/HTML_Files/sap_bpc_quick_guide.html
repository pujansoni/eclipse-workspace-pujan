</table>
<p>SAP BPC for NetWeaver provides various advantages since it is integrated with BW system and allows you to store data in InfoCubes.</p>
<p>Some key advantages of using SAP BPC with NW system are &minus;</p>
<p><b>Star Schema for Exceptional Reporting</b> &minus; SAP BPC uses NW InfoCubes to store the data. The dimension model used is extended star schema so it makes BPC with NW system and exceptional system for reporting.</p>
<p><b>No Database Dependence Version</b> &minus; BPC NW version is not dependent on database version and can run common databases like DB2, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.</p>
<p><b>BW Accelerator Support</b> &minus; SAP NetWeaver BW accelerator tool is an additional feature that can be used to enhance the performance of reporting in the system, even if you are using large datasets. It indirectly helps in saving the cost for a company as less number of performance issues are reported.</p>
<p><b>BAdI Development and ABAP Support</b> &minus; SAP BPC with NetWeaver allows you to use ABAP programming to develop K2 script logic. It enables to create business add-in BAdi interface in the back-end system, which can be called later from script logic developed in BPC system.</p>
<p>It helps in solving the complex business requirements and to reduce the development time for an organization.</p>
<p>Some <b>key advantages</b> of using <b>SAP BPC</b> MS are &minus;</p>
<p>Apart from common features provided in BPC like currency translation, allocations, validation and account transformations, automatic adjustments and carry forward of opening balance, the following features can be achieved in BPC MS version &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Dimension Logic</b> &minus; This can be configured in BPC system using simple mathematical formulas.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Business Rules</b> &minus; This allows you to create rules in BPC system to perform specific functions.</p></li>
<li><p><b>K2 Script Logic</b> &minus; This is used to perform some specific functions which can’t be achieved using out-of-box functionality to meet business requirements. You can create K2 script logics to perform certain functions, which can be performed in a standard system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many organizations use MS Excel to manage business planning and consolidation but it has some disadvantages. Following are the <b>disadvantages</b> of using <b>BPC MS</b> over <b>NetWeaver</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Tough to Manage Excel Spreadsheets</b> &minus; As business planning and consolidation data is stored in the form of spreadsheets, it creates a security issue and an option to control access is by keeping the files on the shared network drive. In SAP BPC, you can save the data in database and this provides security of data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Version Control</b> &minus; To create a new version of data, SAP BPC with NW allows you to maintain the version of data in the system and you can maintain the current data too. While using Excel spreadsheets for data store, you need to name the file with new name every time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integrity of Spreadsheets</b> &minus; Using spreadsheets make it tough to manage the integrity of the sheets as the same file is accessed by multiple users and it’s tough to find out the latest version of spreadsheet. However, SAP system has a central repository to maintain financial and business planning data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Collaboration</b> &minus; SAP BPC allows you to collaborate data from different users and you can put comments on critical information and Excel doesn’t support collaboration feature.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP BPC with NetWeaver Architecture</h2>
<p><b>Requirement</b> &minus; SAP NetWeaver ABAP 7.3 or 7.31</p>
<p><b>Database</b> &minus; Any of the above version of SAP NetWeaver support.</p>
<p><b>Operating System</b> &minus; Any supported version of SAP NetWeaver system and database engine.</p>
<p>The following figure shows SAP BPC 10.0 architecture.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/sap_bpc_architecture.jpg" alt="SAP BPC Architecture" />
<h2>SAP NetWeaver BW Objects</h2>
<p>Difference between SAP BPC v7.5 and v10 is Web Server component. SAP BPC 7.5 NetWeaver uses Microsoft ISS, while BPC 10.0 NW and BPC 10 on HANA use the web server that is part of SAP NetWeaver.</p>
<p>SAP NW 10 is more scalable than SAP NW 7.5 (IIS in 32bit mode) and it simplifies the system topology as no separate Web Server and Network Load Balancing components are required as these were part of BPC 7.5 implementations.</p>
<p>Another difference between the two is version of SAP NetWeaver. SAP BPC 7.5 NW supports SAP NetWeaver 7.01 and 7.02. However, SAP BPC 10 NetWeaver and BPC 10 HANA doesn’t support NW 7.01, 7.02 versions. Also note that NW 7.01 and 7.02 requirements are quite different from SAP NetWeaver 7.3.</p>
<p>It means SAP BPC 7.5 NW systems in many organizations are running on older versions of Operating Systems and RDBMS is not supported by SAP NetWeaver 7.3.</p>
<p>Following are the key NetWeaver BW Objects &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>InfoObject</li>
<li>InfoProvider</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP BPC Objects</h2>
<p>As per the above architecture, following are the key objects in BPC 10.0 &minus;</p>
<p><b>Client Interface</b> &minus; At the top, you have client interface which is a web-based tool used for configuration and reporting for business planning. It consists of MS Office client, Excel based admin clients, and web-based tool for reporting.</p>
<p>Microsoft-based admin tool is used for configuration of application and Microsoft Office tools such as Word and PowerPoint are used for reporting data.</p>
<p><b>Web Server and .NET Application Server</b> &minus; This tool uses web services to connect to .NET Application Server. It receives the request from client interface and directs all the requests to ABAP server, which is a part of SAP NetWeaver BW system.</p>
<p>This server is used for data conversion between client tools and SAP NetWeaver BW system.</p>
<p><b>SAP NetWeaver Application Server</b> &minus; This server is used to process all the requests from client tool. The request from .NET Application server is processed in this server as Remote Function Call RFC. This is used to process requests to create reports or to update the database.</p>
<p>When a request is processed by the Application Server, it gets the data and passes to .NET Application Server, and then sends it back to client interface.</p>
<p><b>Database Server</b> &minus; This layer is responsible to store all the data in the database. SAP NW back-end system is responsible to create objects and data is stored for BPC system. The NetWeaver supports most of the databases like SQL Server, DB2, Oracle and many more.</p>
<h3>Release Strategy</h3>
<p>Following are the release notes from SAP for SAP BPC 10.0 &minus;</p>

<p><b>Environment</b> &minus; It is defined as the starting point for creating any application or model. It was called Application sets or AppSet in older versions of BPC.</p>
<p><b>Dimensions</b> &minus; You can mark a dimension as secure. You need to grant read and write access to the users who use the model so they can access data.</p>
<p><b>Properties</b> &minus; This is used to provide additional information to the dimension.</p>
<p><b>Dimension Members</b> &minus; Each dimension member record shows master, text and hierarchy data associated with the keys of dimension.</p>
<p><b>Model</b> &minus; To meet the Business Planning and Consolidation requirement of an organization, you need to build a model in an environment which is defined as collection of several dimensions.</p>
<p><b>Data Manager Package</b> &minus; To execute common tasks in BPC, you need data manager package.</p>
<p><b>Business Rules</b> &minus; To manage operations in different countries, different set of business rules are required. BPC includes rule-based table to meet some requirements for business planning and consolidation. Various rules can be set related to business planning and consolidation like - currency translation, balance carry forward, intercompany elimination, and data validation, etc.</p>
<p><b>Logic Scripts</b> &minus; This is defined as a set of SQL or MDX programming structure to perform some customize functions for flexibility and manage data models. When some specific requirements are not achieved using business rules that can be met by the use of Logic Scripts.</p>
<p><b>User</b> &minus; A user is defined as an individual who uses the application in Appset.</p>
<p><b>Team</b> &minus; A team is defined as a group of users based on user roles.</p>
<p><b>Task</b> &minus; All the activities that are performed in SAP BPC system are called tasks.</p>
<h1>SAP BPC - Applications</h1>
<p>An <b>Application</b> in BPC system is defined as multidimensional data model used in EPM. Few examples of Applications are - Operation, Legal or Finance team.</p>
<p>There are two types of applications in BPC system - Reporting and Non-Reporting. <b>Reporting applications</b> are used for analysis purpose and you can pass inputs from the users. <b>Non-Reporting applications</b> are used to contain reference data like currency rates, carry forward balances, etc.</p>
<p>An <b>Appset</b> consists of one or multiple applications in system. Each application consists of the master data for an application, which is used to control data in the application set. An application can also share one or multiple dimensions with other applications.</p>
<h2>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>Each Reporting application consists of a dimension, properties to hold the additional information, and dimension members.</p>
<p>Consider a Consolidation Rate application, which consists of Rate app to store currency exchange rates and an Owner application, which stores the relationship between Owner company and its subsidiary companies.</p>

<h2>Creating Applications and Applying Dimensions</h2>
<p>To add an application to the Application set, you can use an existing application by selecting reference applications and any set of business rules. You can also add dimensions in new application and these can be defined as secure or non-secure. When you define dimensions as secure it ensures the read and write access is controlled through user profiles.</p>
<p>You can add an application through an admin console &minus; Application &rarr; Add a New Application</p>
<p>To copy an application &minus; Application &rarr; Copy an Application</p>
<p>To create a Consolidation application, you need to define AppSet for consolidation and dimension set for consolidation.</p>
<p>You should set the following parameters after creating the application set.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>ALLOW_FILE_SIZE</li>
<li>UPLOADTEMP</li>
<li>TEMPLATEVERSION</li>
<li>JREPORTZOOM</li>
<li>LOGLEVEL</li>
<li>SYSTEM</li>
<li>MESSAGE</li>
<li>STATUS</li>
</ul>
<p>In SAP BPC NetWeaver version, all these parameters are maintained in ABAP DDIC table.</p>
<p>Once the application set is created, the next step is to set up the parameters for Dimension set.</p>
<p>You can add a new dimension or copy an existing dimension. In the Administration Console, go to Dimension and Model.</p>

<h1>SAP BPC - Model Design</h1>
<p>With the release of BPC 10.1 with NetWeaver, there are two models that can be used to fulfill the business requirements. BPC models are often referred to as BPC applications and BPC environment is normally called Application.</p>
<h2>Building Models in BPC</h2>
<p>The following types of model can be built in BPC &minus;</p>
<h3>Standard Model</h3>
<p>This model provides an option within host BW’s protected namespace “/CPMB/”. When you separate the BPC transaction data and master data inside the namespace (“/CPMB/”), all the sub-processes that are associated with standard model are closely secured, and only closely managed by the department running the app.</p>
<p>This model is designed by SAP to provide a protected area for customers who to plan and consolidate in their own department without wanting to share or coordinate the resources with other Business Warehouse community users.</p>
<p>As the code set of Standard model has been coordinated with version BPC 10.0 so all the changes to BPC 10.0 are shown in BPC 10.1 Standard model and changes to the version BPC 10.1 Standard model are shown in version BPC 10.0.</p>
<p>This allows a code compatibility between BPC 10.0 and BPC 10.1, and clients can easily perform migrations while upgrading BPC version from 10.0 to 10.1 Standard Model.</p>
<p>In short, you can say in Standard model, BPC environment contains the BPC applications or models and each model generates a BW InfoCube which is hidden.</p>
<h3>Embedded Model</h3>
<p>This model is different from Standard model and includes data access to all community users. For Embedded design model, initial versions used were SAP BW Integrated Planning and Planning Application Kit i.e. BW-IP and PAK.</p>
<p>This model provides a different level of data access where master and transactional data from host EDW environment is accessible by the application. In Embedded model, it allows easy access to transactional and master data within the host BW, and this data is shared with many other users and controlled by the administrator group.</p>
<p>In Embedded model, migration from older versions of Business Warehouse IP, BW-IP to this data model is relatively easy and migration from earlier versions like (BPC 10.0 and earlier) is considered as a new implementation.</p>
<p>In short, you can say that in embedded model, any number of InfoProviders can be assigned to a single BPC model/application.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/embedded_model.jpg" alt="Embedded Model" />
<h2>Environment Management</h2>
<p>An application in BPC is also known as a model, like an environment is called an AppSet. You can create an application by going to Admin console in Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) System. BPC environment or AppSet has the group of applications or models. All these applications share the planning dimensions and are linked with each other.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, applications are called multidimensional data models in EPM. You can add a new application or also copy an existing application.</p>
<p>Environment management includes setting up work status for applications and adding the business rules to the applications.</p>
<h3>Work Status Determination in Environment</h3>
<p>Work status determines who can make changes to data or who can change the work state on the data set.</p>
<p>In Environment management, you can also carry out applications optimization. When a new application is created, it contains only a small amount of data. As time passes, data in application increases and it is always recommended to perform application performance optimization in BPC environment.</p>
<h3>Deleting an Application in Environment Management</h3>
<p>It is also possible to delete any application in BPC environment when required by going to admin console. You need to be an administrator to perform this function.</p>
<h2>Dimension Management</h2>
<p>Dimension management in BPC includes creating new dimensions, defining members in dimensions, and assigning properties. Dimension contains member and there is a hierarchy between members that is defined like parent, child and sibling.</p>
<p>You can create a new dimension by going to Admin Console &rarr; Dimension &rarr; New Dimension.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/dimension_management.jpg" alt="Dimension Management" />
<p>Dimension name is not case sensitive and it should be unique.</p>
<p>When adding a new dimension, you have to enter reference type. Planning and Consolidation checks the value of reference type while processing the dimension.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/new_dimension.jpg" alt="New Dimension" />
<p>Click Create button in the above window. You have to enter referential integrity for Rate type in the new window. Click ‘Save’ icon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/structure_dimension.jpg" alt="Structure Dimension" />
<p>You can also edit structure, edit members, delete or copy an existing dimension. To copy a dimension, select an existing dimension and go to Copy.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/edit_dimension.jpg" alt="Edit Dimension" />
<p>Enter the name of dimension and description. Click ‘Copy’ button.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/copy_dimension.jpg" alt="Copy Dimension" />
<p><b>Naming Conventions in Dimensions</b> &minus; You shouldn’t use special characters while naming a dimension, member, and application in BW table.</p>
<p>You can create dimension name up to 16 characters and it shouldn’t contain comma, double comma, back slashes, ampersands. However, you can use underscore.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t use the following names - App, AppAccess, AvlObject, CategoryAccess, CollabDoc, CollabIcons, CollabRecipient, CollabSupport, CollabType, DBVERSION, Defaults, DesktopStyleDef, Dimension, DrillDef, DTIParam, Function, Formula, Group, InvestParam, MemberAccess, MessageLog, Packages, PageDef, Permission, PublishedBooks, Rate, ReportParam, SectionDef, Status, StatusCode, TaskAccess, User, UserGroup, UserPackages, UserPovDef, WebContents, SOURCE, SIGNEDDATA.</p>
<p>Description of dimension shouldn’t be more than 50 characters.</p>
<p>You can delete a dimension by selecting it and clicking the ‘Delete’ button.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/delete_dimension.jpg" alt="Delete Dimension"/>
<h2>Designing Security Model</h2>
<p>BPC security is managed in Administration console. You have to login to BPC portal and go to Planning and Consolidation Administration.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/designing_security_model.jpg" alt="Designing Security Model" />
<p>There are four key components in BPC security &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<li>Teams</li>
<li>Task Profiles</li>
<li>Data Access Profiles</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/bpc_security.jpg" alt="BPC Security" />
<p><b>Users</b> &minus; This is used to add users to environment and manage their access rights.</p>
<p><b>Teams</b> &minus; This is not so important and you can define a team of users with the same access rights.</p>
<p><b>Task Profiles</b> &minus; This allows setting up profiles for tasks to be performed and assign them to users and teams.</p>
<p><b>Data Access Profiles</b> &minus; This is used to set up profiles that allow access to data in models and assign them to users and teams.</p>
<p>Click ‘Team’ tab under Security, select Admin team and double-click.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/team_tab.jpg" alt="Team Tab"/>
<p>You will see the details of Team name – ADMIN, which users are part of this team, task profiles, and data access profiles.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/details_team_tab.jpg" alt="Details of Team Tab"/>
<p>You can edit the team details and click ‘Save’ icon to apply changes.</p>
<p>Going to the user tab, you can add new users, edit existing users, and delete any user.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/user_tab.jpg" alt="User Tab"/>
<h1>SAP BPC - Data Loading</h1>
<p>Data loading in BPC is done with the help of Data Manager that allows you to move data in Planning and Consolidation system, copy and move data and export data from an application. Data Manager moves the data in form of packages, which allows scheduled sequences to run in the background and some can initiate other processes.</p>
<h2>Loading Data from Source System to Cube in SAP NetWeaver BW</h2>
<p>We can pull the data from different source system like SAP ECC system, SAP CRM, SRM using extractors. You can also load data from non-SAP sources to InfoCube in SAP BW system.</p>
<p>To load the data into InfoCube, go to workbench in BW system.</p>

<h1>SAP BPC - Planning</h1>
<p>SAP BPC provides you with an end-to-end planning process and perform activities like planning, forecasting, budgeting, reporting, etc. It allows you to follow top-down or bottom-up planning with an application and user interface.</p>
<h2>Planning Process</h2>
<p>In Business Planning and Consolidation, the planning process is supported by automation and workflows. It allows you to create reports and input forms that can write to database.</p>
<p>With reporting interface, you can get data from database to excel spreadsheets and input forms allow you to send data directly to the database.</p>
<p>Input forms contain the same functionality and formatting as reports, only difference is that reports are used for analysis and input forms are used for sending data to database.</p>
<h2>Planning Models</h2>
<p>Different modeling options are possible with input forms to meet the planning needs while sending data to database.</p>
<p><b>Spread</b> &minus; Spread modeling option allows you to send a value to specific destination cells. This value can be spread equally or weighted by the range of values.</p>
<p><b>Trend</b> &minus; Trend modeling method allows you to spread a value or a percentage and spread it by a growing factor in destination cells. You place the source value in first destination cell and rest of the cells are field with increased value by some amount or percentage.</p>
<p><b>Weighted</b> &minus; It allows you to allocate a set of values by weighted factor in the excel sheets. In this you select some values, grow them and then allocate the new amount based on weights of selected cells.</p>
<p>So input forms provide you with special modeling feature to assist you in your planning needs.</p>
<h2>Input Forms/ Input Schedules</h2>
<p>Note that input forms is the terminology used in BPC 10 whereas input schedules were used in BPC 7.x. However, eventually they both represent the same thing.</p>
<p>Input forms allow you to spread data from excel sheets directly to database and contains all the functions that are present with reports in BPC. The difference is that input forms write data to database and reports are used for analysis purpose.</p>
<p>Input forms support the following features &minus;</p>
<p><b>Data Submission</b> &minus; If you have enough authorize access, using input forms you can send data to database. If data validation is allowed by the system administrator, you can also validate the data and ensure that there is no work lock and validity issues on members.</p>
<p><b>Modelling Options</b> &minus; Various modeling options can be used with input forms &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Spread</li>
<li>Trend</li>
<li>Weighted</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Work Status</b> &minus; After sending the data to database, you can change the work status locks to apply data locks.</p>
<p><b>Distribution and Collection Option</b> &minus; You can send the input schedules to different members using distribution option and then get back the input schedules using collection option.</p>
<p><b>Using Special formalities</b> &minus; You can also apply special formatting to read-only cells.</p>
<h2>Input Schedule Templates</h2>
<p>There are various templates provided in the system that you can use and apply the customizations as per your needs.</p>
<p>Following is the list of dynamic schedule templates that are available in the system.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle; width:37%">Account Trend or Entity Trend</td>
<td>This schedule contains Account type members in rows and time periods in columns, using EvDRE functions.</td>

<h1>SAP BPC - Business Logic</h1>
<p>You can perform business logic and script logic on the data in BPC. There are various calculations that can be performed.</p>
<p><b>Business Rules</b> &minus; These are monetary functions which are used to post common accounting tasks in Business Planning and Consolidation model.</p>
<p><b>Script Logic</b> &minus; This includes the formulas which are used to perform different calculations on the members, dimensions, and data in BPC system.</p>
<h2>Dimension Logic</h2>
<p>Dimension logic is used to apply calculations and formulas on the dimensions. Calculations are performed as per the dimension formula at retrieval time. It is important to use the dimension formulas correctly as they can affect the system performance if used incorrectly.</p>
<p><b>Key points to remember while applying Dimension logic</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Dimension formula affects the system performance so they should be applied correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension formulas should be applied only on the members for which calculations are required after the aggregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Dimension formulas should be used only for those ratios which has to be calculated at both the levels - Base and Parent Level.</p></li>
<li><p>Common Dimension member formulas are used to perform calculations - costs per unit, growth rates, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Define Dimension Logic?</h2>
<p>You should be familiar with Multi Dimension Expression language to create complex Dimension formulas. The list of supported MDX functions is available from functional module BAPI_MDPROVIDER_GET_FUNCTIONS.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites</b> &minus; To use a formula in dimension, you should add a property called Formula to member sheets using manage dimension task option.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/define_dimension_logic1.jpg" alt="Define Dimension Logic" />
<p>You should also define the length of field and it should be more than 60 characters. Higher field lengths are preferred as any length greater than 60 is stored as string in SAP NetWeaver.</p>
<p>If you want to use Dimension formula in AppSet then you should maintain a special dimension member of type R. This member is called as Local Currency (LC).</p>
<p>App set &rarr; Select Maintain Dimension Members.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/define_dimension_logic2.jpg" alt="Define Dimension Logic" />
<p>The formula can be manually created or taken from a library dimension formula. To define member dimension formula, you have to put a Square bracket around the dimension and there is a dot between the two.</p>
<p>[PRODUCT].[PRODUCT1] – [PRODUCT].[PRODUCT2]</p>
<p>[SALES].[SALES1] / [SALES].[SALES2]</p>
<p>Standard Arithmetic functions has to be used in dimension formula - addition (&plus;), subtraction (&minus;), multiplication (*), Division (/) - these are used in SAP NetWeaver.</p>
<p>Once you save the dimension formulas, next is to validate the syntax.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/define_dimension_logic3.jpg" alt="Define Dimension Logic" />
<h2>Logic Scripts</h2>
<p>Logic scripts allow you to automate the calculations in BPC for the financial statements.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/logic_scripts.jpg" alt="Logic Scripts" />
<h2>Business Rules</h2>
<p>Business rules are used to customize the data manipulation task like bulk data imports with currency translations, input data to database, etc. Business rules can be modified using table-based logic or scripts-based filters. Table-based logic provides the features available in UCON accelerator and Script-based files can be customized using MDX or SQL syntax.</p>
<p>You can define business rules for the following activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Carry forward rules</b> &minus; Includes initializing balances when a new fiscal year starts.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Validation rules</b> &minus; Validates the input data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Currency conversion rules</b> &minus; Converts the local currencies into the currency used in BPC reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Intercompany booking rules</b> &minus; Matches intercompany transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic Adjustments and Other Calculations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To manage business rules in BPC system &minus; Go to Administration as shown in the following screenshot. Go to Rules &rarr; Expand &rarr; Business Rules.</p>

<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/business_rule3.jpg" alt="Business Rule" />
<h2>Script Logic</h2>
<p>With help of script logic, you can write your own logic in SQL or MDX language. There are various MDX functions that can be used in dimension formulas. Some of the common MDX functions are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Avg &minus; Returns average value of a numeric expression.</p></li>
<li><p>Count &minus; Returns the number of tuples in one set and also includes null cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Max &minus; Returns the maximum value of a numeric expression.</p></li>
<li><p>Min &minus; Returns the minimum value of a numeric expression.</p></li>
<li><p>Sum &minus; Returns the sum of numeric expression.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are other MDX functions that can be used in dimension formulas.</p>
<p><b>Examples of simple rule formulas</b></p>
<p>[PRODUCT].[PRODUCT1] – [PRODUCT].[PRODUCT2]</p>
<p>[SALES].[SALES1] / [SALES].[SALES2]</p>
<p>Standard Arithmetic functions have to be used in dimension formula - addition (&plus;), subtraction (&minus;), multiplication (*), Division (/) - these are used in SAP NetWeaver.</p>
<p>Once you save the dimension formulas, next is to validate the syntax.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/script_logic1.jpg" alt="Script Logic" />
<p><b>Examples of Advance Rule Formulas</b></p>
<p>This includes movement of calculation dimension formulas from one time period to another.</p>
<p>[AccRec] Accounts Receivable</p>
<p>[AccPay] Accounts Payable</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Mvmt Acc Rec</td>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Movement in Accounts Receivable</td>
<td>(if([Time].CurrentMember.Children.Count = 0,[Account].[AccRec]-([Account].[AccRec],[Time].PrevMember) SUM(Descendants[Time].CurrentMember,[Time].[Month],LEAVES)))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Mvmt inventory</td>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Movement in Inventory</td>
<td>(if([Time].CurrentMember.Children.Count = 0,[Account].[Inventory]-([Account].[Inventory],[Time].PrevMember) SUM(Descendants[Time].CurrentMember,[Time].[Month],LEAVES)))</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Syntax for creating script logic in dimension formulas are already covered.</p>
<p><b>Exceptions in MDX Syntax</b></p>
<p>Following are the exceptions to MDX syntax with BPC &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Replace the keyword AS with an “=” (equal) sign.</li>
<li>Not to use single quotes around expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>[ACCOUNT].[#GROSSSALES] = -[ACCOUNT].[UNITS]*[ACCOUNT].[INPUTPRICE]</p>
<p>[ACCOUNT].[#COST] = -[ACCOUNT].[#GROSSSALES]*80/100</p>
<h2>Worksheet Logic</h2>
<p>All the calculations performed in Excel worksheet is known as Worksheet logic. Worksheet logic includes all the functions that are available in an Excel spreadsheet and functions provided in BPC.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/worksheet_logic.jpg" alt="Worksheet Logic" />
<h1>SAP BPC - Business Functions</h1>
<p>Business Planning and Consolidation performs various business functions such as audit, business process flows, finance statements and reporting, and work status.</p>
<p>Various inbuilt functions are provided to perform these functions.</p>
<h2>Currency Conversion</h2>
<p>Currency conversion is required if your monetary figures are present in more than one currency in your application set. If app set contains monetary figures in single currency, in that case you don’t need a rate application, currency time dimensions, etc.</p>
<p>If most of your data is entered in one currency and you have only few figures in other currency, this can be handled by creating duplicate members in entity dimension. In this case, you can duplicate few entities present in foreign operations to separate local currency from translated amounts.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; The US corporate mostly deals in the US but also has few subsidiaries functioning in other countries like Canada and Mexico.</p>
<h3>Simple Conversion Requirements</h3>
<p>There should be rate application where you store the exchange rates. You should have an account dimension, which includes RATETYPE. Then Entity dimension should include a property CURRENCY. FXTRANS logic should be available and DEFAULT logic should include a call to FXTRANS logic. Entity dimension should include the property TRANSALATE_TO.</p>
<h3>Complex Currency Conversions</h3>
<p>There should be rate application where you store the exchange rates. Application should contain a CURRENCY type dimension. There should be property REPORTING for the CURRENCY dimension. Entity dimension must include the property CURRENCY. Account dimension must include property RATETYPE. FXTRANS logic should be available. DEFAULT logic should include a call to FXTRANS logic.</p>
<h3>Selecting Correct Rate</h3>
<p>All valid rate types corresponds to an account of RATE application and belongs to GROUP FX Rate. If there is any account which is not part of this group, it will be multiplied by a factor 1. You can also define a special case NOTRANS, which results in an account being ignored during the translation.</p>
<p>Cross-rate translation includes multiplying the amount in local currency by ratio between the rate of destination currency and the rate of source currency. Using this, application can use only one table of rates for translating any source currency to destination currency.</p>
<p>You can also define the following default translations using business rules &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using different tables of rate by reporting currency.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying the difference between multiply currencies and divide currencies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Intercompany Eliminations</h3>
<p>To perform currency conversion and intercompany eliminations, you need a dimension type - Intercompany dimension (I). To execute intercompany elimination, an application should have the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Dimension Type “I” for intercompany elimination.</li>
<li>Dimension ”I” should include a property ENTITY.</li>
<li>Account dimension should include the property ELIMACC.</li>
<li>Entity dimension should include the property ELIM.</li>
<li>You should set the appropriate business tables.</li>
<li>There should be DPT package to execute intercompany logic.</li>
</ul>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>Dimension</th>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Length</th>
<th>Content</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account</td>
<td>ELIMACC</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>Valid account</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Entity</td>
<td>ELIM</td>
<td>1 char</td>
<td>It contains ‘Y’ or blank</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intercompany</td>
<td>Entity</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>Entity Id w.r.t Intercompany member</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Currency</td>
<td>Reporting</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>‘Y’ or blank</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Default elimination logic performs the following functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Checks all base level entities where ELIM&lt;&gt;Y.</li>
<li>Restricts currency dimension to all reporting currencies only.</li>
<li>Removes all accounts to be eliminated into desired plug account.</li>
<li>Elimination is performed below first common parent in “elimination entity”.</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP BPC - Process Flow Management</h1>
<p>This is used to manage processes created by users and to create and manage business process flow templates. To manage business process flows, you need to have manage processes task profile.</p>
<p>Process template is defined as business process, which contains all the tasks that is spread across multiple modules of BPC system. It includes step-by-step process flow, user performed activities link, process context and timing when process takes place, all the participants and their roles.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>An area manager entering monthly budget data, which includes each manager creating a process and entering the data for each department.</p>
<p>To create a new Business Process Template, login to Web portal &rarr; Planning and Consolidation Administration.</p>
<p>On the left side, you can see the option of Business Process Flows.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/buisiness_process_flow1.jpg" alt="Business Process Flow" />
<p>Expand this tab and you will see Process Templates and Process Instances.</p>
<p>To create a new Business Process template, go to tab Process Templates. Click ‘&plus;New’.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/buisiness_process_flow2.jpg" alt="Business Process Flow" />
<p>BPC admins are responsible to create and manage process templates. Once process templates are created, the business user can use the templates to create processes.</p>
<h2>Work Status</h2>
<p>Work status is used to lock a region of data in a model. This is used to override user’s member access privilege to write to a particular region.</p>
<p>There are multiple dimensions defined for a region with one property called as OWNER. While defining the work status, following are defined &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Work Status</b> &minus; It belongs to physical state of data.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Security</b> &minus; You can set different level of security on changing data in the system – All or Locked. You can set who can change the work state - Manager or Owner.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Data Update</b> &minus; This defines how data will be updated by the customer.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Push</b> &minus; This option is used to push same work state for all the children of a member.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once work status is defined, they can be used by the users to lock the data for review and approval, etc. To implement e-mail notification of work status, you should set the parameters, APPROVALSTATUSMAIL, APPROVALSTATUSMSG, SMTPPASSWORD, SMTPPORT, SMTP SERVER, SMTPAUTH, etc.</p>
<h2>Defining the Work Status</h2>
<p>Go to Business Planning and Administration &rarr; Features.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/work_status1.jpg" alt="Work Status" />
<p>On the left side, you have Features tab. Expand this tab and you will see Work Status as the first option.</p>
<p>Go to Work Status and on the right side you will get options to create and manage work status.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/work_status2.jpg" alt="Work Status" />
<h2>Controlling the Work Status</h2>
<p>You can define in BPC system, who can change the data. This includes the following access levels &minus;</p>
<h3>Who can change data?</h3>
<p><b>All</b> &minus; This allows all users with appropriate access to change the data.</p>
<p><b>Locked</b> &minus; This locks the change on the data. None can change the data.</p>
<p><b>Manager</b> &minus; Only parents of owners/manager can change the data.</p>
<p><b>Owner</b> - Only the owner can change the data.</p>
<h3>Who can control work status?</h3>
<p><b>Both</b> &minus; If you select both, owner of the specific member ID and the owner of the parent to the specific member ID.</p>
<p><b>Owner</b> &minus; Owner of the specific member ID.</p>
<p><b>Manager</b> &minus; Owner of the parent to member ID.</p>
<h3>Determining Manager or Owner in Base Hierarchies</h3>
<p>Parent member owners act as an owner for that specific parent member ID and work as manager for direct children.</p>
<p>This allows parent member owner to change the work status of direct children. In case you are selecting all children, owner of a parent can update children at all levels.</p>
<p>Base members’ owners act as owner only.</p>
<p>Members with no parent but have children act as their own manager and owner too.</p>
<h3>Controlled by Rule</h3>
<p>An owner is defined by one dimension hierarchy &minus; OWNER dimension.</p>
<p>You can set a work state on a single member ID, in this Manager doesn’t include - All Children.</p>
<p>You can also set work state on multiple member IDs, manager uses Include - All Children.</p>

<h1>SAP BPC - Configuring Elimination</h1>
<p>In BPC, it is necessary to configure intercompany eliminations between subsidiaries or parents to avoid double counting. Intercompany eliminations is performed with help of script logic.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/configuration_elimination.jpg" alt="Configuration Elimination" />
<p>If you have transactions between subsidiaries Co. XP02, XP03, these transactions should be eliminated. These transactions are for intercompany account payable and account receivables, and intercompany sales and cost.</p>
<h2>Configuring Intercompany Eliminations</h2>
<p>Before performing intercompany elimination, you should have the following prerequisites &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A consolidation environment</li>
<li>You should perform currency conversion before elimination.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start with, first create a dimension for IC elimination. Application where you have to perform IC elimination must have dimension of type “I” and “R” for account and rate. Account dimension must have an elimination account property to post IC transfer balances.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">ID</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">EV Description</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Account Dimension Property</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICCost</td>
<td>IC Cost of Sales</td>
<td>ICDiff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICSales</td>
<td>IC Sales</td>
<td>ICDiff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICAccRec</td>
<td>IC Accounts Receivables</td>
<td>ICBal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICAccPay</td>
<td>IC Accounts Payable</td>
<td>ICBal</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Next is to have an Entity dimension with a property ELIM (Y/N) to post elimination entity results. This property is set to “Y” for elimination entity.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/intercompany_elimination1.jpg" alt="Intercompany Elimination" />
<p>Account Dimension “I” should have an ENTITY property and should be maintained &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>XP01_Input</li>
<li>XP02</li>
<li>XP03</li>
<li>XP04</li>
<li>XP05</li>
</ul>
<p>Your currency dimension “R” should have a property ‘Reporting’ and should be maintained &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/intercompany_elimination2.jpg" alt="Intercompany Elimination" />
<p>IC Elimination is managed by inbuilt procedures - INITIALIZE_ELIM and ELIMINATE_ORG. Both of these procedures are maintained in ICELIMWITHCURR.LGL file.</p>
<p>The following logic should be entered in application ICELIM logic file and should be validated and saved.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
//Logic for Intercompany Elimination
//========================================================
*INCLUDE SYSTEM_CONSTANTS.LGL
*SYSLIB ICELIMWITHCURR.LGL
//========================================================
//Elimination logic
for organizations in the hierarchy H1
//========================================================
*INITIALIZE_ELIM()
*ELIMINATE_ORG(H1)
*COMMIT
</pre>
<p>To validate this logic, go to Action pane and select “Validate and save” option.</p>
<p>Once the above configuration is in place, you have to create an input schedule or import package to load the data to be eliminated.</p>
<p>To run the import package for IC elimination, login to BPC Excel. Click on Manage Data and go to Run a Data Management Package.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bpc/images/data_management_package.jpg" alt="Data Management Package" />
<p>Go to Company folder of application, click on Financial Processes &rarr; Select Package IC Eliminations and click ‘Run’.</p>
<p>Once this package is executed successfully, you can check the values of the following components in Profit and Loss statement and balance sheets.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">ICCost</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">IC Cost of Sales</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">ICDiff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICSales</td>
<td>IC Sales</td>
<td>ICDiff</td>

<li>Proportional method</li>
<li>Equity method</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global/Purchase Method</h3>
<p>In this method of consolidation, balance sheet accounts and Profit and Loss accounts are fully included and minority interests are calculated if necessary.</p>
<h3>Proportional Method</h3>
<p>In this method, you include balance sheet and P&amp;L accounts at the percentage of ownership.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; Including P&amp;L statement and balance sheet are included 50% at the percentage of ownership.</p>
<h3>Equity Method</h3>
<p>In this method, you don’t include balance sheet and P&amp;L accounts. However, Net Value and Result of the Period are included.</p>
<h1>SAP BPC - Embedded Environment</h1>
<p>BPC Embedded model is based on Business Warehouse-Integrated Planning (BW-IP) in which it uses BW objects directly. This model is different from Standard model and includes data access to all community users. For Embedded design model, initial versions used were SAP BW Integrated Planning and Planning Application Kit i.e. BW-IP and PAK.</p>
<p>This model provides a different level of data access where master and transactional data from host EDW environment is accessible by the application. In Embedded model, it allows an easy access to transactional and master data within the host BW, and this data is shared with many other users and controlled by the administrator group.</p>
<p>In Embedded model, migration from older versions of BW-IP to this data model is relatively easy and migration from earlier versions like (BPC 10.0 and earlier) is considered as a new implementation.</p>
<p>In short you can say that in embedded model, any number of InfoProviders can be assigned to a single BPC model /application.</p>
<p>Following are the key features and functions offered in BPC 10.1 Embedded model &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It uses exception real-time SAP HANA functionalities and hence safeguards SAP HANA performance through the Planning Application Kit. Using SAP HANA allows to perform certain planning functions like copy, distribute, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>BPC-Integration planning supports the use of real-time InfoProviders and aggregations levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Embedded model supports SAP BW Queries that you can execute directly in the SAP EPM add-in for Microsoft Office.</p></li>
<li><p>Embedded model provides audit functions to allow creating various audit reports and use of the business process flows.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP BW Integrated Planning</h2>
