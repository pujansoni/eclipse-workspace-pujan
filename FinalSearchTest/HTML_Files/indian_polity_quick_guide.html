However, the working with these legislative institutions provided useful experience to Indians, which helped in setting up native institutions in independent India.</p></li>

<h1>Indian Polity - How the Constitution works</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A constitution is a set of fundamental principles according to which a state is constituted or governed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution specifies the basic allocation of power in a State and decides who gets to decide what the laws will be.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution first defines how a Parliament will be organized and empowers the Parliament to decide the laws and policies.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution sets some limitations on the Government as to what extent a Government can impose rules and policies on its citizen. These limits are fundamental in the sense that the Government may never trespass them.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution enables the Government to fulfil the aspirations of a society and create conditions for a just society.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Distribution of Power</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Indian Constitution horizontally distributes power across the three following institutions, as depicted in the following illustration &minus;</p></li>

<h3>The Parliament</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>All the elected representatives collectively form a body called as <b>Parliament</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parliament consists of two houses namely <b>Rajya Sabha</b> (Upper House) and <b>Lok Sabha</b> (Lower House).</p></li>

<img src="images/parliament.jpg" alt="Parliament" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The majority group (elected through the election) in the Parliament is called upon to make the government.</p></li>
<li><p>The government is responsible for making policies and other national decisions, which are generally taken up after intensive debate and meaningful discussions in the parliament.</p></li>
<li><p>The Prime Minister is the head of the government. The prime minister presided over the meetings of the cabinet in which the big decisions are taken.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Executive</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The President of India is the head of the State; however, he/she exercises only nominal powers.</p></li>

<h1>Indian Polity - Fundamental Rights</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Constitution of India listed the rights to the citizens of India that would be specially protected and known as the ‘Fundamental Rights.’</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/fundamental_rights.jpg" alt="Fundamental Rights" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>‘Fundamental’ means the Constitution has separately listed and made special provisions for the protection of ‘Fundamental Rights.’</p></li>
<li><p>Fundamental Rights are different from other rights (i.e. ordinary legal rights) available to the citizens of India.</p></li>
<li><p>Ordinary legal rights are protected and enforced by ordinary law; but Fundamental Rights are protected and guaranteed by the Constitution of India.</p></li>
<li><p>Ordinary Rights may be changed or amended by the legislature by ordinary law making process, but a Fundamental Right may only be changed by amending the Constitution itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Judiciary has the powers and responsibility (assigned by the Constitution) to protect the Fundamental Rights; in case any government’s action violates it.</p></li>
<li><p>Judiciary, if found any act of the government (either by Executive or by Legislature) equivalent to violation of the Fundamental Rights, can be declared that act illegal or restrict them to do further so.</p></li>
<li><p>However, Fundamental Rights have some reasonable restrictions and hence, they are not absolute in nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, the preamble to our Constitution speaks of ensuring all its citizens equality, liberty, and justice. Fundamental Rights put this promise into effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Fundamental Rights are very essential to everyone’s life. They are the basic feature of the Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution of India provides <b>six</b> Fundamental Rights, which are mentioned in Articles 12 to 35 in Part-III (of Constitution).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/rights.jpg" alt="Rights" />
<h2>Right to Equality</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Rule of law is the foundation of Indian democracy that states that the laws apply in the same manner to all, irrespective of a person’s status. It means that the Prime Minister of the country or a poor farmer in a remote village is subject to the same law and equal treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 14 states that the government shall not deny to any person, <i>equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws</i>, which means &minus;</p>

</ul>

<li><p>Article 15 states that no citizen can be discriminated against on the basis of his/her religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/equality.jpg" alt="Equality" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Article 15 further enhanced the Right to Equality by providing that every citizen shall have equal access to public places like shops, restaurants, hotels, and cinema halls. Similarly, there shall be no restriction with regard to the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, playgrounds, and places of public resorts maintained by the government.</p></li>
<li><p>Article 16 states that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment.</p></li>

<li><p>The Fundamental Rights mainly protect the rights of individuals, while the directive principles ensure the well-being of the entire society.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fundamental Rights are justifiable and can be claimed in the court of law, whereas the Directive Principles of State Policy cannot be enforced by the judiciary.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fundamental Rights restrain the government from doing certain things, while the Directive Principles of State Policy insist the government to do certain things.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Regarding the Right to Property, the Constitution made it clear that property could be taken away by the government for public welfare.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1973, the Supreme Court gave a decision that the Right to Property was not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and therefore, the Parliament has the power to abridge this right by an amendment.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1978, the 44th amendment to the Constitution removed the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights and transformed it into a simple legal right under Article 300 A.</p></li>

<h1>Indian Polity - Union Executive</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The organ of a government that primarily looks after the function of implementation and administration is known <b>the Executive</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Executive is the branch of Government accountable for the implementation of laws and policies legislated by the legislature.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Parliamentary form of executive, the Prime Minister is the head of the government and the head of the State may be Monarch (Constitutional Monarchy, e.g. UK) or President (Parliamentary Republic, e.g. India).</p></li>
<li><p>In a Semi-Presidential System, the President is the head of the State and the Prime Minister is the head of the government, e.g. France.</p></li>
<li><p>In a Presidential System, the President is the head of the State as well as the head of government, e.g. the US.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Indian System</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Article 74 (1) of the Indian Constitution states that “there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President who shall in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.”</p></li>
<li><p>The President has a wide range of power including executive, legislative, judicial, and emergency powers. However, in a parliamentary system (e.g. India), these powers are in reality used by the President only on the advice of the Council of Ministers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers have support of the majority in the Lok Sabha and they are the real executive.</p></li>
<li><p>The President is the formal head of the government.</p></li>
<li><p>The Prime Minister is obliged to furnish all the information that the President may call for.</p></li>
<li><p>The Council of Ministers is headed by the Prime Minister.</p></li>
<li><p>In the parliamentary form of executive, it is essential that the Prime Minister has the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha. And the moment the Prime Minister loses this support of the majority; he or she loses the office.</p></li>
<li><p>In case no party is in majority, a few parties can form government ‘<b>in coalition</b>.’</p></li>
<li><p>A Prime Minister has to be a Member of Parliament (MP); however, if someone becomes the Prime Minister without being an MP; in such as case, he or she has to get elected to the Parliament within <b>six</b> months of period.</p></li>
<li><p>The Council of Ministers constitutes not more than 15 percent of a total number of members of the House of the People (91st Amendment).</p></li>
<li><p>Persons selected by the Union Public Service Commission for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) constitute the backbone of the higher level bureaucracy in the States.</p></li>
<li><p>Though IAS and IPS work under the state government, they are appointed by the central government; hence, only the central government can take disciplinary action against them. However, the officers appointed through the State Public Service Commission look after the state administration.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The President</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The President of India is the head of the State. He exercises only nominal powers. His functions are mainly ceremonial in nature like the Queen of Britain.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/pranab_mp.jpg" alt="Pranab MP" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>All the political institutions in India, function in the name of the President of India and the President supervises their functions to bring harmony in their works to achieve the objectives of the State.</p></li>
<li><p>In India, the President is elected, not appointed, (although not elected directly by the people). The President is elected by the Members of Parliament (MPs) and the Members of the Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) of each state.</p></li>
<li><p>Participation of Members of the state’s Legislative Assemblies in the election of the president of India shows that the President of India represents the entire nation. At the same time, the indirect election of the President ensures that he cannot claim popular mandate like that of the Prime Minister and thus remains only a nominal head of the State.</p></li>
<li><p>All major policy decisions and orders of the government are issued in the President’s name.</p></li>
<li><p>The President appoints all the major heads of the institutions of the government, i.e.,</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The appointment of the Chief Justice of India,</p></li>
<li><p>The Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of the states,</p></li>
<li><p>The Governors of the states,</p></li>
<li><p>The Election Commissioners,</p></li>
<li><p>Ambassadors to other countries, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The government of India makes all international treaties and agreements in the name of the President.</p></li>
<li><p>The President is the supreme commander of the defense forces of India.</p></li>
<li><p>However, all these powers are exercised by the President only on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.</p></li>
<li><p>The President can ask the Council of Ministers for reconsideration on any advice (asked to him by the Council of Ministers), but if the Council of Ministers recommend the same advice again, he is bound to act according to it.</p></li>
<li><p>A Bill passed by the Parliament becomes a law only after the President gives assent to it. The President can return a Bill back to the Parliament for reconsideration, but he has to sign it, if the Parliament passes the Bill again (with or without amendment).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Discretionary Power</h3>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In <b>three</b> circumstances, the President can exercise his or her <b>discretionary power</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">

<li><p>The President has veto power (also known as ‘pocket veto’) by which he or she can withhold or refuse to give his or her assent to any Bill (other than Money Bill) passed by the Parliament. It happened once, i.e. in 1986, President Gyani Zail Singh withheld the “Indian Post Office (amendment) Bill.”</p></li>
<li><p>The President appoints the Prime Minister.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vice President</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Vice President is elected for <b>five</b> years and the election method is similar to that of the President; however, the only difference is that the members of State legislatures do not participate in the Electoral process.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vice President acts as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vice President takes over the office of the President when there is a vacancy by reasons of death, resignation, removal by impeachment, or otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>The Vice President may be removed from his or her office by a Resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by a majority and agreed to by the Lok Sabha.</p></li>

<li><p>The Parliament is the central legislature and the legislature of the state is known as ‘State Legislature.’</p></li>
<li><p>The Parliament of India is <b>bicameral</b> (i.e. consists of two houses) namely <b>Rajya Sabha</b> (the Council of States) and <b>Lok Sabha</b> (the House of the People).</p></li>

<li><p>In the U.S.A, every state has equal representation in the Senate irrespective of size and population of the states, but in India, it is not the same.</p></li>
<li><p>In India, states with larger size of population get more representatives than states with smaller population. For example, Uttar Pradesh (the most populated state) sends 31 members to Rajya Sabha; on the other hand, Sikkim (the least populated state) sends only one member to Rajya Sabha.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of members to be elected from each State has been fixed by the fourth schedule of the Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Members of the Rajya Sabha are elected for a term of <b>six</b> years and then they can be re-elected.</p></li>
<li><p>Members of Rajya Sabha are elected in such a manner that they do not complete their tenure altogether; rather after every two years, one-third member complete their term and elections are held for those one-third seats only.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, the Rajya Sabha never gets fully dissolved and hence, it is known as the <b>permanent House</b> of the Parliament.</p></li>
<li><p>Apart from the elected members, the President appoints <b>12</b> members from the fields of literature, science, art, and social service.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lok Sabha</h2>

<li><p>After the independence, a three-tier Panchayati Raj system of local government was recommended for the rural areas; resultantly, some of the states including Gujarat and Maharashtra adopted the system of elected local bodies (1960).</p></li>
<li><p>After 1987, a thorough review of the functioning of local government institutions was initiated and in 1989, the P. K. Thungon Committee recommended constitutional recognition to the local government bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in 1992, the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments were passed by the Parliament.</p></li>
<li><p>The 73rd Amendment is about the rural local governments, which are also known as Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).</p></li>

<li><p>The judiciary is supreme in settling disputes and deciding whether the laws that have been made are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In a landmark judgment of <i>Kesavananda Bharati</i> case (1973), the Supreme Court ruled that there is a ‘<b>Basic Structure</b>’ of the Constitution and nobody — not even the Parliament (through amendment)— can violate the basic structure.</p></li>
<li><p>In <i>Kesavananda Bharati</i> case, the Supreme Court did two things &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>It said that right to property was not part of the basic structure and therefore could be suitably amended.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court reserved to itself the right to decide whether various matters are part of the basic structure of the Constitution.</p></li>

<h1>Indian Polity - Federal System</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Federalism is an institutional mechanism to accommodate two sets of polities, i.e., first is the center or national level and second is at the provincial or regional level. Both the sets of polities are autonomous in its own sphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Each level of the polity has distinct powers and responsibilities and has a separate system of government.</p></li>
<li><p>The details of this federalism or dual system of government are generally found in a written constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Written Constitution is considered to be supreme and also the source of the power of both sets of government.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain subjects, which are the concern of a nation as a whole, for example, defense or currency, are the responsibility of the union or central government.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, regional or local matters are the responsibility of the regional or state government.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of a conflict between the center and the state on any issue, the judiciary has the powers to resolve the disputes.</p></li>
<li><p>Though the Indian Constitution does not use the word ‘federalism’ anywhere; however, the structure of Indian government is divided into two sets of governments i.e.</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>For the entire nation known as the ‘<b>Union Government</b>’ (or central government) and</p></li>
<li><p>For each unit or state known as the ‘<b>State Government</b>.’</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the basic structure of “Federal System” &minus;</p>
<img src="images/federal_system.jpg" alt="Federal System" />
<h2>Subjects of Federal System</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Constitution clearly demarcates subjects, which are under the exclusive domain of the Union and those under the exclusive of States.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, the Constitution describes three lists &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Union List (subjects dealt by only Central Government);</p></li>
<li><p>State List (subjects dealt normally by States only); and</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrent List (both Union and State have the power to legislate these subjects).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Union List</h3>

<li>Adoption and Succession</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Facts</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Article 257 of the Constitution is read as: The executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union, and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>Sarkaria</i> Commission was appointed by the central government in 1983 to examine the issues relating to center-State relations; the Commission submitted its report in 1988 and recommended that appointments of Governors should be strictly non-partisan.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1953, the States Reorganization Commission was set up and it recommended the creation of linguistic States, at least for the major linguistic groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Resultantly, Gujarat and Maharashtra were created in 1960 and the process is still going on.</p></li>
<li><p>The Constitution of India (under Article 371) has given some special provisions for some States after considering their peculiar social and historical circumstances. However, most of the special provisions are related to the north eastern States (i.e. Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, etc.) largely due to a sizeable indigenous tribal population with a distinct history and culture.</p></li>
<li><p>Under Article 370 of the Constitution, the northern most state Jammu and Kashmir has also special provisions.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the major differences between the other States and the State of J&amp;K are that no emergency due to internal disturbances can be declared in J&amp;K without the concurrence of the State.</p></li>
<li><p>The Union Government cannot impose a financial emergency in J&amp;K and the Directive Principles also do not apply in J&amp;K.</p></li>
<li><p>An amendment to the Indian Constitution (under Art. 368) can only apply in concurrence with the government of J&amp;K.</p></li>

<h1>Indian Polity - Elections System</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In India, there are three levels of government, i.e.,</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li>Center level,</li>
<li>State level, and</li>
<li>Local level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>At center level, elections are conducted to elect Member of Parliament, which is known as Lok Sabha elections.</p></li>
<li><p>For Lok Sabha election, the whole country is divided into <b>543 constituencies</b> and each constituency elects one representative as a Member of Parliament (MP).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/election_system.jpg" alt="Election System" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>At the State level, an election is called assembly election; however, unlike center, each state is divided into a different specific number of Assembly constituencies.</p></li>
<li><p>The elected representative in the assembly election is called as the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA).</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, at the local level, elections are held for the election of <i>Pradhan</i> in Panchayat (rural) areas and counselor in Municipal (urban) areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Each village or town is divided into several ‘<b>wards</b>’ (similar to constituencies) and each ward elects one member of the village or the urban local body respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reserved Constituencies</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Every citizen of India has the right to vote to elect a representative as well as to be elected as a representative.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide a fair opportunity to a candidate belonging to weaker sections in an open electoral competition (against those who are influential and resourceful), a system of ‘<b>reserved</b>’ constituency is adopted.</p></li>
<li><p>The reserved system ensures equal opportunity to all and provides a real choice of election to the voters from weaker sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Some constituencies are reserved for the people belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in a proportion of their population in the respective regions.</p></li>
<li><p>In a reserved constituency, only the persons belonging to the reserved category are eligible to contest an election.</p></li>
<li><p>As on 1 September 2012, 84 seats were reserved for SC Category and 47 seats were reserved for ST Category in Lok Sabha.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, 33% of the seats are reserved in rural and urban local bodies for women candidates.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Voting System</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The principle of a universal adult franchise is the foundation of the democracy that gives every citizen a right to have one vote and each vote should have equal value.</p></li>
<li><p>Every citizen of 18 years or more has the right to vote, irrespective of his caste, religion, gender, educational qualification, financial status, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure that not even a single person is denied of this basic right for any reason whatsoever, a list of all voters (eligible to vote) is prepared. This list is officially called as the <b>Electoral Roll</b> or the <b>Voters’ List</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The voters’ list is provided to the voters of each constituency much before the election for the purpose of inspection and correction.</p></li>
<li><p>On the day of election, the people cast their votes as per their names mentioned in the voter list.</p></li>
<li><p>This method ensures that not a single person is denied his/her right to vote and thus everyone should get an equal opportunity to choose their representatives.</p></li>
<li><p>The government is responsible to update the voter’s list before the election; new names of all the eligible voters are added to the voters’ list and names of those who move out from their residential place or those who have been died are deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>A complete revision of the voter’s list takes place every five years.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nomination of Candidates</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In a democratic country, a system of free and fair election provides the people of every section a real choice to vote and a fair chance to contest. There are no restrictions on anyone to contest an election except in reserved constituencies.</p></li>
<li><p>To contest an election, a candidate should be of 25 years (or more) of age with sound mind and no criminal background.</p></li>
<li><p>Political parties introduce their candidates and give them the party ‘ticket’.</p></li>
<li><p>A candidate who wishes to contest an election has to fill a ‘nomination form’ and deposit some money as ‘security fees.’</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/candidate_nomination.jpg" alt="Nomination of Candidates" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Besides, the Supreme Court has also given directions that every contesting candidate has to disclose his/her personal information to the voters. So that the voter can choose a right candidate on the basis of given information.</p></li>
<li><p>Following the directions of the Supreme Court, the Election Commission of India put in place a system of a declaration on an affidavit.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed candidate has to make a legal declaration, giving full details of his &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Criminal cases pending against the candidate;</p></li>
<li><p>Details of the assets and liabilities of the candidate and his or her family;</p></li>
<li><p>Education qualifications of the candidate.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Educational Qualifications for Candidates</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In the Indian political system, educational qualification is not required, either for the voters or for the contesting candidates.</p></li>
<li><p>Politics in India does not require educational qualifications of a person for selection to be a leader. It is just like the criteria for selection in a cricket team, the ability of the player to play cricket and not his educational qualification.</p></li>
<li><p>The essential qualification for an MLA or an MP in politics is their ability to understand people’s concerns, problems, and to represent their interests.</p></li>
<li><p>It is left upon the voters to decide whether their representative is qualified to understand their problems and able to solve them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Election Campaign</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The main purpose of an election is to give the people a chance to choose their representatives and make a government of their choice who frames policies to address their concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>During election campaigns, voters get the opportunity to have a free and open discussion about who is a better candidate, which party can give a better government, or what are their policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/election_campaign.jpg" alt="Election Campaign" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In India, election campaigns take place for two weeks period between the announcement of the final list of candidates and the date of polling.</p></li>
<li><p>During campaigns, the political leaders address election rallies and political parties mobilize their supporters.</p></li>
<li><p>The contesting candidates contact their voters through various methods such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>They advertise in newspapers, radio, television, etc.;</p></li>
<li><p>They publish pamphlets and distribute them in their respective constituencies;</p></li>
<li><p>They arrange rallies and give speeches at every public place of their constituencies;</p></li>
<li><p>They tell their voters about their plan and policies and also ask about their (voters’) problems.</p></li>
<li><p>They try to convince their voters in their favor and appeal them to vote and elect the right candidate.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Indian election system is based on the law, which provides a code of conduct for every person contesting an election.</p></li>
<li><p>If any political party or candidate violates this code of conduct, his/her election can be rejected by the court even after they have been declared elected.</p></li>
<li><p>This code of conduct states that no party or candidate can &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Bribe or threaten voters;</p></li>
<li><p>Appeal/mesmerize them (voters) in the name of caste or religion;</p></li>
<li><p>Use government resources for election campaign;</p></li>
<li><p>Spend more than Rs.25 lakh in a constituency for a Lok Sabha election;</p></li>
<li><p>Spend more than Rs.10 lakh in a constituency for an Assembly election.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In addition to the laws, all the political parties in India have agreed to a Model Code of Conduct for election campaigns. According to this, no party or candidate can &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Use any place of worship for election propaganda;</p></li>
<li><p>Use government vehicles, aircraft, and officials for elections;</p></li>
<li><p>Once elections are announced, Ministers shall not lay foundation stones of any projects;</p></li>
<li><p>Take any big policy decisions or make any promises of providing public facilities.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Any violation of any rule needs to be reported to the Election Commission, which has sufficient power and authority to take appropriate action against the violators.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Polling and Counting of Votes</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Election Commission of India prepares a timetable for election. A particular day is fixed for polling in a particular constituency. This is called election day, usually, it is declared as a holiday.</p></li>
<li><p>Voters whose name is on the voters’ list go to a nearby ‘polling booth’ and cast their vote one by one.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/counting_votes.jpg" alt="Counting of Votes" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Inside the polling booth, the election officials identify the voter as per their name in the voter list (and also check their Identity Card).</p></li>
<li><p>After identifying the right voter, the election officials put a mark on the left hand index finger, and then allow to cast a vote.</p></li>
<li><p>Polling officers keep the records of those who have cast their votes and maintain a proper register.</p></li>
<li><p>A <b>ballot paper</b> is a sheet of paper comprising a list of names of all the contesting candidates along with party name and symbols.</p></li>
<li><p>Earlier, the voters used to mark their choice by putting a stamp on the <b>ballot paper</b> against the name and mark of the candidate of their choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowadays, electronic voting machines (EVM) are used to cast the votes; the machine shows the names of the candidate and the party symbols (as shown in the given image).</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/ballot_unit.jpg" alt="Ballot Unit" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>A voter needs to press the button against the name of the candidate who he/she wants to elect.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the polling is over, all the EVMs are sealed and taken to a centralized place where all the EVMs are kept and later on, votes were counted.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Independent Election Commission</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Elections in our country are conducted through a powerful and independent institution called the Election Commission of India.</p></li>
<li><p>The Election Commission of India is a constitutional body which is an autonomous body independent of the government. It enjoys the same kind of independence like the judges of the Supreme Court of India.</p></li>
<li><p>The Chief Election Commission of India (CEC) is appointed by the President of India, but after his appointment, the Chief Election Commissioner is not answerable to the President or the government.</p></li>
<li><p>In a matter of election, it has been given wide powers to conduct free and fair election. They actively use these powers to form fair government.</p></li>
<li><p>The government or the ruling party has no occasion to influence or pressurize the election commission.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Role of Election Commission</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The Election Commission takes decisions on every aspect related to the election from the announcement of elections to the declaration of results.</p></li>
<li><p>The Election Commission supervises and controls the administration of elections. It checks and correct any fault immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>The Election Commission implements the Code of Conduct and punishes any candidate or party who is found guilty of any violation.</p></li>
<li><p>During the election period, the Election Commission acquires powers to order the government to follow settled guidelines to prevent use and misuse of governmental power to enhance its chances to win elections, or to transfer some government officials.</p></li>
<li><p>All the officers and staff of the government that is put on election duty works under the control of the Election Commission and not under the government.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Acceptance of Election Outcome</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The electoral outcomes in India are usually accepted as people’s verdict by the defeated candidates or party.</p></li>
<li><p>The test of the free and fair election in India manifested in the outcome of the election result.</p></li>
<li><p>In India, the result of election frequently changes the ruling government, which clearly illustrates that the elections in India are free and fair.</p></li>
<li><p>The ruling parties routinely lose elections in India, both at the national and state level. In fact, in every two out of the three elections held in the last fifteen years, the ruling party lost.</p></li>

<h1>Indian Polity - Environment &amp; Politics</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In the present world, cultivable area is barely expanding any more, and a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility (transforming into barren land or desert).</p></li>
<li><p>Grasslands have been overgrazed; fisheries overharvested; water bodies have suffered extensive depletion; and pollution, severely restricting food production.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/environmental_issues.jpg" alt="Environment Issues" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>According to the Human Development Report 2006 of the United Nations Development Program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>About 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and</p></li>
<li><p>About 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>These problems collectively causing the death of more than three million children every year.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural forest’s areas are steadily decreasing across the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Depletion of ozone layer and global warming are other major threats to the ecosystems.</p></li>
<li><p>In the present context, the issues of environment and natural resources are political in deeper sense (and part of the world politics).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>International Programs</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 1972, the Club of Rome, a global think tank, published a book titled as “<b>Limits to Growth</b>,” dramatizing the potential depletion of the Earth’s resources against the backdrop of swiftly growing world population.</p></li>
<li><p>United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and other international and regional organizations began holding international conferences and promoting detailed studies to get a more coordinated and effective response to environmental problems, as it already became a significant issue of global politics.</p></li>
<li><p>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in <b>Rio de Janeiro</b>, Brazil, in June <b>1992</b> (also known as the <b>Earth Summit</b>) was the beginning of international effort on global scale.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rio Summit produced conventions dealing with climate change, biodiversity, forestry, and recommended a list of development practices called ‘<b>Agenda 21</b>’.</p></li>
<li><p>First World, generally refer to the ‘<b>global North</b>’ were pursuing a different environmental agenda than the poor and developing countries of the Third World, called the ‘<b>global South</b>’.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, the Northern states are largely concerned with ozone depletion and global warming, the Southern states are anxious to address the relationship between economic development and environmental management.</p></li>
<li><p>Some critics however have pointed out that the Agenda 21 was biased in favor of economic growth rather than ensuring ecological conservation.</p></li>
<li><p>‘<b>Commons</b>’ in a global political sense are those resources, which are not owned by anyone, but rather shared by a community.</p></li>
<li><p>The areas or regions of the world, which are located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any one state, and, therefore require common governance by the international community.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of ‘<b>global commons</b>’ are the earth’s atmosphere, Antarctica, the ocean floor (and the high seas i.e. beyond the 200 nautical miles from the respective coast), and outer space.</p></li>
<li><p>For the global consensus, there have been many path-breaking agreements such as the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, the 1987 Montreal Protocol, and the 1991 Antarctic Environmental Protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>However, a major problem underlying all ecological issues relates to the difficulty of achieving consensus on common environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also discussed that the parties should act to protect the climate system “on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common, but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.”</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/environmental_problems.jpg" alt="Environmental Problems" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <b>Kyoto Protocol</b> (1997, Kyoto, Japan) is an international agreement that sets targets for industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. However, India, China, and other developing countries are exempted.</p></li>
<li><p>India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in August 2002.</p></li>
<li><p>The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and indispensable fuel.</p></li>
<li><p>The World Council of Indigenous People was formed in 1975.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Indian Polity - Globalization</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>It would be incorrect to assume that globalization has purely economic dimensions; it is a multidimensional concept, which includes political, economic, cultural, and ideological manifestations.</p></li>
<li><p>The impact of globalization is greatly uneven, as it affects some societies more than others and some parts of some societies more than others.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/globalization.jpg" alt="Globalization" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Globalization has a strong historical basis, and it is important to view contemporary flows against this backdrop.</p></li>
<li><p>The technological advancement is one of the most major causes of globalization.</p></li>
<li><p>WTO and IMF though are the major players, but Economic globalization involves many other factors as well.</p></li>
<li><p>What is often called economic globalization usually involves greater economic flows among different countries of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Many economists and other experts are worried that globalization is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for jobs and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>It has been emphasized that the policy would ensure institutional safeguards or create ‘social safety nets’ to minimize the negative effects of globalization on those who are economically weak.</p></li>
<li><p>Many experts believe that the social safety net is not sufficient to safeguard the needs of economically weak class. This is the reason that some economists and other scholars describe the globalization as “<b>re-colonization</b>.” However, supporters argue that greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does best and benefits every class of economy.</p></li>
<li><p>As per the cultural perspective, globalization leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called as <b>cultural homogenization</b>. For example, ‘<b>McDonaldization</b>.’</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/macd.jpg" alt="Mac D" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Cultural homogenization is dangerous not only for the poor countries, but also for the whole of humanity; it leads to the shrinking of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Critics of Globalization</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The critics of globalization make a variety of arguments such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The leftist people argue that contemporary globalization represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer (and fewer) and the poor poorer.</p></li>
<li><p>But it is interesting to note here that anti-globalization movements to participate in global networks, allying with those who feel like them in other countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, many anti-globalization movements are not opposed to the idea of globalization <i>per se</i> as much as they are opposed to a specific program of globalization, which they see as a form of imperialism.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, in 1999, at the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Meeting, it is argued that the interests of the developing world were not given sufficient importance in the evolving global economic system and policy.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>World Social Forum</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The World Social Forum (WSF) is another global platform, which brings together a wide coalition composed of human rights activists, environmentalists, labor, youth, and women activists in order to oppose the neo-liberal globalization.</p></li>
<li><p>The first WSF meeting was organized in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 2001 and the fourth WSF meeting was held in Mumbai in 2004 and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>In India, there have been left wing protests to economic liberalization.</p></li>
<li><p>These leftist people voiced through political parties as well as through forums like the Indian Social Forum.</p></li>
<li><p>Trade unions of industrial workforce as well as those representing farmers’ interest have organized protests against the entry of multinationals.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Indian Polity - Popular Movements</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the 1970s, in some parts of Uttarakhand, villagers protested against the practices of commercial logging that the government had permitted.</p></li>
</ul>
<a href="images/chipko_movement.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/chipko_movement.jpg" class="examsimg" alt="Chipko movement" /></a>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>To protect the trees, the villagers used a novel tactic. They used to hug the trees to prevent them from being cut down; this method became popular as ‘<b>Chipko Movement</b>’ (as shown in the image given below).</p></li>
<li><p>The movement took up economic issues of landless forest workers and asked for guarantees of a minimum wage.</p></li>
<li><p>The movement achieved a victory when the government issued a ban on cutting of trees in the Himalayan regions for fifteen years, until the green cover was fully restored.</p></li>
<li><p>In spite of the impressive growth in many sectors of the economy in the first twenty years of independence, poverty and inequalities still remain a great problem; probably, because benefits of economic growth did not reach evenly to all sections of the society.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Evolution of Voluntary Organizations</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Many of the politically active groups lost their faith in existing democratic institutions and electoral politics and some groups therefore chose to step outside of party politics and got engage in mass mobilization for registering their protests.</p></li>
<li><p>The middle class young activists launched service organizations and constructive programs among rural poor.</p></li>
<li><p>As these works were voluntary in nature (social work), many of these organizations came to known as voluntary organizations or voluntary sector organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Since these voluntary organizations decided to remain outside of the politics and do not contest election; hence, they became popular as ‘non-party political formation.’</p></li>
<li><p><b>Dalit Panthers</b>, a militant organization of the Dalit youth, was formed in Maharashtra in 1972.</p></li>
<li><p>In the post-independence period, Dalit groups were mainly fighting against the perpetual caste based inequalities and material injustices that they faced in spite of constitutional guarantees of equality and justice</p></li>
<li><p>In the 1980s, farmers’ dissension was also rising, which gave birth to farmers’ agitation against the government’s decision (especially increasing the electricity rate).</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>Bharatiya Kisan Union</b> (BKU) was one of the leading organizations (exclusively involved for the farmers’ movement) during the period of eighties.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/bhartiye_kisan.jpg" alt="Bharatiya Kisan" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Activities conducted by the BKU to pressurize the state through rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins, and <i>jail bharo</i> (courting imprisonment) agitations to get their demands accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>Dissented Fish workers, especially from Kerala, took the main responsibility of mobilizing fellow workers, including women workers from other States.</p></li>
<li><p>When the government’s deep sea fishing policy (1991) that opened up India’s waters to large commercial vessels including those of the multinational fishing companies came into existence, work of the National Fish Workers’ Forum (NFF) consolidated its first legal battle with the Union government successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>Another movement initiated by women was the movement against the sale of liquor/alcohol. Women in Nellore came together in spontaneous local initiatives to protest against arrack and forced closure of the wine shop.</p></li>
<li><p>In the 1988-89, <i>Narmada Bachao Aandolan</i> (NBA), a movement to save the Narmada, opposed the construction of these dams and questioned the nature of ongoing developmental projects in the country.</p></li>
<li><p>NBA continued a sustained agitation for more than twenty years and used every available democratic strategy to put forward its demands.</p></li>
<li><p>The movement for Right to Information (RTI) is commenced in 1990, when a mass-based organization called the <i>Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan</i> (MKSS) in Rajasthan took the initiative in demanding records of famine relief work and accounts of laborers.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/rti.jpg" alt="RTI" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>These movements suggest that the routine functioning of democracy did not have enough space for the voices of these social groups; therefore, the real-life impact of these movements on the nature of public policies seems to be very limited.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Indian Polity - Foreign Policy</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>During the period immediately after the second world War, the world divided into two clear poles — one was under the influence of the <b>United States</b> and its western allies and the other was under the influence of the then <b>Soviet Union</b>.</p></li>

<img src="images/nehru_policy.jpg" alt="Nehru Policy" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The <b>three</b> major objectives of Nehru’s foreign policy were &minus;</p>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>To preserve the hard-earned sovereignty,</p></li>
<li><p>To protect territorial integrity, and</p></li>
<li><p>To promote rapid economic development.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>To achieve these three objectives, Pandit Nehru adopted the strategy of nonalignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of its nonalignment policy, in 1956, when Britain attacked Egypt over the Suez Canal issue, India led the world protest against this neo-colonial invasion.</p></li>
<li><p>However, while India was trying to convince the other developing countries about the policy of non-alignment, Pakistan joined the US-led military alliances.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Nehru had been remained an ardent advocate of Asian unity.</p></li>
<li><p>The Afro-Asian conference that held in the Indonesian city of Bandung in 1955, commonly known as the Bandung Conference, recognized as the zenith of India’s engagement with the newly independent Asian and African nations.</p></li>
<li><p>Later, the <b>Bandung Conference</b> led to the establishment of the <b>Non-Aligned Movement</b> (NAM) and Pandit Nehru was the co-founder of the NAM.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/nam.jpg" alt="Nam" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>The First Summit of the <b>NAM</b> was held in <b>Belgrade</b> in September 1961.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Bilateral Agreements</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p><b><i>Panchsheel</i></b> was the joint effort under which, the <b>Five Principles</b> of Peaceful Coexistence, by the Indian Prime Minister Nehru and the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was signed on 29 April 1954 in the direction of stronger relationship between the two countries.</p></li>
<li><p>In spite of the ‘<i>Panchsheel Agreement</i>,’ between the period of 1957 and 1959, the Chinese occupied the Aksai-chin area and built a strategic road there.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, China launched a swift and massive invasion in October 1962 on both the disputed regions i.e. Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir.</p></li>
<li><p>A long-term dispute between India and Pakistan about the sharing of river water was resolved through mediation by the World Bank. Resultantly, the India-Pakistan Indus Waters Treaty was signed by Nehru and General Ayub Khan in 1960.</p></li>
<li><p>An armed conflict between India and Pakistan began in 1965; at that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri was the Prime Minister of India. The hostilities came to an end with the UN intervention.</p></li>
<li><p>Later, the-then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan’s General Ayub Khan signed the <b>Tashkent Agreement</b> in January 1966, and it was mediated by the Soviet Union.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/taskant.jpg" alt="Taskant" />
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>In 1971, the US and China supported Pakistan.</p></li>
<li><p>India signed a 20-year Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Soviet Union in August 1971 to counter the US-Pakistan-China axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Pakistan’s attack on India in December 1971, was the major loss for both the countries; secondly, because of this war, East Pakistan became an Independent country as Bangladesh.</p></li>
<li><p>The dispute was resolved through the signing of the <b>Shimla Agreement</b> between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on July 3, 1972.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="images/shimala_agreement.jpg" alt="Shimala Agreement" />
<h2>Nuclear Development</h2>
<ul class="list examslist">
<li><p>Another important development of this period was the first nuclear explosion undertaken by India in May 1974.</p></li>
<li><p>When Communist China conducted nuclear tests in October 1964, the five nuclear weapon powers i.e. the US, the USSR, the UK, France, and China (the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council) tried to impose the <b>Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty</b> (NPT) of 1968 on the rest of the world. However, India always considered the NPT as discriminatory and had refused to sign it.</p></li>
<li><p>India conducted a series of nuclear tests in May 1998, demonstrating its capacity to use nuclear energy for military purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the period of 1990, Russia was the important political friend of India, but after the period of 1990, Russia, though it continues to be an important friend of India, has lost its global preeminence and India’s pro-US policy started developing.</p></li>
<li><p>India’s foreign policy is always dictated by ideas of national interest.</p></li>
