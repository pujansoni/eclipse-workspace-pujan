<h1>SAP FI - Journal Entry Posting</h1>
<p>The use of Journal Entry (JE) posting in SAP FI is to take a batch, validate it for consistency, and create FI documents and post those entries in various line item accounts needed for subsequent business processing.</p>
<p>JE Posting is a process that, with a few exceptions, runs "behind the scenes" and is the heart of Journal Entry. It receives journal entry data (representing financial transactions) from the PRA modules (Valuation, Revenue Distribution, etc.), and summarizes them in batches and posts them to the PRA JE line item tables and to SAP FI.</p>
<p>Journal Entry Posting is the link between the journal entries coming from PRA applications and the FI documents and JE line item table items that are created.</p>

<h1>SAP FI - Accounts Receivable</h1>
<p>SAP FI Accounts Receivable component records and manages accounting data of all customers. It is also an integral part of sales management.</p>
<p>All postings in Accounts Receivable are also recorded directly in the General Ledger. Different G/L accounts are updated depending on the transaction involved (for example, receivables, down payments, and bills of exchange). The system contains a range of tools that you can use to monitor open items such as account analyses, alarm reports, due date lists, and a flexible dunning program.</p>
<p>The correspondence linked to these tools can be individually formulated to suit your requirements. This is also the case for payment notices, balance confirmations, account statements, and interest calculations. Incoming payments can be assigned to due receivables using user-friendly screen functions or by electronic means such as EDI.</p>
<p>The payment program can automatically carry out direct debiting and down-payments.</p>
<p>We have a range of tools available for documenting the transactions that occur in Accounts Receivable, including balance lists, journals, balance audit trails, and other standard reports. When drawing up financial statements, the items in foreign currency are revalued, customers who are also vendors are listed, and the balances on the accounts are sorted by their remaining life.</p>
<p>Accounts Receivable is not merely one of the branches of accounting that forms the basis of adequate and orderly accounting. It also provides the data required for effective credit management (as a result of its close integration with the Sales and Distribution component) as well as important information for the optimization of liquidity planning.</p>
<h1>SAP FI - Customer Master Data</h1>
<p>In SAP FI, all business transactions are posted to and managed in accounts. You must create a master record for each account that you require.

<h1>SAP FI - AR Invoice Processes</h1>
<p>In addition to invoicing processes delivered by SAP, you can define your own invoicing processes. For each process, you can adjust the behavior of the SAP invoicing program to your own requirements such that only the required invoicing functions are run and under the consideration of your individual settings for these functions. This flexibility is in addition to non-modification enhancement which includes BAdIs, and events.</p>
<p>Invoicing processes are used as selection parameters for mass activities for "Invoicing in Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable".</p>
<p>Number ranges for invoicing documents are defined dependent on the invoicing processes.</p>
<p>Invoicing processes are a differentiation characteristic for the activation of optional invoicing functions.</p>

You define the criteria for creating the invoicing units for the invoicing process.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Processing of Billing Documents</b> &minus; The billing documents selected for an invoicing unit are included in the invoicing document. The billing document items are linked with the items of the invoicing document, and the derivations required for the posting in "Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable" (FI-CA) are performed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Performance of Additional Functions</b> &minus; In addition to processing billing documents, in "Invoicing in Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable" , you can integrate further functions of FI-CA. For example, interest calculation, creation of dunning proposals, or the calculation of charges and discounts. You define which additional functions are performed for each invoicing process.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Account Maintenance</b> &minus; Using the account maintenance integrated in "Invoicing in Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable", you can perform clearing between the posting documents entered in Invoicing and the open items of the contract account posted before invoicing. You define the criteria for clearing in the clearing control.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Update</b> &minus; The invoicing document created for the invoicing unit and the posting documents are written to the database. The invoicing orders processed are deleted.

<h1>SAP FI - AA Overview</h1>
<p>The FI-Asset Accounting (FI-AA) component is used for managing the fixed assets in FI system. In Financial Accounting, it serves as a subsidiary ledger to the General Ledger, providing detailed information on transactions involving fixed assets.</p>
<p><b>Integration with other components</b> &minus; As a result of the integration in the SAP system, Asset Accounting (FI-AA) transfers data directly to and from other SAP components.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>It is possible to post from the Materials Management (MM) component directly to FI-AA. When an asset is purchased or produced in-house, you can directly post the invoice receipt or goods receipt, or the withdrawal from the warehouse, to assets in the "Asset Accounting" component.</p>
<p>At the same time, you can pass on depreciation and interest directly to the "Financial Accounting" (FI) and "Controlling" (CO) components. From the "Plant Maintenance" (PM) component, you can settle maintenance activities that require capitalization to assets.</p> 
<h2>Components of Asset Accounting</h2>
<p>The "Asset Accounting" component consists of the following parts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Traditional asset accounting</li>
<li>Processing leased assets</li>
<li>Preparation for consolidation</li>
<li>Information System</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional asset accounting encompasses the entire lifetime of the asset from purchase order or the initial acquisition through its retirement. The system calculates, to a large extent automatically, the values for depreciation, interest, insurance and other purposes between these two points in time, and places this information at your disposal in varied from using the Information System. There is a report for depreciation forecasting and simulation of the development of asset values.</p>
<p>The system also offers special functions for leased assets, and assets under construction. The system enables you to manage values in parallel currencies using different types of valuation. These features simplify the process of preparing for the consolidation of multinational group concerns.</p>
<p>The "Plant Maintenance" (PM) component offers functions for the technical management of assets in the form of functional locations and as equipment. The "Treasury" (TR) component offers special functions for managing financial assets.</p>
<h2>Create New Asset Classes</h2>
<p>Use the <b>T-code</b> OAOA or go to SPRO &#8594; SAP Reference IMG &#8594; Financial Accounting &#8594; Asset Accounting &#8594; Organizational Structure &#8594; Asset Classes &#8594; Define Asset Classes &#8594; Execute.</p>

<h1>SAP FI - AA Asset Explorer</h1>
<p>This function shows all the values of a fixed asset, including APC values and depreciation, in various forms and summarization levels. Planned values are displayed as well as the values already posted. You use this function to display and analyze asset values.</p>
<h2>Components of Asset Explorer</h2> 
<p>Asset Explorer consists of the following components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Header</b> &minus; This is the field where you enter the company code and asset number.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Overview tree</b> &minus; Using overview tree, you can navigate between different depreciation areas. Overview tree displays objects related to the asset.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Tab</b> &minus; This is where you analyze plan values and posted values using different parameters, and compare fiscal years and depreciation areas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The Asset Explorer uses ALV Grid Control for its table display. You can use it to specify the contents of the columns.</p>
<h2>Header</h2>
<p>With the company code and main asset number, you can also enter the asset sub-number. If you enter an asterisk (*) in the sub number field, the Asset Explorer shows all transactions and depreciation of all sub numbers of the asset main number. Use “This graphic” is explained in the accompanying text and “This graphic” is explained in the accompanying text icons to navigate to different fiscal years.</p>
<h2>Overview Tree for Depreciation Areas</h2> 
<p>Choose the pushbutton above the overview tree, or “this graphic” is explained in the accompanying text Display master data function, to reach the display transaction for asset master data.</p>
<p>To navigate between depreciation areas in the overview tree, select the depreciation area you want. Icons indicate the type of depreciation area. This graphic is explained in the accompanying text icon indicates a real depreciation area, and the “This graphic” is explained in the accompanying text icon indicates a derived depreciation area.</p>
<h2>Overview Tree for Related Objects</h2> 
<p>The system automatically searches for objects related to the asset, such as cost center, equipment, G/L account, WBS element, and displays them in an overview tree. From this overview tree, you can jump directly to the display transaction of the given master data.</p>
<p>There are additional options if the asset was created or posted from a purchase order. In that case, you can double click on the Purchase Orders folder to go to a report that displays all Materials Management documents that are linked to the asset.</p>
<p>When you enter an asterisk (*) for the sub-number in the Asset Explorer, the search for related objects is deactivated. On the Planned Values, Posted Values, and Comparisons tab pages, the system shows the total of all sub-numbers for all fields. On the Parameters tab page, the individual parameters are displayed only if they are the same for the main number and all sub-numbers. If they are not all the same (for example, the main asset and sub-numbers have different useful lives), then the field is shown with an asterisk (*).</p>
<p>The Transactions subscreen shows all transactions for all the sub-numbers. The display of planned/posted depreciation per period shows the total of all sub-numbers for each period. When you jump to other Asset Accounting reports, these are started without being limited to a sub-number. The report then displays all sub-numbers.</p>
<h2>Limitations of using an asterisk (*) for the sub-number</h2> 
<p><b>Display of the depreciation trace (RATRACE0N)</b> &minus; The trace always relates to a specific asset and it is not possible to add assets together. The report is started for the asset that has the lowest sub-number.</p>
<p><b>Display of asset master record (AS03)</b> &minus; It is started for the first existing asset.</p>
<h1>SAP FI - Cash Management</h1>
<p>The Cash Management field in SAP FI is used to manage cash flows and to ensure that you have sufficient liquidity to cover your payment obligations.</p>

<h1>SAP CO - Profit Center</h1>
<p>SAP CO Profit Center is used for managing internal controlling. When you divide your company into profit centers, it allows you to delegate responsibility to decentralized units and treat them as separate companies in a company. It also allows you to calculate key figures in cost accounting like ROI, Cash flow, etc.</p>
<p>Profit Center is a part of Enterprise Controlling module and is integrated with a new General Ledger Accounting.</p>
<h2>Key Features of SAP CO Profit Center</h2> 
<p>Profit Center Accounting is used to determine profit for internal areas of responsibility. It lets you determine profits and losses using either period accounting or the cost-of-sales approach.</p>
<p>It allows you to analyze fixed assets by profit center, thus using them as investment centers. It allows to expand profit centers to investment centers.</p>
<h2>Why Do We Create Profit Center?</h2>
<p>The main aim of creating a Profit Center in SAP CO is to analyze the cost of a product line or a business unit.</p>
<p>You can also generate P&amp;L accounts according to a Profit Center and also generate balance sheets, however a Profit Center should only be used for internal reporting purpose.</p>
<p>The key components of a profit center include – name of the profit center, the controlling area under which it is assigned, time period, person responsible for the profit center, standard hierarchy, etc.</p>

<h1>SAP CO - Product Costing</h1>
<p>SAP CO Product Costing module is used to find the value of internal cost of products. It is also used for profitability and management accounting for production.</p>
<p>While configuring Product Costing, it involves two areas for setting &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Product Cost Planning</li>
<li>Cost Object Controlling</li>
</ul>
<p>The basics of Product Costing is Cost Center Planning. The goal of cost center planning is to plan total dollars and quantities in each Cost Center in a Plant.</p>
<h2>Product Costing &minus; Overview</h2> 
<p>Use the <b>T-code</b> KP06 and enter the controlling area.</p>
<p>Cost Center dollars are planned by activity Type and cost element. You can also enter the variable and fixed dollar amounts.</p>
<p>You can plan all costs in production cost centers where they will end up through allocations, or you can plan costs where they are incurred and use plan assessments and distributions to allocate.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_fico/images/product_costing.jpg" alt="Product Costing" />
<p>To define cost center activity quantities, use the <b>T-code</b> KP26. You can also manually enter an activity rate based on last year's actual values. Note that if you enter an activity rate instead of using the system to calculate a rate, you lose the opportunity to review actual vs. plan and see dollar and unit variances. It is a best practice to plan activity quantities based on practical installed capacity which accounts for downtime. If you plan at full capacity, plan activity rates will be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's say we are using Product Costing to value our inventory in a cookie baking shop. This will help us value our cookies (finished good), frosting (semi-finished good), and baking items like eggs, milk, and sugar (raw materials). In order to calculate costs, we need to come up with rates for each activity, such as mixing baking items, oven baking, and cookie cooling. Since a rate is a dollar per unit, we can either come up with a rate based on previous year's actual rates, or enter our total costs and total units.</p>
<h1>SAP CO - Profitability Analysis</h1>
<p>SAP CO Profitability Analysis is used to analyze the market segments classified as products, customers, sales area, business area, etc.</p>
<p>SAP CO Profitability Analysis (CO-PA) is used for the evaluation of Market segments which is classified according to products, customers, and orders &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>or any combination of these.</li>
<li>or Strategic business units such as sales organizations.</li>
<li>or business areas, with reference to company's profit.</li>
<li>or contribution margin.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of Profitability Analysis are supported &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Costing-based Profitability Analysis</b> &minus; It is used to group the costs and revenues as per the value fields. It is used to ensure that you access at all times to a complete, short-term profitability report.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Account-based Profitability Analysis</b> &minus; It is used to provide you with a profitability report that is permanently reconciled with financial accounting. It is mainly used for getting information related to sales, marketing, product management and corporate planning departments to support internal accounting and decision-making.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Components in SAP CO-PA</h2> 
<p>The key components in SAP CO-PA are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Actual Posting</b> &minus; It allows you to transfer sales orders and billing documents from the Sales and Distribution application component to CO-PA in real time. You can also transfer costs from cost centers, orders and projects, as well as costs and revenues from direct postings or settle costs from CO to profitability segment.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Information System</b> &minus; It allows you to analyze existing data from a profitability standpoint using drilldown function in the reporting tool. It allows you to navigate through a multidimensional data cube using different functions like drilldown or switching hierarchies. The system displays data in either value fields or accounts, depending on the currently active type of Profitability Analysis and the type to which the report structure is assigned.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Planning</b> &minus; This allows you to create a sales and profit plan. Whereas both types of Profitability Analysis can receive actual data in parallel, there is no common source of planning data. Consequently, you always plan either in accounts (account-based CO-PA) or in value fields (costing-based CO-PA). The manual planning function allows you to define planning screens for your organization. With this you can display reference data in planning, calculate formulas, create forecasts, and more. You can perform planning at any level of detail.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>You can plan at a higher level, and have this data distributed top-down automatically. In automatic planning, you can copy and revaluate actual or planning data for a large number of profitability segments at once.</p>
<h1>SAP CO - Planning Methods</h1>
<p>SAP CO Planning Method allows you to plan the profitability segments as mentioned in the Planning packages.</p>
<p>To execute a planning method, you need to define it in a parameter set. Each planning method is executed via parameter set. To create a parameter set, you need to first define the Planning level. For parameter set to execute, there should be at least one planning package exists at that level.</p>
<p>There are two different types of planning methods and they differ in the way they allow you to enter and edit planning data for the profitability segments.</p>
<h2>Manual Type</h2>
<p>Manual planning methods allows you to enter planning data and display planning data in the profitability segments specified in the planning package are listed individually for editing or display.</p>
<p>In parameter set, you mention how the profitability segments are to be listed. When planning method is executed, processing of parameter set occurs and you can directly check the results of your processing.</p>
<h2>Automatic Type</h2> 
<p>With automatic planning methods like copy, top-down distribution and delete, all profitability segments that are specified in the planning package are processed.</p>
<p>You need to mention in the parameter set like- how these segments are to be processed, when you execute the method, the system automatically processes the segments without any need of manual action.</p>
<p>Results of the processing can be checked using a report in the information system or by manual planning method display planning data.</p>
<h1>SAP FI - Integration</h1>
<p>SAP FI is commonly integrated with MM and SD component. SAP FI Integration with other modules means how the system maps with different modules and how the effect of those is passed into FI Module.</p>
<h2>FI Integration with SD and MM</h2> 
<p>For SAP FI-MM, use the <b>T-code</b> OBYC</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_fico/images/fi_integration.jpg" alt="FI Integration" />
<p>Whenever there is a delivery created with reference to a sales order, goods movement takes place in the system.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In case of standard sales order, you create an outbound goods delivery to the customer. Here movement 601 takes place. This movement is configured in MM and movement of goods hit some G/L account in FI.</p>
<p>Every such movement of goods hits General Ledger account in FI.</p>
<p>The accounts posting in FI is done with reference to the billing documents like credit and debit note, invoice etc. created in SD and hence this is link between SD and FI.</p>
<p>Tax determination: In case of a tax determination, there is a direct link between SD and MM.</p>
<h2>Movement Types</h2>
<p>Material movements in MM is done with respect to a Movement Type.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Goods receipt – movement type 101</li>
<li>Goods issue to production order – movement type 261</li>
<li>Scrapping of goods – movement type 551</li>
<li>Goods delivered to the customer – movement type 601</li>
<li>Initial upload of stock – movement type 561</li>
</ul>
<p>SAP allows us to use different G/L accounts for the various movements for the same material by linking this movement type to a transaction key and hence we can set G/L accounts as per movement type.</p>
