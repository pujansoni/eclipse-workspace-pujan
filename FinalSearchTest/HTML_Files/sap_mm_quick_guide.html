<h1>SAP MM - Procurement Process</h1>

<p>Every organization acquires material or services to complete its business needs. The process of buying materials and obtaining services from vendors or dealers is procurement.  Procurement process should be done in such a way that it is ordered in correct quantity, with a proper value at the proper time. It is subdivided into following parts:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Basic Procurement</p></li>
<li><p>Special Procurement</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Procurement</h2>
<p>It is a process of acquiring goods or services in the right amount, at the right price at the right time. So the method of getting services, supplies, and equipment from a vendor (seller), at the right price at the right time in right amount is termed as Procurement. The quality of procurement is attempting to “get the right balance”, consider the following example:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Organizations try and keep inventory levels at a minimum due to the prices associated with high levels of inventory; however at identical time it is very expensive to prevent production due to shortages in raw materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting the minimum price for a product or service is often necessary, however the balance between product availability, quality, and vendor (seller) relations is also necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Procurement Lifecycle</h2>
<p>Most modern organizations procurement follow some sequential steps which are described below:</p>
<h3>Requirement and Information Gathering</h3>
<p>Procurement process starts with gathering information about product and its quantity.    Then for required products and services, it is necessary to look for suppliers who can satisfy the requirements.</p>
<h3>Supplier Contact</h3>
<p>After gathering requirements one will look for the suppliers who can fulfill the requirements. Based on that quotation request or information request can be made to suppliers or direct contact can be made with them.</p>
<h3>Background Review</h3>
<p>Once the supplier is known product/service quality is checked, and any necessities for services such as installation, warranty and its maintenance are investigated. Some samples of the products can be obtained for quality examination.</p>
<h3>Negotiation</h3>
<p>Some negotiations with suppliers is made regarding price, availability and delivery schedule of the products/services. After this a contract is signed that is a binding legal document between supplier and ordering party. A contract will include all necessary information like price and quantity of material, delivery date, etc.</p>
<h3>Order fulfillment</h3>
<p>Ordered material will be shipped, delivered to the ordering party and supplier is paid accordingly. Training and Installation of product or services may also be included.</p>
<h3>Consumption, Maintenance and Disposal</h3>
<p>As the products/service is consumed the performance of the products or services is evaluated and any follow up service support if required is analyzed. </p>
<h3>Contract Renewal</h3>
<p>Once the product or services are consumed or contract expires and needs to be renewed, or the product or service is to be re-ordered, company experience with vendors and service provider is reviewed. If the products or services are to be re-ordered, the company decides whether to order from previous supplier or think about new suppliers.</p>
<h2>Basic Procurement Activities</h2>
<p>Basic Procurement activities flow is given in the following image:</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/basic_procurement.png" alt="SAP Basic Procurement" />
<p>A brief introduction of Procurement activities is given below:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th style="width:145px">Procurement Activities</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Determination of requirement</td><td>It is the logical subdivision where it is determined that what material or services are required to company, and which supplier can fulfill the requirement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Creating Purchase Requisition</td><td>It is the phase in which purchasing department is informed about the requirement of items or services required for business purpose. A requisition is a internal document.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Creating Purchase Order</td><td>It is the phase when order is created from requisition and it is approved and assigned to a supplier. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Goods receipt/ Invoice Received</td><td>It is the phase in which the material is received by the company and the condition and quality are verified. In this phase Invoice is received from the vendor (seller).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Invoice verification/ Vendor Payment</td><td>It is the phase in which the vendor (seller) is paid from the company and reconciliation of the invoice and PO is accomplished.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Type of Basic Procurement</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of Basic procurement which are shown below:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Procurement for Stock vs Consumption</p></li>
<li><p>External vs Internal Procurement </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Procurement for Stock vs Consumption</h3>
<p>The following points show the difference of Procurement for Stock vs. Consumption:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Procurement for Stock -</b> A stock material is a material that is kept in stock. These materials are kept in stock once received from the vendor. The stock of this material keeps on increasing or decreasing based on amount of the quantity received or issued. To order a material for stock, the material <b>must</b> have a master record within the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Procurement for Direct Consumption -</b> When procurement is for direct consumption i.e. it will be consumed as soon as it is received, the user should specify the consumption purpose. To order a material for consumption, the material <b>may</b> have a master record within the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>External vs Internal Procurement</h3>
<p>The following points show the difference of External vs Internal Procurement:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>External procurement -</b> It is the process of procuring goods or services from external vendors. There are 3 basic forms of external procurement generally supported by the Purchasing component of IT system. </p> 
<p><b>One time orders</b> are generally used for material and services that are ordered irregularly.</p>
<p><b>Longer-term contracts with the subsequent issue of release orders</b> - For materials that are being ordered regularly and in large quantities, we can negotiate deal with the vendor (seller) for pricing or conditions & record then in a contract. In a contract you also specify the validity date.</p>
<p><b>Longer-term scheduling agreements and delivery schedules</b> - If a material is ordered on an everyday basis and is to be delivered according to an exact time schedule, then you set up a scheduling agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Internal Procurement -</b> Large corporate organizations may own multiple separate businesses or companies. Internal Procurement is process of getting material and services from among identical company. So, each of these companies maintains a complete bookkeeping system with separate Balance, Profit & Loss Statements so that when trade occurs between them it will be recorded.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Procurement</h2>
<p>Special stocks are stocks that are managed differently as these stocks did not belong to company and these are being kept at some particular location. 
Special procurement and special stocks types are divided into the subsequent areas.</p>
<h3>Consignment Stocks</h3>
<p>Material that is available at our store premises, however it still belongs to the vendor (seller)/Owner of the material. If you utilize the material from consignment stocks, then you have to pay to the vendor.</p>
<h3>Third-party processing</h3>
<p>In third-party processing, a company passes on a sales order to associate external vendor (seller) who sends the goods directly to the customer. The sales order is not processed by your company, however by the vendor (seller). Third-party items can be entered in purchase requisitions, purchase orders and sales orders.</p>
<h3>Pipeline handling</h3>
<p>In pipeline handling, the company needs not to order or store the material involved. It is obtainable as and when required via a pipeline (for example, oil or water), or another style of cable (such as electricity). The material that is consumed is settled with the vendor (seller) on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Returnable Transport Stock</h3>
<p>The company orders goods from a vendor (seller). The goods are delivered with returnable transport packaging (pallets, containers) that belongs to the vendor (seller) and is stored on the customer premises until they return it to the company.</p>
<h3>Subcontracting</h3>
<p>The vendor (the subcontractor) receives components from the ordering party with the help of which it produces a product. The product is ordered by your company through a purchase order. The components required by the vendor (seller) to manufacture the ordered product are listed in the purchase order and provided to the subcontractor.</p>
<h3>Stock transfer using stock transport order</h3>
<p>Goods are procured and supplied within a company. One plant order the goods internally from another plant (receiving plant/issuing plant).
The goods are procured with a special type of purchase order - the stock transport order. You'll be able to request and monitor the transfer of goods with a stock transport order.</p>
<h1>SAP MM - Organization Structure</h1>
<p>Organization structure is the framework of company according to which business is conducted in every company .Organization structure consists of many levels which have relationship to one or another. Organization structure is also referred as enterprise structure. Enterprise structure is made up of many organizational units having relationship with one another.</p>
<h2>SAP Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>When client purchases SAP it comes in a CD in form of software. When SAP is first installed, SAP has its standard set up that needs to be configured according to the need of client i.e. organization.</p>
<p>Configuration of SAP software like add fields, to change field names, to modify drop down lists etc. to adjust according to working of your organization is done through implementation guide known as IMG. IMG is where we define enterprise structure and other settings that are required for functioning of SAP software according to need of an organization.</p>
<h2>SAP IMG Path</h2>
<p>To do any type of configuration according to our organization need the first step is to reach the implementation (IMG) guide screen. We can reach implementation guide in 2 ways:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Menu path</p></li>
<li><p>Transactional code</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Menu path</h3>
<p>We can navigate through the following path to reach out to IMG: </p>
<p>SAP Easy Access => Tools => Customizing => IMG => Execute Project</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/execute_project.png" alt="SAP IMG Path" />
<h3>Transactional code</h3>
<p>Best and simple way to reach out any SAP screen is TCode i.e. transactional code. Transactional code to reach out IMG: SPRO (SAP Project Reference Object). Enter the Transaction code in command field and then click on enter.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/tcode.png" alt="SAP TCODE" />

<h1>SAP MM - Enterprise Structure</h1>
<p>Every organization has some framework or some structure is defined according to which the whole business runs. Enterprise structure is the structure that represents an enterprise in SAP ERP system. It is subdivided into various organizational units which for legal reason or business related reason are grouped together.</p>
<p>Enterprise structure defines various levels in an organization. These levels are placed according to some hierarchy. Each level has some specific functionality associated with it, which in a combined way describes the working of an organization. Also enterprise structure defines various organizational units that are present in an enterprise. The Organizational Structure in MM consists of following Organizational Levels:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Client</p></li>
<li><p>Company Code</p></li>
<li><p>Plant</p></li>
<li><p>Storage Location</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing Organization</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing Group</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following diagram is one such organizational structure which describes the levels incorporated in an organization. Client being at the topmost, followed by multiple company code, followed by multiple plants, plants having multiple storage location with their own or centralized purchasing organizations.</p>

Every level has some particular functionality associated with it. Also every level in one or other way is related to each other. These levels are placed according to some hierarchy company being at the top.</p>
<p>To establish relationship between these levels we have to assign them to one or other in such a way that they still lie in the same hierarchy. For Example: As Company is at top level and plant is below it, so it is necessary that plant has some relation with company (As plant is a sub part or smaller division of company), so plant will be assigned to company. Four basic and must assignments in standard SAP are:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Plant to Company code</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing organization to company code</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing organization to Plant</p></li>

<h1>SAP MM - Master Data</h1>
<p>SAP R/3 works on real time data that is there is no time lag between data entry and data availability. The important thing while creating any data is to maintain data integrity. SAP R/3 data is categorized into two:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Master data</b> - Data that is created centrally and it is valid for all applications. It remains constant over the time but we need to update it on regular basis. For Example: Vendor is a type of master data that is used for creating purchase orders or contracts.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Transactional data</b> - Data that is associated with processing of business transaction is Transactional data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SAP Master Data is of following two types:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Material Master Data</p></li>
<li><p>Vendor Master Data</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Material Master Data</h2>
<p>The key points about material master are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>This is the enterprise main source of material specific data. This data will include information on the materials that a company can procure, or produce, or store or sell. </p></li>
<li><p>Since there are different departments in an enterprise and each department works on some specific material. So they will enter different information regarding their material. So each user department has its own view of material master record. So, the data screens that are used to create material master can be divided into two categories:<br><b>Main Data</b>: This will include basic data (base unit of measure, weight), purchasing data (over tolerance and under tolerance), accounting data (standard price, moving price).<br><b>Additional Data</b>: This will include additional information like short description about material, currency etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Material master has the four characteristics which will be discussing one by one in below context.</p>
<h3>Material Types</h3>
<p>Materials with some common attributes are grouped together and they are assigned to a material type. This will differentiate materials and allow organization to manage different materials in systematic manner in accordance to company’s requirement. For example: Raw Material, Finished Products are some of the material types. Material type can be created by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to create material type:<br>IMG >= Logistics General >= Material Master >= Basic Settings >= Material Types >= Define Attributes of Material Types<br>TCode:  OMS2</p>
<p>On display IMG screen select Define Attributes of Material Types execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/material_types.png" alt="SAP Material Types" />
<p>Select New Entries icon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/material_types_new_entry.png" alt="SAP Material Types New Entry" />
<p>Fill in the required information like name of material type and description. Click on save. A new material type will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/material_types_entry_details.png" alt="SAP Material Types Entry Details " />
<h3>Material Groups</h3>
<p>Material group is a wider range of material type. Materials with some common attributes are taken together and they are assigned to material group. For Example: Suppose we have some materials which need packaging, so there material type can be electrical or food products but we can group these material types and put them in packaged material group. Material Group can be created by following below steps:</p>
<p>Path to Create Material Group:<br>IMG => Logistic General => Material Master => Settings for Key Fields => Define Material Groups<br>TCode: OMSF</p>
<p>On display IMG screen select Define Material Groups execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/material_groups.png" alt="SAP Material Groups" />
<p>Select New Entries Icon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/material_groups_new_entry.png" alt="SAP Material Groups New Entry" />
<p>Enter the name of material group along with its description. Click on Save. A new material group will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/material_groups_entry_details.png" alt="SAP Material Groups Entry details" />
<h3>Number Range</h3>
<p>When we create material master record every material is recognized by a number, that number will be unique and known as material number. We can assign number to material through two ways:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>External number assignment - While creating material you have to enter your own number (containing alphabets or digits), and that should be unique.</li>
<li><p>Internal number assignment - While creating material you need not enter any number, system will automatically generate a unique number to that material.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Define Number Range:</b></p>
<p>Internal number range can be defined by following the below steps:</p>
<p>Path to Create Number Range:<br>IMG => Logistic General => Material Master => Basic Settings => Material Types => Define Number Range for Each material Type<br>
TCode: MMNR</p>
<p>On display IMG screen select Define Number Range for Each material Type execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/define_number_range.png" alt="SAP define number range" />
<p>Select Intervals Icon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/number_range_interval.png" alt="SAP number range interval" />
<p>We can define number range here and EXT (external tab, if it is checked then external number assignment can be done in that material). Click on save.
Number Range is now defined for the material.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/number_range_define_interval.png" alt="SAP number range define interval" />
<p><b>Assignment of Number Range:</b></p>
<p>After defining we need to assign it to material group. Number range can be assigned by following the below steps.</p>
<p>In the same screen as shown above select Groups tab.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/assign_number_range.png" alt="SAP Assign number range" />
<p>For a particular material group we can assign number range here. Click on save. Number range is now assigned to material group.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/assign_number_range_entry.png" alt="SAP Assign number range entry" />
<h3>Material Master Creation</h3>
<p>Material master contains all materials that a company procures produces or sells. Material Master is a central data that is available at all the levels. Material can be created by following the below steps:</p>
<p>Path to create Material Master:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Material Master => Material => Create Material<br>TCode: MM01</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> For any create transaction we use 01, for edit 02, for display 03 as suffix.</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select create icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/create_material.png" alt="SAP create material" />

<h2>Vendor Master Data</h2>
<p>The key points about vendor master are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>This is the enterprise main source of vendor specific data. This data will include information on vendors from which a company can procure or it can sell.</p></li>
<li><p>Vendor Master Record will contain information like vendor's name, address.</p></li>
<li><p>Data in vendor master record is divided into three categories:<br><b>General Data</b>:General data is maintained at client level and it is valid for all organizational levels.<br><b>Accounting Data</b>:Accounting data is maintained at company level and it is valid for all plants belonging to that company.<br><b>Purchasing Data</b>:Purchasing data is maintained at purchasing organization level.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Vendor master has the three characteristics which will be discussing one by one in below context.</p>
<h3>Vendor Account Group</h3>
<p>Vendors are categorized according to requirements and some of the vendors having similar characteristics are grouped together and placed in one category. For Example: All local vendors can be placed under one account group. Vendor Account group can be created by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to create Vendor Account Group:<br>IMG => Logistic General => Business Partner => Vendors => Control => Define Account group and field selection(vendor) <br>TCode: OBD3</p>

<h1>SAP MM - Purchase Info Record</h1>
<p>SAP R/3 works on all real time data that include material master and vendor master. Material and vendor master are separate data records for keeping information of materials and vendors from which material is procured. The combined information of material and vendor altogether is kept in a record that we call as purchase info record. The key points about purchase info record are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Purchasing info record stores information on material and vendor supplying that material. For Example: Vendors current price of a particular material is stored in info record.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase info record can be maintained at plant level or at purchasing organization level.</p></li>
<li><p>Info record can be maintained for four procurement types which are as follows:<br><b>Standard</b>: Standard info record has information on standard orders (orders include details of vendor and material). This info record will include vendors price for supplying the particular material.<br><b>Subcontracting</b>: Subcontracting info record has information on subcontract orders. This info record will include price for assembling the raw material that is supplied by the ordering party.<br><b>Pipeline</b>: Pipeline info record has information on material that is provided by vendor through pipes. For Example: like water,electricity.<br><b>Consignment</b>: Consignment info record has information on material that is kept at ordering party premises. This info record contains vendors price that is to be paid for withdrawing material from consignment stock.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creation of Purchase Info Record</h2>

<h1>AP MM - Source Determination/List</h1>
<p>The combined information of material and vendor altogether is kept in a record that is known as purchase info record. But a particular material can be ordered from different vendors in different time intervals. This information can be maintained in a list that is called as source list. The key points about source list are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Source list include list of possible sources of supply for a material over a given framework of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Source list specifies the time period of ordering of a particular material from a given vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>Source list can be copied from one plant to another plant.</p></li>

<h1>SAP MM - Procurement Cycle</h1>
<p>Every organization acquires material or services to complete its business needs. The process of buying materials and obtaining services from vendors or dealers is procurement. The steps which are required to procure a material forms the procurement cycle. Every organization performs some common sequential steps so that a material can be procured in right quantity at the right price. The important steps in procurement cycle are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Determination of Requirement</p></li>
<li><p>Creating Purchase Order</p></li>
<li><p>Posting Goods Receipt</p></li>
<li><p>Posting Invoice</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Determination of Requirement</h2>
<p>This is the first step in procurement cycle. It is the logical subdivision where it is determined that what material or services are required by company, and which supplier can fulfill the requirement. A list of requirements is made and then it is approved by senior authority within the organization. After approval, formal list is made that is known as purchase order with one more level of approval which is sent to the vendor.</p>
<h2>Creating Purchase Order</h2>
<p>Purchase order is the formal and final confirmation of the requirements which is sent to vendor to supply material or services. Purchase order will include important information like name of material with its corresponding plant, details of purchasing organization with its company code, name of vendor,and date for delivery of material. Purchase order can be created by following the below steps:</p>
<p>Path to create Purchase Order:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Purchasing => Purchase Order => Create => Vendor/ Supplying Plant Known<br>TCode: ME21N</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Create Vendor/Supplying Plant Known execute icon by following the above path.</p>

<p>Fill in all necessary details under Item by selecting the tabs like Invoice/Delivery Tab (Provide the tax code, Payment terms and conditions, and incoterms), Assignment Tab (Provide the valid G/L code, business area, and WBS element. Click on save. A new Purchase Order will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/purchase_order_item.png" alt="SAP Purchase Order Item tab" />
<h2>Posting Goods Receipt</h2>
<p>After processing of purchase order by vendor, material is delivered to ordering party and this process is called as goods receipt. So, goods receipt is the phase in which the material is received by the ordering party and the condition and quality are verified. Once material is verified against quality then goods receipt is posted. Goods receipt can be posted by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to post Goods Receipt:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Inventory management => Goods movement => Goods movement<br>TCode: MIGO</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Goods movement (MIGO) execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/goods_receipt.png" alt="SAP goods receipt" />

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/invoice_posting_detail.png" alt="SAP invoice posting detail" />
<h1>SAP MM - Purchase Requisition</h1>
<p>Procurement in every organization starts with gathering requirements. Once requirements are gathered we need to inform the purchasing organization. Purchase Requisition is a document that will contain list of requirements. The key points about purchase requisition are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Purchase requisition is a request that is made to purchasing organization to procure certain list of material.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase requisition is an internal document; specifically it remains within the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase requisition needs approval from purchasing organization.</p></li>
<li><p>If purchase requisition is approved then changes are possible only to limited extent.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase requisition can be created for the following procurement types:<br><b>Standard</b>: Getting finished material from vendor.<br><b>Subcontracting</b>: Providing raw material to vendor and getting finished material.<br><b>Consignment</b>: Procuring material that is kept in company’s premises and paying to vendor for that.<br><b>Stock transfer</b>: Getting material from within the organization.<br><b>External service</b>: Getting services like maintenance from third party vendor.</p></li>
</ul>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/po_pr_detail.png" alt="SAP PO from PR detail" />
<h1>SAP MM - Request for Quotation</h1>
<p>Vendor selection is an important process in procurement cycle. Once requirements are gathered we will look for possible suppliers who can fulfill the requirements at the best possible price. So a request is made to vendors to submit their quotations indicating the price of material along with their terms and conditions. This request is known as request for quotation. The key points about request for quotation are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Request for quotation is a form of invitation that is sent to vendors to submit quotation indicating pricing and their terms and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>RFQ contains details about goods or services, quantity, date of delivery and date of bid on which it is to be submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Quotation is a reply by a vendor in response to request for quotation. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>RFQ can be created by following two ways:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Manually</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically from Purchase Requisition</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Manual Creation of RFQ</h2>

<h1>SAP MM - Outline Agreement</h1>
<p>Vendor selection is an important process in procurement cycle. Vendors can be selected by quotation process. Once vendors are short-listed by organization, it enters into agreement with a certain vendor to supply certain items with certain conditions and typically when agreement is reached a formal contract is signed with the vendor. So, outline agreement is a long term purchasing agreement with vendor. The key points about outline agreement are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Outline agreement is a long term purchasing agreement with vendor containing terms and conditions regarding the material that is supplied by vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>Outline agreement are valid up to certain period of time and cover a certain predefined quantity or value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Outline agreement is of following two types.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Contract</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduling Agreement</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Contract</h2>
<p>Contract is a long term outline agreement between vendor and ordering party over predefined material or services over certain framework of time. There are two types of contract:<br><b>Quantity Contract</b>: In this type of contract overall value is specified in terms of total quantity of material to be supplied by vendor.<br><b>Value Contract</b>: In this type of contract overall value is specified in terms of total amount to be paid for that material to the vendor.</p>

<h1>SAP MM - Quota Arrangement</h1>
<p>A particular material can be procured from different vendors depending upon the requirement. So, total requirement of a material is distributed to different vendor’s i.e. quota is assigned to each source of supply. This is known as quota arrangement. The key points about quota arrangement are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Quota arrangement divides the total requirement of material among certain sources of supply i.e. vendors and then assigns quota to each source.</p></li>
<li><p>This particular quota specifies the portion of material that is to be procured from assigned vendor or source.</p></li>
<li><p>Quota rating is used to determine the amount of material that is to be assigned to particular source or vendor. The source with lowest quota rating represents the valid source.</p></li>
<li><p>Quota rating can be calculated by following formula:<br>Quota rating = (Quota Allocated Quantity + Quota Base Quantity)/Quota<br>Where Quota Allocated Quantity is total quantity from all orders that is procured from a particular source. Quota Base Quantity is quantity from new source of supply. Quota is total requirement of material that is given to a particular source of supply.</p></li>
<li><p>The mandatory setting before creating quota is info record and source list should be maintained for the particular material. Also in material master, source list and quota arrangement usage check box should be checked. This setting can be made in material master by going to TCode MM03. In purchasing view check the quota arrangement usage and source list. Setting is now maintained for quota arrangement.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>SAP MM - Posting Period</h1>
<p>SAP ERP systems were designed so that business can be conducted in an efficient way. Various documents like purchase order, request for quotation, goods receipt are essential documents in a business. These documents need security i.e. if any of documents is posted incorrectly then business can be affected at various concern levels. So, to secure these documents we have a concept of posting period. Posting period means it will allow you to post and make changes in the documents only in a specific time period. Sometimes you will get error like posting allowed only in this time period for a certain company code. This means for a particular company code posting period is maintained and posting to that document is only allowed within that period. Posting period for a company can be defined using five fields which are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Maintain Fiscal Year Variant</p></li>
<li><p>Assign Fiscal Year Variant to Company Code</p></li>
<li><p>Define Variants for Open Posting Periods</p></li>

<h1>SAP MM - Purchase Order Types</h1>
<p>SAP ERP was introduced so that procurement can be done efficiently in terms of time and cost. Procurement can be done for various types of goods and services. Procurement starts with creating purchase order that is a formal document given to vendors and it include list of goods and materials that are to be procured. So, accordingly purchase order can be created for different types of procurement. The type of procurement can be maintained in a field that is known as item category as shown below.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/purchase_item_category.png" alt="SAP purchase item category" />
<p>For different procurement types, there are four types of purchase order which are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Subcontracting Purchase Order</p></li>
<li><p>Consignment Purchase Order</p></li>
<li><p>Stock Transfer Purchase Order</p></li>
<li><p>Service Purchase Order</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Subcontracting Purchase Order</h2>
<p>In subcontracting the vendor (the subcontractor) receives components from the ordering party with the help of which it produces a product. The product is ordered by your company through a purchase order. The components required by the vendor (seller) to manufacture the ordered product are listed in the purchase order and provided to the subcontractor. Subcontracting purchase order can be created by following the below step.</p>
<p>TCode to create Purchase Order: ME21N<br>Subcontracting Item Category: L</p>
<p>Provide the TCode in command field. It will take you to purchase order screen. Provide all necessary details like name of vendor, item category, name of material, plant for which material is procured and date of delivery. Click on save. Subcontracting Purchase order will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/purchase_subcontracting.png" alt="SAP purchase subcontracting" />
<h2>Consignment Purchase Order</h2>
<p>In consignment material is available at organization store premises, however it still belongs to the vendor (seller)/Owner of the material. If you utilize the material from consignment stocks, then you have to pay to the vendor. So, consignment purchase order can be created by following the below step.</p>
<p>TCode to create Purchase Order: ME21N<br>Consignment Item Category: K</p>
<p>Provide the TCode in command field. It will take you to purchase order screen. Provide all necessary details like name of vendor, item category, name of material, plant for which material is procured and date of delivery. Click on save. Consignment Purchase order will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/purchase_consignment.png" alt="SAP purchase consignment" />
<h2>Stock Transfer Purchase Order</h2>
<p>In stock transfer goods are procured and supplied within a company. One plant order the goods internally from another plant (receiving plant/issuing plant). The goods are procured with a special type of purchase order - the stock transport order.So, stock transfer purchase order can be created by following the below step.</p>
<p>TCode to create Purchase Order: ME21N<br>Stock Transfer Item Category: U</p>
<p>Provide the TCode in command field. It will take you to purchase order screen. Provide all necessary details like name of vendor, item category, name of material, plant for which material is procured and date of delivery. Click on save. Stock Transfer Purchase order will be created.</p>

<h1>SAP MM - Inventory Management</h1>
<p>Procurement process starts with gathering requirements and ends with procuring goods from vendors. Once goods are procured from vendor they need to be placed in company’s premises in correct place so that they can be consumed when required. This introduces the term known as inventory management. Inventory management deals with placing and handling stock received from vendors in correct place within company’s premises. The key points about inventory management are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Inventory management deals with management of stock either on value or quantity basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Planning, entry and keeping records of all goods movement comes under inventory management.</p></li>
<li><p>Goods movement will create a document that will update all stock quantity and value in inventory that is known as material document.</p></li>
<li><p>Material document will be referred by a document number and document year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inventory management deal with the following terms which are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Movement Type</p></li>
<li><p>Goods Receipt</p></li>
<li><p>Reservation</p></li>
<li><p>Goods Issue</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Movement Type</h2>
<p>Movement type describes the type of stock posting in inventory. It represents the posting in stock is due to which type of order like whether stock is posted against goods receipt or goods issue. The important movement types in sap mm are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>101 - Goods receipt for purchase order or order</p></li>
<li><p>103 - Goods receipt for purchase order into GR blocked stock</p></li>
<li><p>201 - Goods issue for a cost centre</p></li>
<li><p>261 - Goods issue for an order</p></li>
<li><p>301 - Transfer posting plant to plant in one step</p></li>
<li><p>305 - Transfer posting plant to plant in two steps - placement in storage</p></li>
<li><p>311 - Transfer posting storage location to storage location in one step</p></li>
<li><p>313 - Stock transfer storage locations to storage location in two steps - removal from storage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Movement types can be reached out by following the below steps:</p>
<p>Path to reach Movement Type:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Inventory Management => Goods Movement => Goods Movement (MIGO) <br>TCode: MIGO</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Goods Movement (MIGO) execute icon by following the above path.</p>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/im_movement_types.png" alt="SAP IM movement type" />
<h2>Goods Receipt</h2>
<p>Goods receipt is the phase in which the material is received by the ordering party and the condition and quality are verified. Depending upon the movement type stock is posted in inventory with the help of goods receipt. Goods receipt will show increase in warehouse stock. Goods receipt has two scenarios which are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Creation of Goods Receipt</p></li>
<li><p>Cancellation of Goods Receipt</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Creation of Goods Receipt</h3>

<h1>SAP MM - Invoice Verification</h1>
<p>Every organization acquires goods or services to complete its business needs. Once goods are procured from vendor and placed in company’s premises through goods receipt then we need to pay to vendor for acquired goods and services. The amount to be paid along with details of material is provided by vendor in form of document that is known as invoice.  Before paying to vendor we need to verify the invoice. This process of verifying invoice and paying to vendor is known as invoice verification. The key points about invoice verification are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Invoice verification marks the end of procurement after purchase order and goods receipt.</p></li>
<li><p>Invoice posting will update all related documents in financial and accounting.</p></li>
<li><p>Blocked invoice that vary from actual invoice can be processed through invoice verification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Invoice verification deals with the following terms which are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Posting of Invoice </p></li>
<li><p>Blocked Invoice</p></li> 
<li><p>Evaluated Receipt Settlement(ERS)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Posting of Invoice</h2>
<p>Posting of invoice is done after goods are received from vendor and goods receipt is done. Invoice received from vendor is verified against cost, quantity and quality by ordering party and then invoice is posted against that purchase order. So, this is the phase in which the vendor (seller) is paid from the company and reconciliation of the invoice and PO is accomplished. Invoice can be posted by following the below steps.</p> 
<p>Path to post Invoice:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Logistic Invoice Verification => Document Entry => Enter Invoice<br>TCode: MIRO</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Enter Invoice execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/post_invoice.png" alt="SAP post invoice" />
<p>Fill in all necessary details like invoice posting date, amount that is paid to vendor along with quantity for which amount is paid. Click on save. Invoice is now posted for the goods receipt.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/post_invoice_entry.png" alt="SAP post invoice entry" />
<h2>Blocked Invoice</h2>
<p>Sometimes accounting department is unable to pay the invoice to vendor. This may happen when you try to post an invoice, system expect certain default value against purchase order or goods receipt and posted invoice differs from default value. This may lead to invoice blocking. Some of the reasons for invoice blocking are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Variance in amount at item level</p></li>
<li><p>Variance in quantity at item level</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also difficult to analyse the small variances in invoice. So, tolerance limits are set up in the system and if variance in invoice is within the tolerance limit then system accepts the invoice. If variance limit is exceeded then it may lead to blocking of invoice. Then we need to manually unblock or release that invoice if we want to process the invoice. Invoice can be unblocked by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Release Blocked Invoice:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Logistic Invoice verification => Further Processing => Release Blocked Invoice<br>TCode: MRBR</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Release Blocked Invoices execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/release_block.png" alt="SAP release block invoice" />
<p>Provide the necessary details like company code, invoice document number, vendor, posting date, purchasing group. Then select execute icon. Blocked invoice will be released.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/release_block_entry.png" alt="SAP release block invoice entry" />
<h2>Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS)</h2>
<p>Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS) is an easy method of settling goods receipt automatically. If ordering party has agreed with vendor on all financial terms and condition, then ordering party need not verify the invoice. Invoice will be posted automatically from the information present in purchase order and goods receipt. The various advantages of ERS are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Purchase orders can be settled and closed quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>It reduces human efforts as no need to verify the invoice.</p></li>
<li><p>Amount and quantity variances in invoice can be avoided with the help of ERS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To implement ERS some mandatory setting needs to be done in vendor master which is described in below context.</p>
<p>Go to XK02 (Change mode of vendor master). Select Control data tab. Check the AutoEvalGRSetmt Del. and AutoEvalGRSetmt Ret box. Click on save. Now the particular vendor is enabled for ERS.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/setting_ers.png" alt="SAP Setting for ERS" />
<p>ERS can be created by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to create ERS:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Logistic Invoice verification => Automatic Settlement => Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS) <br>TCode: MRRL</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS) execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/ers_path.png" alt="SAP ERS path" />
<p>Fill in all necessary details like company code, plant, goods receipt document number and date, vendor, purchasing document. Click on save. ERS will be created for the corresponding purchase order and goods receipt.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/ers_entry.png" alt="SAP ERS entry" />
<h1>SAP MM - Service Management</h1>
<p>Every organization acquires goods to complete its business needs. Besides these goods procurement, an organization may require occasionally some kind of services. These services will include small maintenance task like changing the lights, painting and housekeeping. These services are carried out by external contractors and hence the whole process of procurement of services is known as service management. The key points about service management are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Services are meant for direct consumption instead of keeping them in inventory.</p></li>
<li><p>Service description along with unit of measure is stored as master data in a record that is known as service master record.</p></li>
<li><p>System stores the services that have been procured as a record in a sheet called as service entry sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Service procurement is of following two types:<br><b>Planned Services</b> - In planned services at the time of procurement specifications like quantity and price are known in advance. It means nature and scope of service is clear before procurement. <br><b>Unplanned Services</b> - In unplanned services at the time of procurement specifications like quantity and price are not known in advance. It means nature and scope of service is not clear before procurement. These services can be extended as per the requirement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Service management deals with the following terms which are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Service Master Record</p></li>
<li><p>Service Purchase Order</p></li>
<li><p>Service Entry Sheet</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Service Master Record</h2>
<p>Service master record contains the detail of all the services that can be procured from external vendor within an organization. Service master record contains description of services along with the unit of measure. This master record serves as a reference for creating service purchase order but it is not necessary, service purchase order can also be created manually without reference. Service master record can be created by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Create Service Master Record:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Service Master => Service => Service Master<br>TCode: AC03</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Service Master execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/service_mast_path.png" alt="SAP Service master path" />
<p>Select Create New Service icon as shown below.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/service_new_entry.png" alt="SAP Service master new entry" />
<p>Fill in all necessary details like service category, base unit of measure, valuation class. Click on save. A new Service will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/service_new_details.png" alt="SAP Service master details" />
<h2>Service Purchase Order</h2>
<p>In SAP MM services are accomplished with the help of service purchase order. The requirement of service with its description along with quantity is given to third party in form of service purchase order. In service purchase order important field is item category. For service, item category will be D. So, service purchase order can be created by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to create Purchase Order:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Purchasing => Purchase Order => Create => Vendor/ Supplying Plant Known<br>TCode: ME21N<br>Service Item Category: D</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Vendor/ Supplying Plant Known execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/service_po.png" alt="SAP Service PO" />
<p>Provide all necessary details like name of vendor, item category, name of material, plant for which material is procured and date of delivery. Click on save. Service Purchase order will be created.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/service_po_detail.png" alt="SAP Service PO detail" />
<h2>Service Entry Sheet</h2>
<p>System stores the services that have been procured as a record in a sheet called as service entry sheet. In case of services instead of creating goods receipt document we will create service entry sheet. Service entry sheet will accommodate the charges that we need to pay to the vendor. Service entry sheet can be created by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to create Service Entry Sheet:<br>Logistics => Materials Management => Service Entry Sheet => Maintain<br>TCode: ML81N</p>
<p>On SAP Menu screen select Maintain execute icon by following the above path.</p>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/service_sheet_detail.png" alt="SAP Service sheet detail" />
<h1>SAP MM - Valuation</h1>
<p>Procurement process starts with creating purchase order and ends with invoice verification. In the whole process one of the important parts is material valuation. In procurement process while creating purchase orders material price is a mandatory field and it is automatically determined. This happens because material valuation is maintained in SAP system in material master. Material valuation represents integration between MM & FI (Financial Accounting) modules since it updates the general ledger accounts in financial accounting. The key points about material valuation are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Material valuation helps to determine the price of material and for which general ledger account it needs to be posted in financial accounting.</p></li>
<li><p>Material valuation can happen at company code level or plant level.</p></li>
<li><p>Material can be valuated based on different types of procurement and this is known as split valuation. Normally split valuation is used to valuate material in same valuation area (company or plant) differently. Split valuation is described in detail in below context.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Split Valuation</h2>
<p>Split valuation enables you to valuate stocks of a material in the same valuation area (company or plant) differently. Some of the examples where split valuation is required are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Stock that is procured externally from vendor has a different valuation price than the stock of in-house production.</p></li>
<li><p>Stock obtained from one vendor is valuated at a different price than stock obtained from another vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>Same material having different batch may have different valuation prices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Split Valuation needs to be activated before setting any other configuration. Split valuation can be activated by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Activate Split Valuation:<br>IMG => Materials Management => Valuation and Account Assignment => Split Valuation => Activate Split Valuation<br>TCode: OMW0</p>
<p>On Display IMG screen select Activate Split Valuation execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/split_valuation.png" alt="SAP Split Valuation" />
<p>Select Split material valuation active tab. Click on save. Split valuation is now activated.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/split_valuation_set.png" alt="SAP Split Valuation Set" />
<p>Some important terms under split valuation are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Valuation Area:</b> Material may be valuated at plant level or at company code level. The level at which materials are valuated is known as valuation area.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Valuation Category: </b>Valuation category is the criteria on which material is split valuated.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Valuation Type: </b>Valuation type specifies the features of a valuation category.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Split valuation configurations like defining valuation category, valuation type are described in below context.</p>
<h2>Split Valuation Configuration</h2>
<p>Split valuation configurations like defining valuation category, valuation type can be done by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Configure Split Valuation:<br>IMG => Materials Management => Valuation and Account Assignment => Split Valuation => Configure Split Valuation<br>

<h1>SAP MM - Account Determination</h1>
<p>In SAP MM, procurement process involves cost of goods and services that needs to be paid to vendor by an organization. The cost being paid must be posted in an organization necessarily in a correct general ledger (G/L) account. Every time during procurement to remember the correct G/L account is an impossible thing. So, in SAP system some configuration for account determination is done so that system will automatically determine the correct G/L account that needs to be posted. G/L account is posted when goods receipt is done as well as during clearing invoice verification. Account determination deals with the following terms which are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Define Valuation Control</p></li>
<li><p>Group together Valuation Areas</p></li>
<li><p>Define Valuation Classes</p></li>
<li><p>Configure Automatic Posting</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Define Valuation Control</h2>
<p>Valuation areas can be grouped together and can be assigned to one grouping code if they belong to same G/L account. For example different plants under one company code can be assigned same valuation grouping code and vice versa. Before this, valuation grouping code must be activated and this can be done by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Activate Valuation Grouping Code:<br>IMG => Materials Management => Valuation and Account Assignment => Account Determination => Account Determination without Wizard => Define Valuation Control<br>TCode: OMWM</p>
<p>On Display IMG screen select Define Valuation Control execute icon by following the above path.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/ad_activate_grouping.png" alt="SAP Activate Grouping code" />
<p>Select Valuation grouping code active tab. Click on save. Valuation grouping code is now activated.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_mm/images/ad_activated.png" alt="SAP Activate Grouping code" />
<h2>Group together Valuation Areas</h2>
<p>In valuation grouping, valuation area and valuation grouping code are assigned to company code. This can be done by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Define Valuation Area and Valuation Grouping Code:<br>IMG => Materials Management => Valuation and Account Assignment => Account Determination => Account Determination without Wizard => Group Together Valuation Areas<br>TCode: OMWD</p>

<h2>Define Valuation Classes</h2>
<p>Valuation class categorizes the G/L account on the basis of material type. For example raw material will have different G/L account than the finished material as the cost will be different in both the cases. Account reference is also maintained along with valuation class. Account reference and valuation class can be defined by following the below steps.</p>
<p>Path to Define Account Reference and Valuation Class:<br>IMG => Materials Management => Valuation and Account Assignment => Account Determination => Account Determination without Wizard => Define Valuation Classes<br>TCode: OMSK</p>
