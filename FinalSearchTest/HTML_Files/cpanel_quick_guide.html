<h1>cPanel - Overview</h1>
<p>cPanel is a Linux-based hosting management control panel. It is used to manage your website and server’s backend working system. It provides graphical user interface for most of the tasks we perform on the website’s server, for example, uploading files, creating emails, setting cron jobs, handling databases, etc.</p>
<h2>cPanel Users</h2>
<p>cPanel is installed on a Linux system by the server administrator. With the help of the cPanel Software Server, an Administrator can create Virtual Private Servers or it can dedicate the whole server for shared hosting environment. cPanel Shared hosting has three types of user levels.</p>
<p><b>Server Administrator</b> &minus; This user is the root user of a cPanel Linux Server and has all the permission over the server. Server Admin can create, modify or delete any account from the cPanel Server. The Server Admin has access to cPanel WHM (Web Host Manger), which can be understood as the backend of cPanel.</p>
<p><b>Reseller Accounts</b> &minus; This user is created by the server administrator and server administrator can choose which type of permissions should be given to reseller accounts. A Reseller account can further create user accounts and has access to all those accounts, which they have created. One reseller account does not have access to the user accounts that were created by another reseller accounts. They also have access to WHM with limited permissions.</p>
<p><b>User Account</b> &minus; These are normal user accounts, each user who subscribes for a web hosting from a company, is given this type of account. They do not have access to Web Host Manager. User account can host single or multiple websites according to their plans they have purchased from web hosting provider.</p>
<h2>Why cPanel</h2>
<p>cPanel is packed with many features that is not provided by other web hosting management panels. It is graphical, hence, non–technical users can also use it perfectly. cPanel is responsive to the screen size, hence can be used in mobile and tablets. It will automatically adapt the screen size of the device.</p>
<p>cPanel is very easy to use and configure. It automatically adjusts all the advanced setting for web hosting. A user hardly needs to go to the command line to configure any settings, as it already has all the features inbuilt.</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>cPanel offers the following advantages &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It is very easy to host a website using cPanel.</p></li>
<li><p>It is multiannual and available in many languages.</p></li>
<li><p>It is responsive and adapts to any screen size, it can be used efficiently in mobile and Tablet too.</p></li>
<li><p>cPanel has in–built File Manager, which helps in managing your files without the hassles of an FTP.</p></li>
<li><p>cPanel has integrated webmail software, which helps in sending and receiving emails through online webmail client.</p></li>
<li><p>You can easily create a backup of your website in a few steps. This will help you to restore your backup, if your website encounters any error.</p></li>
<li><p>You can easily manage your website databases, as cPanel has integrated phpMyAdmin, which helps to directly manage databases.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>cPanel does not have any significant drawbacks, however here are a couple of its notable disadvantages &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>cPanel is a commercial software and you need to pay to get this.</p></li>
<li><p>cPanel is meant for small and medium websites only. Creating a large website using cPanel is not recommended.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>cPanel - Registering a Domain Name</h1>
<p>If you have a website developed locally or you have planned to make a website, then there are two things that you will need — a <b>Domain Name</b> and <b>Web Hosting</b>. A Domain name is the address of your website, which will be used by your users to access it. For example, <b>tutorialspoint.com</b> or google.com these are domain names.</p>
<p>A domain name has two parts, TLD (Top Level Domain) and SLD (Second level domain), for example in <b>tutorialspoint.com</b>, tutorialspoint is second level domain of TLD .com, or you can say it’s a subdomain of .com TLD. There are many top level domains available, like .com, .net, etc. and also country specified TLD like .in, .uk, .ae, etc.</p>
<h2>Importance of a domain</h2>
<p>Getting a domain name of your choice can be very useful. You can use it for many reasons, for instance, you can create the identity of your brand online or you can create a personal blogging website. If you have a business, people will be able to learn about your business remotely.</p>
<h2>Registering a Domain Name</h2>
<p>Domain names are registered with a non–profit organization ICANN. It does not let you register your domain directly, but you will have to go with a domain registrar for this purpose. Domain name registrations involve a registration fee for a year, and you have to renew the domain every year by providing a renewal fee. Domain names cannot be purchased permanently at once, but you have to renew it every year, if you fail to renew the domain, it is automatically deleted from registry.</p>
<p>If you want to register your domain name, then you will have to follow these steps.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Choose a <b>perfect domain name</b> for your website. If it’s a business website, then you may want to go with a domain name, which is the name of your business.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Choose a <b>good domain registrar company</b> having good support infrastructure. For example, GoDaddy or BigRock.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; In the registrar’s website, <b>check if your domain name is available</b> for registration. If the domain you selected has been already registered by someone, then you will have to think of some other domain name. If your domain name is available to register, then you can proceed further.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Provide your contact information and everything that the registrar asked for. It is <b>mandatory</b> that you provide correct information while registering a domain name, as it will be visible to everyone if the user looks for <b>WHOIS</b> information.</p>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; You can hide your contact details by choosing to be viewed by anyone by subscribing <b>privacy protection service</b>. This service hides all your contact information to everyone except the registrar, this service is provided by many domain registrars at some extra cost.</p>
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Complete the purchase by <b>paying the registration fees</b>. Domain name will be registered to you.</p>
<h1>cPanel - Getting Web Hosting</h1>
<p>If you have already registered your domain name, the next step is to get a web hosting for your website. Web hosting is a service, which provides space for your website on internet. If you want your website to publish online, then you will have to get web hosting service.</p>
<p>In a web hosting service, your website is stored in high powered computers called web servers, which are connected to a high speed network and they are powered-on 24/7. While purchasing a web hosting service, you rent a space for your website on these servers.</p>
<p>There are basically three types of web hosting &minus;</p>
<p><b>Shared Hosting</b> &minus; In this type of web hosting, a single server hosts multiple websites, sometimes thousands of them. Each account on this server has certain limits on using disk space to store websites, databases and bandwidth. This is the amount of data transferred through your website. This type of hosting is cheap and suitable for small and medium websites.</p>
<p><b>Virtual Private Servers</b> &minus; In this type of hosting, a Linux Server is divided into several parts and each part acts as a different server, each server has some limited resources given. In this, the VPS administrator has root access to his VPS and can then host single or many websites according to his need. These type of hosting is recommended for medium and large websites. Cost of VPS is higher than Shared Hosting, but lower then Dedicated Hosting.</p>
<p><b>Dedicated Server</b> &minus; In this type of hosting, a whole server is rented to the user, who can host a large website on this server or can use it to host multiple websites in this server, the server admin can create multiple VPS. Cost of dedicated hosting is much higher and it requires a server admin to manage this type of hosting.</p>
<p>If your website is new and it is not expecting much resource usage, then you can go for shared hosting. You can purchase shared hosting for hosting one website or multiple websites according to your need. In this tutorial, we will learn about hosting a website using cPanel, hence it is recommended that you purchase the hosting that comes with cPanel.</p>
<h1>cPanel - Setting Up Nameserver</h1>
<p>When you have purchased your hosting, you will have to connect your domain with the hosting that you have purchased. If you have purchased the domain and hosting from the same provider, then it is liable that your Nameservers are already setup. If you have purchased your domain and hosting from different providers, then you will have to manually add new Nameservers to your domain, so that it can point your domain to the right server.</p>
<p>Nameservers are a part of Domain Name System. These DNS servers keep the records of which domain is connected to which IP address. Nameservers allow us to use a domain instead of IP address of the DNS server. When a visitor types the URL of your domain then the DNS server tells the browser that from which server it should load content from. In easy words, Nameservers define the current DNS provider of your domain.</p>
<p>When you get the email of the Login details of your web hosting server along with it, you also get the details of your Nameservers. Most hosting providers use their own DNS servers.

<h1>cPanel - File Permissions</h1>
<p>All files and directories in Linux Operating System has access permissions. This feature gives the ability to the user for setting up different access levels for each user and also Operating system gets the ability to deal with different request for accessing the file. This feature makes system more secure to potential security threats. There are three types of access permissions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Read</b> &minus; It is denoted by ‘r’ and number 4, it gives ability to the user for reading the file only.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Write</b> &minus; It is denoted by ‘w’ and number 2, it gives ability to the user for writing into the file only.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Execute</b> &minus; It is denoted by ‘x’ and number 1, it gives ability to user for executing the file only.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Access permissions can be given in groups too, for example, if we want to give a file to read and write permission only, we can assign ‘rw–‘ to that file or in numerical form, we can assign number 6 – as 4 for read and 2 for write equals to 6.</p>
<p>These access permissions are given to three types of users &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>User</b> &minus; It is owner of the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Group</b> &minus; It is the group of users in which Owner lies.</p></li>
<li><p><b>World</b> &minus; It is referred to everyone else.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We give access permissions according to file types in cPanel. By default, cPanel File Manager gives 6-4-4 permissions to the users – 6 to the User, 4 to the Group and 4 to the World. Most of the time we do not need to change the file permissions unless needed.</p>

<h1>cPanel - Disk Usage</h1>
<p>cPanel Disk Usage is a very efficient way to monitor your accounts available and use disk spaces. This feature scans your disk to provide you a graphical overview of the Disk usage. It displays disk space used by directories, but it does not show how much space is consumed by an individual file. It also displays information of disk quota used by MySQL Databases, hidden directories and Emails.</p>

For example, if you moved your website to a new domain and you want to redirect all your visitors to new website, you need to setup redirect. There are two types of redirects available &minus;</p>
<h3>Permanent (301) Redirect</h3>
<p>This one redirects your visitors to a new website and updates your visitor’s bookmarks. This also directs search engines to your new website.

Popularity and SEO of link remains same as the old link had.</p>
<h3>Temporary (302) Redirect</h3>
<p>This one redirects your visitors to a new website, but does not update your visitor’s bookmark. Search Engines still index your original website.

<h1>cPanel - Simple Zone Editor</h1>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a very essential part of Internet System. It simply maps a FQDN (Full Qualified Domain Name), which is in human readable form. For example, www.tutorialspoint.com to IP address, which are used by computer machine, e.g. 117.18.237.191. For this process, DNS uses zone files that are stored in servers, which contains resource records to map a domain name to an IP address.</p>
<p>In this Simple Zone Editor, we can add two types of records &minus;</p>
<h2>Add an A Record</h2>
<p>The <b>A</b> types of resource records are Host Name records. They contain the IP address of a specific host, and maps the Domain Name with 32-bit IP address.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Press <b>Add an A Record</b>. If successful, you will get a success message.</p>
<p><i><b>Note</b> &minus; <b>‘A’</b> records are essential for accessing your website. They allow DNS servers to locate your website and its services. Without an <b>‘A’</b> record, visitors can’t access your website. The cPanel automatically configures <b>A</b> type records for your domain and website, as soon as they are created.</i></p>
<h2>Add a CNAME Record</h2>
<p>The CNAME records are used to add an Alias to its associated domain name. You can point multiple CNAME records to a single <b>A</b> record. So that when the DNS looks up for the Alias, you can simply rename a host, which is defined in the <b>A</b> records.</p>
<p>To add a CNAME record, please follow these steps.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Scroll down on Simple Zone Editor to find <b>Add a CNAME Record</b>.</p>
<img src="images/cname_record.jpg" alt="CNAME Record" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Enter the desired Alias name for CNAME record on Name textbox and Enter a FQDN in CNAME textbox to which you want your Alias pointing to.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Click <b>Add CNAME Record</b> and you should see a success message.</p>

<h1>cPanel - Authentications</h1>
<p>Email Authentications prevent the email from going into the spam folder of recipients. cPanel uses DKIM and SPF to reduce the amount of spam mails. Enabling these features will prevent spammers from forging messages that claims to be coming from your domain.</p>
<h2>DKIM</h2>
<p>Domain Key Identification Mechanism (DKIM) verifies your incoming emails to check whether they are same as they were before when they were sent. This means, if they are altered during the transit. It also checks whether they are from the same address, whom they claim to be. This feature prevents incoming spam emails.</p>
<p>When DKIM is enabled, the sender signs the email with a digital signature using a private key. When the email approaches the recipient, it retrieves the public key of its sender and checks if the signature matches. If the signature is invalid, then message is treated as a spam message.</p>
<h3>Enabling DKIM</h3>
