<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP HANA is an in-memory database for performing real-time data analysis, and development of applications on the top of real-time data. HANA administration deals with managing SAP HANA system in a single and distributed system environment. Each HANA system can contain multi node architecture with each node containing multiple processors for fast speed data analysis and real-time data provisioning. You can use Smart data access to get the data from non-SAP systems without importing the data to HANA database, and virtual tables can be used to perform read/write data operations</p>
<p>SAP HANA Administration includes the following activities &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAP HANA multiple host system management</li>
<li>SAP HANA Administration Tools</li>
<li>SAP HANA System Management and Availability</li>
<li>SAP HANA Lifecycle Management</li>
<li>SAP HANA Security and User Management</li>
<li>SAP HANA Backup and Recovery Management</li>
<li>SAP HANA Data Provisioning and Integration with non-SAP systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Each SAP system contains multiple servers and it can be checked in HANA Studio under Administration tab. SAP HANA Studio contains Administration Perspective (default) to manage all admin tasks in HANA systems.</p>
<p>To check the landscape of HANA system, navigate to Landscape tab in HANA studio. Services shows all the services running on HANA system.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows SAP HANA system and all the key services running under system Landscape for the same system.</p>
<p>You can see the service name corresponding to each server in HANA system landscape.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/services.jpg" alt="Services" />
<p>From the dropdown list, you can select all the host names and services that you want to see and the status of each system.</p>
<p>Various details available for each service includes: Start time, CPU and Memory details, Used Memory, Peak Used Memory, Effective Allocation Unit, Physical Memory on host, and SQL Port.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/landscape.jpg" alt="Landscape" />
<p>When you click the Hosts tab, you can see the host names in the System Landscape and the role of HANA system defined under Name server.</p>
<p>You can also check the status of the systems, failover status, Index server role, and Failover group.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/hosts_tab.jpg" alt="Hosts Tab" />
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Architecture Overview</h1>
<p>In SAP HANA system architecture, it contains all the server components that gets installed at the time of installation. Each server has defined set of tasks and different services are run for each server in a SAP HANA distributed environment.</p>
<p>The most important server system and the heart of HANA system is the Index server. This server is responsible for processing SQL/MDX statement using engines in the Index server. It also contains Session and Transaction Manager to keep track of completed and running transactions.</p>
<p>Persistence Layer in the Index server is used for backing up data and transaction of log files.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture" />
<p>Following table lists all the key server components in HANA, the corresponding services, and OS process details.</p>

<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Multitenant Database</h1>
<p>It is possible to set up multiple databases into a single HANA system. When you install SAP HANA system in multiple container mode, you can setup multiple isolated databases in single SAP HANA system. This is called <b>Multitenant database containers</b>.</p>
<p>You can also covert a single container HANA system to multiple container databases HANA system. In multiple container HANA system, each database runs on the same infrastructure and uses the same computing resources. However, each database contains following components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Database Users</li>
<li>Repository</li>
<li>Catalog</li>
<li>Backups</li>
<li>Traces and Logs</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
</ul>
<p>All the database objects - tables, schemas, database views, SQL procedures - are separate for each database. You can also perform cross-database functions in multitenant database.</p>
<p>In SAP HANA system, it contains multiple server - Name Server, Index Server, Preprocessor, and XS Server. With multiple container databases, different combinations of the above servers are used.</p>
<p>Name server maintains the landscape details of the system and the system databases run the Name server. The Name server of multitenant databases doesn’t contain topology information and this information is stored in tenant database catalog.</p>
<p>Preprocessor and Compile server runs on system databases as they don’t contain persist data. Each tenant database contain its own index server and SAP HANA Classic Server runs on the Index server of tenant database by default.</p>
<p>You can see the architecture of SAP HANA multiple container system in the following screenshot. Each instance of system database runs on multiple hosts to provide scalability and system availability. In multiple worker configuration, when a system fails, standby instance will fail over all active databases.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/multitenanat.jpg" alt="Multitenant" />
<p>In the above screenshot, you can see 2 databases distributed across three hosts in multiple container database system.</p>
<p>In multiple container architecture, the system database is set up at the time of installation of a multiple-container system or when you convert a single container system to multiple container system. This is used to manage information about the system as a whole, and also for tenant databases. It is used for Central System Administration in multitenant environment.</p>
<p>System database contains data and user data for system administration and SAP HANA Administration tools such as SAP HANA Studio to connect to the system database. All the administration tasks that are performed in the system database applies to the whole system and you can also target the configuration for a specific tenant database. System database contains complete landscape information about Tenant components, however it doesn’t contain topology related information.</p>
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Multiple Host Systems</h1>
<p>When your SAP HANA system is installed on a single system, it is known as <b>Single Host System</b>; however, when you distribute the system installation on multiple systems, it is called <b>Multiple Host Systems</b>. Using multiple host systems, you can use features such as Load Balancing and Scale Out feature of SAP HANA system. You can overcome the hardware limitations by distributing the load of your system on multiple servers.</p>
<p>You can also assign different tables to different hosts using database partition to split a single table between hosts (partitioning of tables), and to replicate tables to multiple hosts.</p>
<p>When SAP HANA system is installed on multiple hosts, SAP HANA Administrator can perform start and stop, backup, or run update as a single system by taking single System ID known as SID.</p>
<p>Each SAP HANA system contains its own server components for each host and the request from the client application can be distributed to different hosts in multiple host systems.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/multiple_host_system.jpg" alt="Multiple Host System" />
<p>In the above screenshot, you can see SAP HANA multiple host system architecture, where HANA system has 3 separate instances, and each instance has its own server components.</p>

<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Table Management</h1>
<p>SAP HANA supports all the database functions that can be performed in a conventional database. You can create database tables, views, triggers, synonyms, stored procedures, and other database functions. In SAP HANA, you can create two types of tables &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Row Store</li>
<li>Column Store</li>
</ul>
<p>SAP HANA column store tables are suitable to perform performance optimized read operations and also to perform write operations. You can achieve a data compression up to 11 times, and searches and calculations can be performed much faster as compared to column store tables. Data Partitioning feature of SAP HANA is only available to column store tables and SAP HANA Data modeling can be used only on column store tables.</p>
<p>Row store tables are more suitable for performing INSERT and UPDATE SQL statements on small size tables.</p>
<p>In SAP HANA database, it is possible to join different store table types - Row store table can be joined to a column store table but it is recommended to join similar table types together to keep the performance high.</p>
<h2>Creating a Table in HANA Database Using GUI Option in HANA Studio</h2>
<p>Right-click on Table tab under Schema &rarr; Select ‘New Table’ option as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p>Once you click on New Table, it will open a window to enter the Table name. Choose Schema name from the dropdown &rarr; Define Table type from the dropdown list: Column Store or Row Store.</p>
<p>Define data type as shown in the following screenshot, columns can be added by clicking the (+) sign. Primary Key can be chosen by clicking the cell under Primary key in front of Column name. Not Null will be active by default. Once columns are added, click Execute.</p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the Table Type as Column Store. You have an option to create a Row store table by selecting Row Store from the dropdown list.</p>
<p>While using SQL statement to create a table, you need to mention “Column” keyword in Create Table command. By default, it creates a Row store table using SQL Editor.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/column.jpg" alt="Column" />
<p>Once you Execute (F8), right-click Table Tab &rarr; Refresh. The new table will be reflected in the list of tables under the chosen Schema.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can also change the table type in SAP HANA database using the following Alter command in SQL Editor.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Alter table_name Column; 
</pre>
<h2>Benefits of Using Column Store Tables</h2>
<p>Following are the advantages of using Column store tables as compared to Row store &minus;</p>
<h3>Performance Optimized Column Operations</h3>
<p>You can perform complex calculations and aggregations much faster as compared to Row Store tables. This removes the need to store aggregated tables in HANA database and hence also saves the memory space.</p>
<h3>Built-In Indexes for Column Tables</h3>
<p>Using columnar data structure for tables removes the need of Indexes as when you store data in columns it works like a built-in index for each column. This saves the memory space and also improves the performance during write operations.</p>
<h3>Data Compression</h3>
<p>When you store column based tables in HANA database, similar data types are stored continuous in memory. It allows you to apply various data compression techniques such as - Run Length Compressed, Dictionary Compressed, hence reducing the space required to store the tables. You can achieve a data compression as high as 11 times as compared to conventional database.</p>
<h3>Parallel Processing</h3>
<p>With the use of multi core processors, you can perform parallel processing on column store tables. As data is stored vertically, column operations can easily be processed on column based tables.</p>
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Table Partition</h1>
<p>Using Partitioning, you can split column store tables into smaller tables in a multiple host system. You can even divide tables into smaller more manageable parts using partitioning. Partitioning can be done using DML SQL statements.</p>
<p>When a table is partitioned it contains different set of rows for each part and Partitioning can be done based on different algorithms - Hash Partitioning, Single Level or multilevel Partitioning.</p>
<p>Following are the advantages of using Table Partitioning &minus;</p>
<h3>Partitioning Pruning</h3>
<p>You can determine if a query can be analyzed in a particular partition. Using this method, you can reduce the load on the system and hence improve the response time.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; When you partition a table based on the year, a query is executed to analyze the data for a particular year. You can use specific partition and hence query performance is improved.</p>
<h3>Load Balancing</h3>
<p>You can divide individual partitions on multiple hosts and hence a query is not processed by a single server, results in better load balancing on all the servers hosting table partitions.</p>
<h3>Size Limitation</h3>
<p>In a column store table, maximum number of rows that can be entered is around 2 billion. You can overcome this by distributing the rows of a column table on multiple partitions and hence the size limit is increased to 2 billion for each partition.</p>
<h3>Improved Delta Merge Operation</h3>
<p>During delta merge, if data is only modified for some partitions, you need to merge less partitions in delta merge.</p>
<h3>Parallel Processing of Queries</h3>
<p>Using partitions, you can run multiple queries in parallel and hence improve the response time.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the types of partionining.</p>
<h2>Single Level Partitioning</h2>
<p>There are different types of single level partitioning available in SAP HANA system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Hash Partitioning</li>
<li>Round Robin Partitioning</li>
<li>Range Partitioning</li> 
</ul>
<p>In Hash partitioning, rows are distributed equally to perform load balancing. You don’t require the detailed information about table content in this Partitioning type.</p>
<p>As compared to Hash Partitioning, in Round Robin Partitioning rows are equally distributed to each partition and new rows are equally assigned to each partition.</p>
<p>To create 4 partitions of a table using Round Robin, you can use the following SQL queries. No primary keys should be defined.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE COLUMN TABLE TABLENAME (a INT, b INT, c INT) 
PARTITION BY ROUNDROBIN PARTITIONS 4 
</pre>
<p>This command will create 4 partitions of a table.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/command.jpg" alt="Command" />
<p></p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE COLUMN TABLE Table_Name (a INT, b INT, c INT, PRIMARY KEY (a,b)) 
PARTITION BY HASH (a, b) PARTITIONS 4 
</pre>
<p>This will create 4 partitions on column <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, and you need to specify at least one column.</p>
<h2>Range Partitioning</h2>
<p>In Range partitioning, you create dedicated partitions for certain values and you should have in-depth knowledge of table contents for partitioning columns.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; Creating one partition for each calendar month.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE COLUMN TABLE TABLE_NAME (a INT, b INT, c INT, PRIMARY KEY (a,b)) 
PARTITION BY RANGE (a) 
(PARTITION 1 &lt;= VALUES &lt; 10, PARTITION 10 &lt;= VALUES &lt; 20, 
PARTITION VALUE = 50, PARTITION  OTHERS) 
</pre>
<p>This will create 4 partitions, one for partition range 1 to 10, 2<sup>nd</sup> from 10 to 20, 3<sup>rd</sup> for value 50, and 4<sup>th</sup> for all other values.</p>
<h2>Multilevel Partitioning</h2>
<p>In multilevel partitioning, you can overcome the limitation of HASH and RANGE single level partitioning to use key columns as partitioning columns. Using multilevel partitioning, you can partition a column that is not a primary key. The most common type of multilevel partitioning is <b>HASH-Range Partitioning</b>.</p>
<p>In Hash-Range multilevel partitioning, you implement Hash partitioning at the first level to implement load balancing and Range partitioning at the second level to implement timebased partitioning.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE COLUMN TABLE Table_name (a INT, b INT, c INT, PRIMARY KEY (a,b))
PARTITION BY HASH (a, b) PARTITIONS 4,
RANGE (c) (PARTITION 1 &lt;= VALUES &lt; 10, PARTITION 10 &lt;= VALUES &lt; 20) 
</pre>
<p>Instead of using Hash partitioning at the first level, you can also use Round Robin partitioning and it is known as <b>Round Robin-Range multilevel partitioning</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE COLUMN TABLE Table_name (a INT, b INT, c INT) 
PARTITION BY ROUNDROBIN PARTITIONS 4,
RANGE (c) (PARTITION 1 &lt;= VALUES &lt; 10, PARTITION 10 &lt;= VALUES &lt; 20) 
</pre>
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Table Replication</h1>
<p>In SAP HANA system, it is also possible to replicate tables on multiple hosts. When you need to join the tables or partition tables on multiple hosts, table replication is useful to improve the performance, to reduce the load on the network in a distributed environment.</p>
<p>SAP HANA table replication has certain limitations &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can’t replicate Partitioned Tables.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are using SAP BW on HANA, it doesn’t support Table replication.</p></li>
<li><p>When you perform table replication, it consumes the main memory and disk space to store persistence of each replica.</p></li>
<li><p>Column store tables with history tables and text columns without a primary key can’t be replicated.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Create Column Store Tables with Replica on All Hosts in Multiple Container System</h2>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE COLUMN TABLE Table_Name (I INT PRIMARY KEY) REPLICA AT ALL LOCATIONS 
</pre>
<p>This command will create a column store table with a replica on each host. You can also replicate an existing column base table on each available host using ALTER table command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ALTER TABLE Table_Name ADD REPLICA AT ALL LOCATIONS 
</pre>
<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/sql_command.jpg" alt="SQL Command" />
<p>It is also possible to drop replica of an existing table using ALTER table drop replica command as follows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ALTER TABLE Table_name DROP REPLICA AT ALL LOCATIONS 
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You can perform Table Replication on row store tables.</p></li>
<li><p>In a distributed environment, you can perform table replications on row store tables stored in master node.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In SAP HANA system, you can also perform consistency check on replicated tables using the following SQL command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CALL CHECK_TABLE_CONSISTENCY('CHECK_REPLICATION', '&lt;schema&gt;', '&lt;table'&gt;) 
</pre>
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Data Compression</h1>
<p>Using SAP Column store tables, you can perform data compression up to 11 times, which results in a cost-saving solution to store more data in HANA database. Column store tables also provide faster data access, search, and complex calculations.</p>
<p>The ratio of uncompressed data size to compressed data size is known as <b>Compression Factor</b>. The compressed table size is the size occupied by the table in the main memory of SAP HANA database.</p>
<h2>Check Compression of a Column Table</h2>
<p>Using SAP HANA Studio, you can find out the compression status of a column store table and also the compression factor. To find compression details, you need to first load the table into memory.</p>
<p>To load a table into SAP HANA memory, you should have &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>System privilege</b> &minus; TABLE ADMIN</p></li>
<li><p><b>Object privilege</b> &minus; UPDATE for the table or the schema in which the table is located</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/column_table.jpg" alt="Column Table" />
<p>You can also load a table using SQL command. Open the SQL console and execute the following statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
LOAD &lt;table_name&gt;  
UNLOAD &lt;table_name&gt;
</pre>
<p>Note that when you load a table, it loads the complete data and also delta storage into the main memory of SAP HANA system.</p>
<p>To perform data compression, run the following SQL command to check data compression properties.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SELECT SCHEMA_NAME, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, COMPRESSION_TYPE, LOADED from  
PUBLIC.M_CS_COLUMNS where SCHEMA_NAME = '&lt;your_schema&gt;' and TABLE_NAME = '&lt;your_table&gt;' 
</pre>
<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/command_check.jpg" alt="Command Check" />
<p>You can check the output in Result tab.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/result_tab.jpg" alt="Result" />
<p>To check the Compression ratio for a table, you can navigate to Table Definition. Go to Runtime Information.</p>
<p>To see Compression Ratio, go to Columns tab. You can see the compression ratio in the Main Size Compression Ratio [%] column.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/ratio.jpg" alt="Ratio" />
<h2>Compress a Table Manually in SAP HANA</h2>
<p>It is also possible to compress a table in SAP HANA system manually by executing the following SQL statement.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
UPDATE "table_name" WITH PARAMETERS ('OPTIMIZE_COMPRESSION' = 'YES') 
</pre>
<p>This results in deciding whether a compression is required or an existing compression can be optimized. In this scenario, HANA system uses most suitable compression algorithm.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/compress_table.jpg" alt="Compress Table" />
<p></p>
<p>When you run the above SQL command, compression status remains the same. You can also force the database to reevaluate compression using the following SQL status &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
UPDATE "AA_HANA11"."SHOP_FACTS" WITH PARAMETERS ('OPTIMIZE_COMPRESSION' = 'FORCE')
</pre>
<p></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/sql_status.jpg" alt="SQL Status" />
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Solman Integration</h1>
<p>You can also support your SAP HANA system by using SAP Solution Manager. To make two systems communicate with each other, you need to register your SAP HANA system to SAP solution manager’s System Landscape Directory (SLD). This directory contains the information about the landscape and software component versions. A SAP system can be configured to register under SLD.

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/view_security_settings.jpg" alt="View Security Settings" />
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - User Provisioning</h1>
<p>SAP HANA user and role management configuration depends on the architecture of your HANA system. If SAP HANA is integrated with BI platform tools and acts as a reporting database, then the end user and the role are managed in the application server.</p>
<p>If the end user directly connects to SAP HANA database, then the user and the role in the database layer of HANA system is required for both end users and administrators.</p>
<p>Every user who wants to work with HANA database must have a database user with necessary privileges. User accessing HANA system can either be a technical user or an end user depending on the access requirement. After successful logon to the system, the user’s authorization to perform the required operation is verified. Executing that operation depends on the privileges that the user has been granted. These privileges can be granted using roles in HANA Security. HANA Studio is one of the powerful tools to manage the user and the roles for HANA database system.</p>
<h2>User Types</h2>
<p>User types vary according to the security policies and different privileges assigned to the user profile. User type can be a technical database user or an end user. The user needs access to HANA system for reporting the purpose or for data manipulation.</p>
<h3>Standard Users</h3>
<p>Standard users are the users who can create objects in their own Schemas and have Read access in the system Information models. Read access is provided by PUBLIC role, which is assigned to every standard user.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/standard_users.jpg" alt="Standard Users" />
<h3>Restricted Users</h3>
<p>Restricted users are those users who access HANA system with some applications and they don’t have SQL privileges on HANA system. When these users are created they don’t have any access initially.</p>
<p>If we compare restricted users with Standard users &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Restricted users can’t create objects in HANA database or their own Schemas.</p></li>
<li><p>They don’t have access to view any data in the database as they don’t have generic Public role added to profile like standard users.</p></li>
<li><p>They can connect to HANA database only using HTTP/HTTPS.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>HANA Users Administration and Role Management</h3>
<p>Technical database users are used only for administrative purpose such as creating new objects in the database, assigning privileges to other users, on packages, applications, etc.</p>
<h3>SAP HANA User Administration Activities</h3>
<p>Depending on the business needs and the configuration of HANA system, there are different user activities that can be performed using user administration tools such as HANA studio.</p>
<p>Most common activities include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Create users</li>
<li>Grant roles to users</li>
<li>Define and create roles</li>
<li>Delete users</li>
<li>Reset user passwords</li>
<li>Reactivate users after too many failed logon attempts</li>
<li>Deactivate users when it is required</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create Users in HANA Studio</h2>
<p>Only database users with the system privilege ROLE ADMIN are allowed to create users and roles in HANA Studio. To create users and roles in HANA Studio, go to HANA Administrator Console. You will see the security tab in System view.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/create_users_in_hana_studio.jpg" alt="Create Users in HANA Studio" />
<p>When you expand the security tab, it gives an option of User and Roles. To create a new user, right-click on the User and go to New User. A new window will open where you define User and User parameters.</p>
<p>Enter the user name (mandate) and in the Authentication field enter the password. Password is applied while saving password for a new user. You can also choose to create a restricted user.</p>
<p>The specified role name must not be identical to the name of an existing user or role. The password rules include a minimal password length and a definition of which character types (lower, upper, digit, special characters) have to be part of the password.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/user.jpg" alt="User" />
<p>Different authorization methods can be configured such as SAML, X509 certificates, SAP Logon ticket, etc. Users in the database can be authenticated by varying mechanisms &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Internal authentication mechanism using a password.</p></li>
<li><p>External mechanisms such as Kerberos, SAML, SAP Logon Ticket, SAP Assertion Ticket or X.509.</p></li>
<li><p>A user can be authenticated by more than one mechanism at a time. However only one password and one principal name for Kerberos can be valid at any one time. One authentication mechanism has to be specified to allow the user to connect and work with the database instance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It also gives an option to define the validity of the user. You can mention the validity interval by selecting the dates. Validity specification is an optional user parameter.</p>
<p>There are some users that are by default delivered with the SAP HANA database: SYS, SYSTEM, _SYS_REPO, _SYS_STATISTICS.</p>
<p>Once this is done, next is to define the privileges for the user profile.</p>
<h2>Types of Privileges to User Profile</h2>
<p>There are different types of privileges that can be added to the user profile.</p>
<h3>Granted Role</h3>
<p>This is used to add inbuilt sap.hana roles to the user profile or to add custom roles created under Roles tab. Custom roles allow you to define roles as per access requirement and you can add these roles directly to the user profile. This removes the need to remember and add objects to a user profile every time for different access types.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/grated_role.jpg" alt="Grated Role" />
<h3>Public Role</h3>
<p>This is a generic role and is assigned to all database users by default. This role contains read-only access to system views and execute privileges for some procedures. These roles cannot be revoked.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/public_role.jpg" alt="Public Role" />
<h3>Modeling</h3>

<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Authentication Methods</h1>
<p>All SAP HANA users who have access to HANA database are verified with different Authentication methods. SAP HANA system supports various types of authentication methods and all these login methods are configured at the time of profile creation.</p>
<p>Following is the list of authentication methods supported by SAP HANA &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>User name/Password</li>
<li>Kerberos</li>
<li>SAML 2.0</li>
<li>SAP Logon tickets</li>
<li>X.509</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/authentication.jpg" alt="Authentication" />
<h3>User Name/Password</h3>
<p>This method requires HANA user to enter the user name and password to login to database. This user profile is created under User management in HANA Studio &rarr; Security Tab.</p>
<p>Password should be as per password policy. For example - Password length, complexity, lower and upper case letters, etc. You can change the password policy as per your organization’s security standards.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The password policy cannot be deactivated.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/saptest.jpg" alt="SAPTEST" />
<h3>Kerberos</h3>
<p>All users who connect to HANA database system using an external authentication method should also have a database user. It is required to map the external login to the internal database user.</p>
<p>This method enables the users to authenticate HANA system directly, using JDBC/ODBC drivers through the network or by using front-end applications in SAP Business Objects.</p>
<p>It also allows HTTP access in HANA Extended Service using HANA XS engine. It uses SPENGO mechanism for Kerberos authentication.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/kerberos.jpg" alt="Kerberos" />
<h3>SAML</h3>
<p>SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and can be used to authenticate the users accessing HANA system directly from ODBC/JDBC clients. It can also be used to authenticate the users in HANA system, coming via HTTP through HANA XS engine.</p>
<p>SAML is used only for authentication purposes and not for authorization.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/saml.jpg" alt="SAML" />
<h2>SAP Logon and Assertion Tickets</h2>
<p>SAP Logon/assertion tickets can be used to authenticate the users in HANA system. These tickets are issued to the users when they login into SAP system, which is configured to issue tickets such as SAP Portal, etc. User specified in SAP logon tickets should be created in HANA system as it doesn’t provide support for the mapping users.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/sap_logon.jpg" alt="SAP Logon" />
<h2>X.509 Client Certificates</h2>
<p>X.509 certificates can also be used to login to HANA system via HTTP access request from HANA XS engine. Users are authenticated by certificates that are signed from trusted Certificate Authority, which is stored in HANA XS system.</p>
<p>The user in trusted certificate should exist in HANA system as there is no support for user mapping.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/client_certificates.jpg" alt="Client Certificates" />
<h2>Single Sign On in HANA System</h2>
<p>Single sign on can be configured in HANA system, which allows the users to login to HANA system from an initial authentication on the client. User logins at client applications using different authentication methods and SSO allows the user to access HANA system directly.</p>
<p>SSO can be configured using the following configuration methods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAML</li>
<li>Kerberos</li>
<li>X.509 client certificates for HTTP access from HANA XS engine</li>
<li>SAP Logon/Assertion tickets</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use SAP HANA Cockpit for performing user and role management tasks.</p>

<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Data Provisioning</h1>
<p>SAP HANA Replication allows the migration of data from source systems to SAP HANA database. A simple way to move data from the existing SAP system to HANA is by using various data replication techniques.</p>
<p>System replication can be set up on the console via command line or by using HANA studio. The primary ECC or transaction systems can stay online during this process. There are three types of data replication methods in HANA system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAP LT Replication method</li>
<li>ETL tool SAP Business Object Data Service (BODS) method</li>
<li>Direct Extractor Connection method (DXC)</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP LT Replication Method</h2>
<p>SAP Landscape Transformation (SLT) Replication is a trigger-based data replication method in HANA system. It is a perfect solution for replicating real-time data or schedulebased replication from SAP and non-SAP sources. It has SAP LT Replication server, which takes care of all trigger requests. Replication server can be installed as a standalone server or can run on any SAP system with SAP NW 7.02 or above.</p>
<p>There is a trusted RFC connection between HANA DB and ECC transaction system, which enables trigger-based data replication in HANA system environment.</p>
<h2>ETL SAP Data Services Replication</h2>
<p>SAP HANA ETL based replication uses SAP Data Services to migrate data from SAP or nonSAP source system to target HANA database. BODS system is an ETL tool used to extract, transform, and load data from the source system to the target system.</p>
<p>It enables to read the business data at the Application layer. You need to define data flows in Data Services, scheduling a replication job, and defining the source and the target system in data store in Data Services designer.</p>
<h2>Direct Extractor Connection Method (DXC)</h2>
<p>Direct Extractor Connection data replication reuses the existing extraction, transformation, and load mechanism built into SAP Business Suite systems via a simple HTTP(S) connection to SAP HANA. It is a batch-driven data replication technique. It is considered as a method for extraction, transformation, and load with limited capabilities for data extraction.</p>
<p>DXC is a batch-driven process and data extraction using DXC at certain interval is enough in many cases. You can set an interval when batch job executes, for example, every 20 minutes. In most of the cases it is sufficient to extract data using these batch jobs at certain time intervals.</p>
<p>You can check complete details about Data Provisioning in our SAP HANA tutorial &minus;</p>

<p>Once you set up the connection, it can be used to perform read/write functions in remote system and to join the tables for data provisioning.</p>
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Integration with Hadoop</h1>
<p>In SAP HANA system, you can also integrate SAP HANA computing power with Hadoop to process huge amount of data at faster speed. Hadoop system is used for storing huge amount of unstructured data and HANA provides high speed data analysis.</p>
<p>Following scenarios can be used to connect SAP HANA system to Hadoop &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Hive ODBC Driver</li>
<li>Smart Data Integration</li>
<li>HANA Spark Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>To use Smart Data Access to connect to Hadoop system in HANA Studio, select Adapter Name: Hadoop</p>
<p>In Connection Properties, enter the URL and Credentials.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/connection_properties.jpg" alt="Connection Properties" />
<p>You can also use the following SQL statement to create a remote connection to connect to Hadoop system. We have selected Authentication type as Password here &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CREATE REMOTE SOURCE RC_Hadoop 
ADAPTER "hadoop" 
CONFIGURATION 'webhdfs_url = http:// 
&lt;full_qualified_domain_name&gt; 
: 
50070;webhcat_url = http:// 
&lt;full_qualified_domain_name&gt; 
:50111' 
WITH CREDENTIAL TYPE 'PASSWORD' 
USING 'user = username;password = pwd'; 
</pre>
<p>Enter the above SQL statement in HANA Studio SQL editor and click the Execute button.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_hana_administration/images/sql_editor.jpg" alt="SQL Editor" />
<p>This way you can integrate your SAP HANA system with Hadoop using Smart data integration in HANA Studio.</p>
<h1>SAP HANA Admin - Key Commands</h1>
<h3>Display the general information about HANA database and has to be executed in the command line</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
hdbsql -n localhost -i 1 -u username -p Password \s 
</pre>
<p>This command will display the details of HANA database such as the host name, database, user, Kernel version, SQLDBC version, etc.</p>
<h3>View the concurrent database login to HANA database</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
hdbsql -n localhost -i 1 -u username -p Password 
"SELECT CNO,TITLE,FIRSTNAME,NAME,ZIP FROM Database_Name" 
</pre>
<p>The above command displays the following result about concurrent sessions &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
CNO | TITLE | FIRSTNAME | NAME | ZIP 
</pre>
<h3>Start and stop HANA database from HDB</h3>
<p>To start and stop HANA database using HDB, you have to login to HANA system host as &lt;sid&gt;adm and run the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
/usr/sap/&lt;SID&gt;/HDB&lt;instance number&gt;/HDB start 
/usr/sap/&lt;SID&gt;/HDB&lt;instance number&gt;/HDB stop 
</pre>
