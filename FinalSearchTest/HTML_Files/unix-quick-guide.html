<h1>Unix - Getting Started</h1>
<h2>What is Unix ?</h2>
<p>The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.</p>
<p>The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the <b>operating system</b> or the <b>kernel</b>.</p>
<p>Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the <b>shell</b>. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Unix was originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&amp;T employees Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Labs.</p></li>
<li><p>There are various Unix variants available in the market. Solaris Unix, AIX, HP Unix and BSD are a few examples. Linux is also a flavor of Unix which is freely available.</p></li>
<li><p>Several people can use a Unix computer at the same time; hence Unix is called a multiuser system.</p></li>
<li><p>A user can also run multiple programs at the same time; hence Unix is a multitasking environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Unix Architecture</h2>
<p>Here is a basic block diagram of a Unix system &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/images/unix_architecture.jpg" alt="Unix Architecture" />
<p>The main concept that unites all the versions of Unix is the following four basics &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Kernel</b> &minus; The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Shell</b> &minus; The shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell are the most famous shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Commands and Utilities</b> &minus; There are various commands and utilities which you can make use of in your day to day activities. <b>cp</b>, <b>mv</b>, <b>cat</b> and <b>grep</b>, etc. are few examples of commands and utilities. There are over 250 standard commands plus numerous others provided through 3<sup>rd</sup> party software. All the commands come along with various options.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Files and Directories</b> &minus; All the data of Unix is organized into files. All files are then organized into directories. These directories are further organized into a tree-like structure called the <b>filesystem</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>System Bootup</h3>
<p>If you have a computer which has the Unix operating system installed in it, then you simply need to turn on the system to make it live.</p>
<p>As soon as you turn on the system, it starts booting up and finally it prompts you to log into the system, which is an activity to log into the system and use it for your day-to-day activities.</p>
<h3>Login Unix</h3>
<p>When you first connect to a Unix system, you usually see a prompt such as the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
login:
</pre>
<h3>To log in</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Have your userid (user identification) and password ready. Contact your system administrator if you don't have these yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Type your userid at the login prompt, then press <b>ENTER</b>. Your userid is <b>case-sensitive</b>, so be sure you type it exactly as your system administrator has instructed.</p></li>
<li><p>Type your password at the password prompt, then press <b>ENTER</b>. Your password is also case-sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>If you provide the correct userid and password, then you will be allowed to enter into the system. Read the information and messages that comes up on the screen, which is as follows.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="result notranslate">
login : amrood
amrood's password:
Last login: Sun Jun 14 09:32:32 2009 from 62.61.164.73
$
</pre>
<p>You will be provided with a command prompt (sometime called the <b>$</b> prompt ) where you type all your commands. For example, to check calendar, you need to type the <b>cal</b> command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cal
     June 2009
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
    1  2  3  4  5  6
 7  8  9 10 11 12 13

21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 29 30

$
</pre>
<h3>Change Password</h3>
<p>All Unix systems require passwords to help ensure that your files and data remain your own and that the system itself is secure from hackers and crackers. Following are the steps to change your password &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To start, type password at the command prompt as shown below.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Enter your old password, the one you're currently using.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Type in your new password. Always keep your password complex enough so that nobody can guess it. But make sure, you remember it.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; You must verify the password by typing it again.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ passwd
Changing password for amrood
(current) Unix password:******
New UNIX password:*******
Retype new UNIX password:*******
passwd: all authentication tokens updated  successfully

$
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; We have added asterisk (*) here just to show the location where you need to enter the current and new passwords otherwise at your system. It does not show you any character when you type.</p>
<h3>Listing Directories and Files</h3>
<p>All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.</p>
<p>You can use the <b>ls</b> command to list out all the files or directories available in a directory. Following is the example of using <b>ls</b> command with <b>-l</b> option.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ ls -l
total 19621
drwxrwxr-x  2 amrood amrood      4096 Dec 25 09:59 uml
-rw-rw-r--  1 amrood amrood      5341 Dec 25 08:38 uml.jpg
drwxr-xr-x  2 amrood amrood      4096 Feb 15  2006 univ

-rw-rw-r--  1 amrood amrood      5654 Aug  9  2007 yourfile.mid
-rw-rw-r--  1 amrood amrood    166255 Aug  9  2007 yourfile.swf

$
</pre>
<p>Here entries starting with <b>d.....</b> represent directories. For example, uml, univ and urlspedia are directories and rest of the entries are files.</p>
<h3>Who Are You?</h3>
<p>While you're logged into the system, you might be willing to know : <b>Who am I</b>?</p>
<p>The easiest way to find out "who you are" is to enter the <b>whoami</b> command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ whoami
 amrood

$
</pre>
<p>Try it on your system. This command lists the account name associated with the current login. You can try <b>who am i</b> command as well to get information about yourself.</p>
<h3>Who is Logged in?</h3>
<p>Sometime you might be interested to know who is logged in to the computer at the same time.</p>
<p>There are three commands available to get you this information, based on how much you wish to know about the other users: <b>users</b>, <b>who</b>, and <b>w</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ users
 amrood bablu qadir

$ who
amrood ttyp0 Oct 8 14:10 (limbo)
bablu  ttyp2 Oct 4 09:08 (calliope)
qadir  ttyp4 Oct 8 12:09 (dent)

$
</pre>
<p>Try the <b>w</b> command on your system to check the output. This lists down information associated with the users logged in the system.</p>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>When you finish your session, you need to log out of the system. This is to ensure that nobody else accesses your files.</p>
<p><b>To log out</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Just type the <b>logout</b> command at the command prompt, and the system will clean up everything and break the connection.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>System Shutdown</h3>
<p>The most consistent way to shut down a Unix system properly via the command line is to use one of the following commands &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Command &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>

<p><b>halt</b></p>
<p>Brings the system down immediately</p>
</td>

<p>You typically need to be the super user or root (the most privileged account on a Unix system) to shut down the system. However, on some standalone or personally-owned Unix boxes, an administrative user and sometimes regular users can do so.</p>
<h1>Unix - File Management</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about file management in Unix. All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.</p>
<p>When you work with Unix, one way or another, you spend most of your time working with files. This tutorial will help you understand how to create and remove files, copy and rename them, create links to them, etc.</p>
<p>In Unix, there are three basic types of files &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Ordinary Files</b> &minus; An ordinary file is a file on the system that contains data, text, or program instructions. In this tutorial, you look at working with ordinary files.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Directories</b> &minus; Directories store both special and ordinary files. For users familiar with Windows or Mac OS, Unix directories are equivalent to folders.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Special Files</b> &minus; Some special files provide access to hardware such as hard drives, CD-ROM drives, modems, and Ethernet adapters. Other special files are similar to aliases or shortcuts and enable you to access a single file using different names.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Listing Files</h2>
<p>To list the files and directories stored in the current directory, use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls
</pre>
<p>Here is the sample output of the above command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls

bin        hosts  lib     res.03
ch07       hw1    pub     test_results
ch07.bak   hw2    res.01  users
docs       hw3    res.02  work
</pre>
<p>The command <b>ls</b> supports the <b>-l</b> option which would help you to get more information about the listed files &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls -l

<p>Here is the information about all the listed columns &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>First Column</b> &minus; Represents the file type and the permission given on the file. Below is the description of all type of files.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Second Column</b> &minus; Represents the number of memory blocks taken by the file or directory.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Third Column</b> &minus; Represents the owner of the file. This is the Unix user who created this file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fourth Column</b> &minus; Represents the group of the owner. Every Unix user will have an associated group.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Sixth Column</b> &minus; Represents the date and the time when this file was created or modified for the last time.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Seventh Column</b> &minus; Represents the file or the directory name.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <b>ls -l</b> listing example, every file line begins with a <b>d</b>, <b>-</b>, or <b>l</b>. These characters indicate the type of the file that's listed.</p>

<h2>Metacharacters</h2>
<p>Metacharacters have a special meaning in Unix. For example, <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> are metacharacters. We use <b>*</b> to match 0 or more characters, a question mark (<b>?</b>) matches with a single character.</p>
<p>For Example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls ch*.doc
</pre>
<p>Displays all the files, the names of which start with <b>ch</b> and end with <b>.doc</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ch01-1.doc   ch010.doc  ch02.doc    ch03-2.doc 
ch04-1.doc   ch040.doc  ch05.doc    ch06-2.doc
ch01-2.doc ch02-1.doc c
</pre>
<p>Here, <b>*</b> works as meta character which matches with any character. If you want to display all the files ending with just <b>.doc</b>, then you can use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls *.doc
</pre>
<h2>Hidden Files</h2>
<p>An invisible file is one, the first character of which is the dot or the period character (.). Unix programs (including the shell) use most of these files to store configuration information.</p>
<p>Some common examples of the hidden files include the files &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>.profile</b> &minus; The Bourne shell ( sh) initialization script</p></li>
<li><p><b>.kshrc</b> &minus; The Korn shell ( ksh) initialization script</p></li>
<li><p><b>.cshrc</b> &minus; The C shell ( csh) initialization script</p></li>
<li><p><b>.rhosts</b> &minus; The remote shell configuration file</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To list the invisible files, specify the <b>-a</b> option to <b>ls</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ ls -a

.         .profile       docs     lib     test_results
..        .rhosts        hosts    pub     users
.emacs    bin            hw1      res.01  work
.exrc     ch07           hw2      res.02
.kshrc    ch07.bak       hw3      res.03
$
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Single dot (.)</b> &minus; This represents the current directory.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Double dot (..)</b> &minus; This represents the parent directory.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Files</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>vi</b> editor to create ordinary files on any Unix system. You simply need to give the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ vi filename
</pre>
<p>The above command will open a file with the given filename. Now, press the key <b>i</b> to come into the edit mode. Once you are in the edit mode, you can start writing your content in the file as in the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is unix file....I created it for the first time.....
I'm going to save this content in this file.
</pre>
<p>Once you are done with the program, follow these steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Press the key <b>esc</b> to come out of the edit mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Press two keys <b>Shift &plus; ZZ</b> together to come out of the file completely.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will now have a file created with <b>filename</b> in the current directory.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ vi filename
$
</pre>
<h2>Editing Files</h2>
<p>You can edit an existing file using the <b>vi</b> editor. We will discuss in short how to open an existing file &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ vi filename
</pre>
<p>Once the file is opened, you can come in the edit mode by pressing the key <b>i</b> and then you can proceed by editing the file. If you want to move here and there inside a file, then first you need to come out of the edit mode by pressing the key <b>Esc</b>. After this, you can use the following keys to move inside a file &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>l</b> key to move to the right side.</p></li>
<li><p><b>h</b> key to move to the left side.</p></li>
<li><p><b>k</b> key to move upside in the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>j</b> key to move downside in the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So using the above keys, you can position your cursor wherever you want to edit. Once you are positioned, then you can use the <b>i</b> key to come in the edit mode. Once you are done with the editing in your file, press <b>Esc</b> and finally two keys <b>Shift &plus; ZZ</b> together to come out of the file completely.</p>
<h2>Display Content of a File</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>cat</b> command to see the content of a file. Following is a simple example to see the content of the above created file &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat filename
This is unix file....I created it for the first time.....
I'm going to save this content in this file.
$
</pre>
<p>You can display the line numbers by using the <b>-b</b> option along with the <b>cat</b> command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat -b filename
1   This is unix file....I created it for the first time.....
2   I'm going to save this content in this file.
$
</pre>
<h2>Counting Words in a File</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>wc</b> command to get a count of the total number of lines, words, and characters contained in a file. Following is a simple example to see the information about the file created above &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ wc filename
2  19 103 filename
$
</pre>
<p>Here is the detail of all the four columns &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>First Column</b> &minus; Represents the total number of lines in the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Second Column</b> &minus; Represents the total number of words in the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Third Column</b> &minus; Represents the total number of bytes in the file. This is the actual size of the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fourth Column</b> &minus; Represents the file name.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can give multiple files and get information about those files at a time. Following is simple syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ wc filename1 filename2 filename3
</pre>
<h2>Copying Files</h2>
<p>To make a copy of a file use the <b>cp</b> command. The basic syntax of the command is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cp source_file destination_file
</pre>
<p>Following is the example to create a copy of the existing file <b>filename</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cp filename copyfile
$
</pre>
<p>You will now find one more file <b>copyfile</b> in your current directory. This file will exactly be the same as the original file <b>filename</b>.</p>
<h2>Renaming Files</h2>
<p>To change the name of a file, use the <b>mv</b> command. Following is the basic syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ mv old_file new_file
</pre>
<p>The following program will rename the existing file <b>filename</b> to <b>newfile</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ mv filename newfile
$
</pre>
<p>The <b>mv</b> command will move the existing file completely into the new file. In this case, you will find only <b>newfile</b> in your current directory.</p>
<h2>Deleting Files</h2>
<p>To delete an existing file, use the <b>rm</b> command. Following is the basic syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ rm filename
</pre>
<p><b>Caution</b> &minus; A file may contain useful information. It is always recommended to be careful while using this <b>Delete</b> command. It is better to use the <b>-i</b> option along with <b>rm</b> command.</p>
<p>Following is the example which shows how to completely remove the existing file <b>filename</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ rm filename
$
</pre>
<p>You can remove multiple files at a time with the command given below &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ rm filename1 filename2 filename3
$
</pre>
<h2>Standard Unix Streams</h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, every Unix program has three streams (files) opened for it when it starts up &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>stdin</b> &minus; This is referred to as the <i>standard input</i> and the associated file descriptor is 0. This is also represented as STDIN. The Unix program will read the default input from STDIN.</p></li>
<li><p><b>stdout</b> &minus; This is referred to as the <i>standard output</i> and the associated file descriptor is 1. This is also represented as STDOUT. The Unix program will write the default output at STDOUT</p></li>
<li><p><b>stderr</b> &minus; This is referred to as the <i>standard error</i> and the associated file descriptor is 2. This is also represented as STDERR. The Unix program will write all the error messages at STDERR.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Unix - Directory Management</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about directory management in Unix.</p>
<p>A directory is a file the solo job of which is to store the file names and the related information. All the files, whether ordinary, special, or directory, are contained in directories.</p>
<p>Unix uses a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories. This structure is often referred to as a directory tree. The tree has a single root node, the slash character (<b>/</b>), and all other directories are contained below it.</p>
<h2>Home Directory</h2>
<p>The directory in which you find yourself when you first login is called your home directory.</p>
<p>You will be doing much of your work in your home directory and subdirectories that you'll be creating to organize your files.</p>
<p>You can go in your home directory anytime using the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cd ~
$
</pre>
<p>Here <b>~</b> indicates the home directory. Suppose you have to go in any other user's home directory, use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cd ~username
$
</pre>
<p>To go in your last directory, you can use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cd -
$
</pre>
<h2>Absolute/Relative Pathnames</h2>
<p>Directories are arranged in a hierarchy with root (/) at the top. The position of any file within the hierarchy is described by its pathname.</p>
<p>Elements of a pathname are separated by a /. A pathname is absolute, if it is described in relation to root, thus absolute pathnames always begin with a /.</p>
<p>Following are some examples of absolute filenames.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
/etc/passwd
/users/sjones/chem/notes
/dev/rdsk/Os3
</pre>
<p>A pathname can also be relative to your current working directory. Relative pathnames never begin with /. Relative to user amrood's home directory, some pathnames might look like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
chem/notes
personal/res
</pre>
<p>To determine where you are within the filesystem hierarchy at any time, enter the command <b>pwd</b> to print the current working directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$pwd
/user0/home/amrood

$
</pre>
<h2>Listing Directories</h2>
<p>To list the files in a directory, you can use the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls dirname
</pre>
<p>Following is the example to list all the files contained in <b>/usr/local</b> directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls /usr/local

X11       bin          gimp       jikes       sbin
ace       doc          include    lib         share
atalk     etc          info       man         ami
</pre>
<h2>Creating Directories</h2>
<p>We will now understand how to create directories. Directories are created by the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mkdir dirname
</pre>
<p>Here, directory is the absolute or relative pathname of the directory you want to create. For example, the command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mkdir mydir
$
</pre>
<p>Creates the directory <b>mydir</b> in the current directory. Here is another example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mkdir /tmp/test-dir
$
</pre>
<p>This command creates the directory <b>test-dir</b> in the <b>/tmp</b> directory. The <b>mkdir</b> command produces no output if it successfully creates the requested directory.</p>
<p>If you give more than one directory on the command line, <b>mkdir</b> creates each of the directories. For example, &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mkdir docs pub
$
</pre>
<p>Creates the directories docs and pub under the current directory.</p>
<h2>Creating Parent Directories</h2>
<p>We will now understand how to create parent directories. Sometimes when you want to create a directory, its parent directory or directories might not exist. In this case, <b>mkdir</b> issues an error message as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mkdir /tmp/amrood/test
mkdir: Failed to make directory "/tmp/amrood/test"; 
No such file or directory
$
</pre>
<p>In such cases, you can specify the <b>-p</b> option to the <b>mkdir</b> command. It creates all the necessary directories for you. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mkdir -p /tmp/amrood/test
$
</pre>
<p>The above command creates all the required parent directories.</p>
<h2>Removing Directories</h2>
<p>Directories can be deleted using the <b>rmdir</b> command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$rmdir dirname
$
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; To remove a directory, make sure it is empty which means there should not be any file or sub-directory inside this directory.</p>
<p>You can remove multiple directories at a time as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$rmdir dirname1 dirname2 dirname3
$
</pre>
<p>The above command removes the directories dirname1, dirname2, and dirname3, if they are empty. The <b>rmdir</b> command produces no output if it is successful.</p>
<h2>Changing Directories</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>cd</b> command to do more than just change to a home directory. You can use it to change to any directory by specifying a valid absolute or relative path. The syntax is as given below &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cd dirname
$
</pre>
<p>Here, <b>dirname</b> is the name of the directory that you want to change to. For example, the command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cd /usr/local/bin
$
</pre>
<p>Changes to the directory <b>/usr/local/bin</b>. From this directory, you can <b>cd</b> to the directory <b>/usr/home/amrood</b> using the following relative path &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cd ../../home/amrood
$
</pre>
<h2>Renaming Directories</h2>
<p>The <b>mv (move)</b> command can also be used to rename a directory. The syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mv olddir newdir
$
</pre>
<p>You can rename a directory <b>mydir</b> to <b>yourdir</b> as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mv mydir yourdir
$
</pre>
<h2>The directories . (dot) and .. (dot dot)</h2>
<p>The <b>filename .</b> (dot) represents the current working directory; and the <b>filename ..</b> (dot dot) represents the directory one level above the current working directory, often referred to as the parent directory.</p>
<p>If we enter the command to show a listing of the current working directories/files and use the <b>-a option</b> to list all the files and the <b>-l option</b> to provide the long listing, we will receive the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls -la
drwxrwxr-x    4    teacher   class   2048  Jul 16 17.56 .

<h1>Unix - File Permission / Access Modes</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about file permission and access modes in Unix. File ownership is an important component of Unix that provides a secure method for storing files. Every file in Unix has the following attributes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Owner permissions</b> &minus; The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Group permissions</b> &minus; The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Other (world) permissions</b> &minus; The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Permission Indicators</h2>
<p>While using <b>ls -l</b> command, it displays various information related to file permission as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls -l /home/amrood
-rwxr-xr--  1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  myfile
drwxr-xr--- 1 amrood   users 1024  Nov 2 00:10  mydir
</pre>
<p>Here, the first column represents different access modes, i.e., the permission associated with a file or a directory.</p>
<p>The permissions are broken into groups of threes, and each position in the group denotes a specific permission, in this order: read (r), write (w), execute (x) &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The first three characters (2-4) represent the permissions for the file's owner. For example, <b>-rwxr-xr--</b> represents that the owner has read (r), write (w) and execute (x) permission.</p></li>
<li><p>The second group of three characters (5-7) consists of the permissions for the group to which the file belongs. For example, <b>-rwxr-xr--</b> represents that the group has read (r) and execute (x) permission, but no write permission.</p></li>
<li><p>The last group of three characters (8-10) represents the permissions for everyone else. For example, <b>-rwxr-xr--</b> represents that there is <b>read (r)</b> only permission.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>File Access Modes</h2>
<p>The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system. The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, and <b>execute</b> permissions, which have been described below &minus;</p>
<h3>Read</h3>
<p>Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.</p>
<h3>Write</h3>
<p>Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.</p>
<h3>Execute</h3>
<p>User with execute permissions can run a file as a program.</p>
<h2>Directory Access Modes</h2>
<p>Directory access modes are listed and organized in the same manner as any other file. There are a few differences that need to be mentioned &minus;</p>
<h3>Read</h3>
<p>Access to a directory means that the user can read the contents. The user can look at the <b>filenames</b> inside the directory.</p>
<h3>Write</h3>
<p>Access means that the user can add or delete files from the directory.</p>
<h3>Execute</h3>
<p>Executing a directory doesn't really make sense, so think of this as a traverse permission.</p>
<p>A user must have <b>execute</b> access to the <b>bin</b> directory in order to execute the <b>ls</b> or the <b>cd</b> command.</p>
<h2>Changing Permissions</h2>
<p>To change the file or the directory permissions, you use the <b>chmod</b> (change mode) command. There are two ways to use chmod — the symbolic mode and the absolute mode.</p>
<h3>Using chmod in Symbolic Mode</h3>
<p>The easiest way for a beginner to modify file or directory permissions is to use the symbolic mode. With symbolic permissions you can add, delete, or specify the permission set you want by using the operators in the following table.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Chmod operator &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>

<p><b>+</b></p>
<p>Adds the designated permission(s) to a file or directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>

<p><b>-</b></p>
<p>Removes the designated permission(s) from a file or directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<h2>Using chmod with Absolute Permissions</h2>
<p>The second way to modify permissions with the chmod command is to use a number to specify each set of permissions for the file.</p>
<p>Each permission is assigned a value, as the following table shows, and the total of each set of permissions provides a number for that set.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<h2>Changing Owners and Groups</h2>
<p>While creating an account on Unix, it assigns a <b>owner ID</b> and a <b>group ID</b> to each user. All the permissions mentioned above are also assigned based on the Owner and the Groups.</p>
<p>Two commands are available to change the owner and the group of files &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>chown</b> &minus; The <b>chown</b> command stands for <b>"change owner"</b> and is used to change the owner of a file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>chgrp</b> &minus; The <b>chgrp</b> command stands for <b>"change group"</b> and is used to change the group of a file.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Changing Ownership</h2>
<p>The <b>chown</b> command changes the ownership of a file. The basic syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ chown user filelist
</pre>
<p>The value of the user can be either the <b>name of a user</b> on the system or the <b>user id (uid)</b> of a user on the system.</p>
<p>The following example will help you understand the concept &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ chown amrood testfile
$
</pre>
<p>Changes the owner of the given file to the user <b>amrood</b>.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b> &minus; The super user, root, has the unrestricted capability to change the ownership of any file but normal users can change the ownership of only those files that they own.</p>
<h2>Changing Group Ownership</h2>
<p>The <b>chgrp</b> command changes the group ownership of a file. The basic syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ chgrp group filelist
</pre>
<p>The value of group can be the <b>name of a group</b> on the system or <b>the group ID (GID)</b> of a group on the system.</p>
<p>Following example helps you understand the concept &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ chgrp special testfile
$
</pre>
<p>Changes the group of the given file to <b>special</b> group.</p>
<h2>SUID and SGID File Permission</h2>
<p>Often when a command is executed, it will have to be executed with special privileges in order to accomplish its task.</p>
<p>As an example, when you change your password with the <b>passwd</b> command, your new password is stored in the file <b>/etc/shadow</b>.</p>
<p>As a regular user, you do not have <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> access to this file for security reasons, but when you change your password, you need to have the write permission to this file. This means that the <b>passwd</b> program has to give you additional permissions so that you can write to the file <b>/etc/shadow</b>.</p>
<p>Additional permissions are given to programs via a mechanism known as the <b>Set User ID (SUID)</b> and <b>Set Group ID (SGID)</b> bits.</p>
<p>When you execute a program that has the SUID bit enabled, you inherit the permissions of that program's owner. Programs that do not have the SUID bit set are run with the permissions of the user who started the program.</p>
<p>This is the case with SGID as well. Normally, programs execute with your group permissions, but instead your group will be changed just for this program to the group owner of the program.</p>
<p>The SUID and SGID bits will appear as the letter <b>"s"</b> if the permission is available. The SUID <b>"s"</b> bit will be located in the permission bits where the owners’ <b>execute</b> permission normally resides.</p>
<p>For example, the command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-r-sr-xr-x  1   root   bin  19031 Feb 7 13:47  /usr/bin/passwd*
$
</pre>
<p>Shows that the SUID bit is set and that the command is owned by the root. A capital letter <b>S</b> in the execute position instead of a lowercase <b>s</b> indicates that the execute bit is not set.</p>
<p>If the sticky bit is enabled on the directory, files can only be removed if you are one of the following users &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The owner of the sticky directory</li>
<li>The owner of the file being removed</li>
<li>The super user, root</li>
</ul>
<p>To set the SUID and SGID bits for any directory try the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ chmod ug+s dirname
$ ls -l
drwsr-sr-x 2 root root  4096 Jun 19 06:45 dirname
$
</pre>
<h1>Unix - Environment</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the Unix environment. An important Unix concept is the <b>environment</b>, which is defined by environment variables. Some are set by the system, others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program.</p>
<p>A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.</p>
<p>For example, first we set a variable TEST and then we access its value using the <b>echo</b> command &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
$TEST="Unix Programming"
$echo $TEST
</pre>
<p>It produces the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Unix Programming
</pre>
<p>Note that the environment variables are set without using the <b>$</b> sign but while accessing them we use the $ sign as prefix. These variables retain their values until we come out of the shell.</p>
<p>When you log in to the system, the shell undergoes a phase called <b>initialization</b> to set up the environment. This is usually a two-step process that involves the shell reading the following files &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>/etc/profile</li>
<li>profile</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The shell checks to see whether the file <b>/etc/profile</b> exists.</p></li>
<li><p>If it exists, the shell reads it. Otherwise, this file is skipped. No error message is displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>The shell checks to see whether the file <b>.profile</b> exists in your home directory. Your home directory is the directory that you start out in after you log in.</p></li>
<li><p>If it exists, the shell reads it; otherwise, the shell skips it. No error message is displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as both of these files have been read, the shell displays a prompt &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$
</pre>
<p>This is the prompt where you can enter commands in order to have them executed.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The shell initialization process detailed here applies to all <b>Bourne</b> type shells, but some additional files are used by <b>bash</b> and <b>ksh</b>.</p>
<h2>The .profile File</h2>
<p>The file <b>/etc/profile</b> is maintained by the system administrator of your Unix machine and contains shell initialization information required by all users on a system.</p>
<p>The file <b>.profile</b> is under your control. You can add as much shell customization information as you want to this file. The minimum set of information that you need to configure includes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The type of terminal you are using.</li>
<li>A list of directories in which to locate the commands.</li>
<li>A list of variables affecting the look and feel of your terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check your <b>.profile</b> available in your home directory. Open it using the vi editor and check all the variables set for your environment.</p>
<h2>Setting the Terminal Type</h2>
<p>Usually, the type of terminal you are using is automatically configured by either the <b>login</b> or <b>getty</b> programs. Sometimes, the auto configuration process guesses your terminal incorrectly.</p>
<p>If your terminal is set incorrectly, the output of the commands might look strange, or you might not be able to interact with the shell properly.</p>
<p>To make sure that this is not the case, most users set their terminal to the lowest common denominator in the following way &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$TERM=vt100
$
</pre>
<h2>Setting the PATH</h2>
<p>When you type any command on the command prompt, the shell has to locate the command before it can be executed.</p>
<p>The PATH variable specifies the locations in which the shell should look for commands. Usually the Path variable is set as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$PATH = /bin:/usr/bin
$
</pre>
<p>Here, each of the individual entries separated by the colon character <b>(:)</b> are directories. If you request the shell to execute a command and it cannot find it in any of the directories given in the PATH variable, a message similar to the following appears &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$hello
hello: not found
$
</pre>
<p>There are variables like PS1 and PS2 which are discussed in the next section.</p>
<h2>PS1 and PS2 Variables</h2>
<p>The characters that the shell displays as your command prompt are stored in the variable PS1. You can change this variable to be anything you want. As soon as you change it, it'll be used by the shell from that point on.</p>
<p>For example, if you issued the command &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$PS1='=&gt;'
=&gt;
=&gt;
=&gt;
</pre>
<p>Your prompt will become =&gt;. To set the value of <b>PS1</b> so that it shows the working directory, issue the command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
=&gt;PS1="[\u@\h \w]\$"
[root@ip-72-167-112-17 /var/www/tutorialspoint/unix]$
[root@ip-72-167-112-17 /var/www/tutorialspoint/unix]$
</pre>
<p>The result of this command is that the prompt displays the user's username, the machine's name (hostname), and the working directory.</p>
<p>There are quite a few <b>escape sequences</b> that can be used as value arguments for PS1; try to limit yourself to the most critical so that the prompt does not overwhelm you with information.</p>

</table>
<p>You can make the change yourself every time you log in, or you can have the change made automatically in PS1 by adding it to your <b>.profile</b> file.</p>
<p>When you issue a command that is incomplete, the shell will display a secondary prompt and wait for you to complete the command and hit <b>Enter</b> again.</p>
<p>The default secondary prompt is <b>&gt;</b> (the greater than sign), but can be changed by re-defining the <b>PS2</b> shell variable &minus;</p>
<p>Following is the example which uses the default secondary prompt &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

<h1>Unix Basic Utilities - Printing, Email</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about Printing and Email as the basic utilities of Unix. So far, we have tried to understand the Unix OS and the nature of its basic commands. In this chapter, we will learn some important Unix utilities that can be used in our day-to-day life.</p>
<h2>Printing Files</h2>
<p>Before you print a file on a Unix system, you may want to reformat it to adjust the margins, highlight some words, and so on. Most files can also be printed without reformatting, but the raw printout may not be that appealing.</p>
<p>Many versions of Unix include two powerful text formatters, <b>nroff</b> and <b>troff</b>.</p> 
<h3>The pr Command</h3>
<p>The <b>pr</b> command does minor formatting of files on the terminal screen or for a printer. For example, if you have a long list of names in a file, you can format it onscreen into two or more columns.</p>
<p>Following is the syntax for the <b>pr</b> command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
pr option(s) filename(s)
</pre>
<p>The <b>pr</b> changes the format of the file only on the screen or on the printed copy; it doesn't modify the original file. Following table lists some <b>pr</b> options &minus;</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>
<p><b>-d</b></p>
<p>Double-spaces the output (not on all <b>pr</b> versions)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>-h "header"</b></p>
<p>Takes the next item as a report header</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><b>-t</b></p>
<p>Eliminates the printing of header and the top/bottom margins</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>-l PAGE_LENGTH</b></p>
<p>Sets the page length to PAGE_LENGTH (66) lines. The default number of lines of text is 56</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td>
<p><b>-o MARGIN</b></p>
<p>Offsets each line with MARGIN (zero) spaces</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">7</td>
<td>
<p><b>-w PAGE_WIDTH</b></p>
<p>Sets the page width to PAGE_WIDTH (72) characters for multiple text-column output only</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Before using <b>pr</b>, here are the contents of a sample file named food.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h3>The lp and lpr Commands</h3>
<p>The command <b>lp</b> or <b>lpr</b> prints a file onto paper as opposed to the screen display. Once you are ready with formatting using the <b>pr</b> command, you can use any of these commands to print your file on the printer connected to your computer.</p>
<p>Your system administrator has probably set up a default printer at your site. To print a file named <b>food</b> on the default printer, use the <b>lp</b> or <b>lpr</b> command, as in the following example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$lp food
request id is laserp-525  (1 file)
$
</pre>
<p>The <b>lp</b> command shows an ID that you can use to cancel the print job or check its status.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If you are using the <b>lp</b> command, you can use the -n<b>Num</b> option to print Num number of copies. Along with the command <b>lpr</b>, you can use -<b>Num</b> for the same.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are multiple printers connected with the shared network, then you can choose a printer using -d<b>printer</b> option along with lp command and for the same purpose you can use -P<b>printer</b> option along with lpr command. Here printer is the printer name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>The lpstat and lpq Commands</h3>
<p>The <b>lpstat</b> command shows what's in the printer queue: request IDs, owners, file sizes, when the jobs were sent for printing, and the status of the requests.</p>
<p>Use <b>lpstat -o</b> if you want to see all output requests other than just your own. Requests are shown in the order they'll be printed &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$lpstat -o
laserp-573  john  128865  Nov 7  11:27  on laserp
laserp-574  grace  82744  Nov 7  11:28
laserp-575  john   23347  Nov 7  11:35
$
</pre>
<p>The <b>lpq</b> gives slightly different information than <b>lpstat -o</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$lpq

2nd    john       575  standard input         23347 bytes
$
</pre>
<p>Here the first line displays the printer status. If the printer is disabled or running out of paper, you may see different messages on this first line.</p>
<h3>The cancel and lprm Commands</h3>
<p>The <b>cancel</b> command terminates a printing request from the <b>lp command</b>. The <b>lprm</b> command terminates all <b>lpr requests</b>. You can specify either the ID of the request (displayed by lp or lpq) or the name of the printer.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cancel laserp-575
request "laserp-575" cancelled
$
</pre>
<p>To cancel whatever request is currently printing, regardless of its ID, simply enter cancel and the printer name &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$cancel laserp
request "laserp-573" cancelled
$
</pre>
<p>The <b>lprm</b> command will cancel the active job if it belongs to you. Otherwise, you can give job numbers as arguments, or use a <b>dash (-)</b> to remove all of your jobs &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$lprm 575
dfA575diamond dequeued
cfA575diamond dequeued
$
</pre>
<p>The <b>lprm</b> command tells you the actual filenames removed from the printer queue.</p>
<h2>Sending Email</h2>
<p>You use the Unix mail command to send and receive mail. Here is the syntax to send an email &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$mail [-s subject] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc-addr] to-addr

<h1>Unix - Pipes and Filters</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about pipes and filters in Unix. You can connect two commands together so that the output from one program becomes the input of the next program. Two or more commands connected in this way form a pipe.</p>
<p>To make a pipe, put a vertical bar (<b>&verbar;</b>) on the command line between two commands.</p>
<p>When a program takes its input from another program, it performs some operation on that input, and writes the result to the standard output. It is referred to as a <b><i>filter</i></b>.</p>
<h2>The grep Command</h2>
<p>The grep command searches a file or files for lines that have a certain pattern. The syntax is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$grep pattern file(s)
</pre>
<p>The name <b>"grep"</b> comes from the ed (a Unix line editor) command <b>g/re/p</b> which means “globally search for a regular expression and print all lines containing it”.</p>
<p>A regular expression is either some plain text (a word, for example) and/or special characters used for pattern matching.</p>
<p>The simplest use of grep is to look for a pattern consisting of a single word. It can be used in a pipe so that only those lines of the input files containing a given string are sent to the standard output. If you don't give grep a filename to read, it reads its standard input; that's the way all filter programs work &minus;</p>

<h1>Unix - Processes Management</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about process management in Unix. When you execute a program on your Unix system, the system creates a special environment for that program. This environment contains everything needed for the system to run the program as if no other program were running on the system.</p>
<p>Whenever you issue a command in Unix, it creates, or starts, a new process. When you tried out the <b>ls</b> command to list the directory contents, you started a process. A process, in simple terms, is an instance of a running program.</p>
<p>The operating system tracks processes through a five-digit ID number known as the <b>pid</b> or the <b>process ID</b>. Each process in the system has a unique <b>pid</b>.</p>
<p>Pids eventually repeat because all the possible numbers are used up and the next pid rolls or starts over. At any point of time, no two processes with the same pid exist in the system because it is the pid that Unix uses to track each process.</p>
<h2>Starting a Process</h2>
<p>When you start a process (run a command), there are two ways you can run it &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Foreground Processes</li>
<li>Background Processes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foreground Processes</h3>
<p>By default, every process that you start runs in the foreground. It gets its input from the keyboard and sends its output to the screen.</p>
<p>You can see this happen with the <b>ls</b> command. If you wish to list all the files in your current directory, you can use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls ch*.doc
</pre>
<p>This would display all the files, the names of which start with <b>ch</b> and end with <b>.doc</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ch01-1.doc   ch010.doc  ch02.doc    ch03-2.doc 
ch04-1.doc   ch040.doc  ch05.doc    ch06-2.doc
ch01-2.doc   ch02-1.doc
</pre>
<p>The process runs in the foreground, the output is directed to my screen, and if the <b>ls</b> command wants any input (which it does not), it waits for it from the keyboard.</p>
<p>While a program is running in the foreground and is time-consuming, no other commands can be run (start any other processes) because the prompt would not be available until the program finishes processing and comes out.</p>
<h3>Background Processes</h3>
<p>A background process runs without being connected to your keyboard. If the background process requires any keyboard input, it waits.</p>
<p>The advantage of running a process in the background is that you can run other commands; you do not have to wait until it completes to start another!</p>
<p>The simplest way to start a background process is to add an ampersand (<b>&amp;</b>) at the end of the command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ls ch*.doc &amp;
</pre>
<p>This displays all those files the names of which start with <b>ch</b> and end with <b>.doc</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ch01-1.doc   ch010.doc  ch02.doc    ch03-2.doc 
ch04-1.doc   ch040.doc  ch05.doc    ch06-2.doc
ch01-2.doc   ch02-1.doc
</pre>
<p>Here, if the <b>ls</b> command wants any input (which it does not), it goes into a stop state until we move it into the foreground and give it the data from the keyboard.</p>
<p>That first line contains information about the background process - the job number and the process ID. You need to know the job number to manipulate it between the background and the foreground.</p>
<p>Press the Enter key and you will see the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1]   +   Done                 ls ch*.doc &amp;
$
</pre>
<p>The first line tells you that the <b>ls</b> command background process finishes successfully. The second is a prompt for another command.</p>
<h2>Listing Running Processes</h2>
<p>It is easy to see your own processes by running the <b>ps</b> (process status) command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ps
PID       TTY      TIME        CMD
18358     ttyp3    00:00:00    sh

18789     ttyp3    00:00:00    ps
</pre>
<p>One of the most commonly used flags for ps is the <b>-f</b> ( f for full) option, which provides more information as shown in the following example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h2>Stopping Processes</h2>
<p>Ending a process can be done in several different ways. Often, from a console-based command, sending a CTRL &plus; C keystroke (the default interrupt character) will exit the command. This works when the process is running in the foreground mode.</p>
<p>If a process is running in the background, you should get its Job ID using the <b>ps</b> command. After that, you can use the <b>kill</b> command to kill the process as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ps -f
UID      PID  PPID C STIME    TTY   TIME CMD
amrood   6738 3662 0 10:23:03 pts/6 0:00 first_one

$kill 6738
Terminated
</pre>
<p>Here, the <b>kill</b> command terminates the <b>first_one</b> process. If a process ignores a regular kill command, you can use <b>kill -9</b> followed by the process ID as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$kill -9 6738
Terminated
</pre>
<h2>Parent and Child Processes</h2>
<p>Each unix process has two ID numbers assigned to it: The Process ID (pid) and the Parent process ID (ppid). Each user process in the system has a parent process.</p>
<p>Most of the commands that you run have the shell as their parent. Check the <b>ps -f</b> example where this command listed both the process ID and the parent process ID.</p>
<h2>Zombie and Orphan Processes</h2>
<p>Normally, when a child process is killed, the parent process is updated via a <b>SIGCHLD</b> signal. Then the parent can do some other task or restart a new child as needed. However, sometimes the parent process is killed before its child is killed. In this case, the "parent of all processes," the <b>init</b> process, becomes the new PPID (parent process ID). In some cases, these processes are called orphan processes.</p>
<p>When a process is killed, a <b>ps</b> listing may still show the process with a <b>Z</b> state. This is a zombie or defunct process. The process is dead and not being used. These processes are different from the orphan processes. They have completed execution but still find an entry in the process table.</p>
<h2>Daemon Processes</h2>
<p>Daemons are system-related background processes that often run with the permissions of root and services requests from other processes.</p>
<p>A daemon has no controlling terminal. It cannot open <b>/dev/tty</b>. If you do a <b>"ps -ef"</b> and look at the <b>tty</b> field, all daemons will have a <b>?</b> for the <b>tty</b>.</p>
<p>To be precise, a daemon is a process that runs in the background, usually waiting for something to happen that it is capable of working with. For example, a printer daemon waiting for print commands.</p>
<p>If you have a program that calls for lengthy processing, then it’s worth to make it a daemon and run it in the background.</p>
<h2>The top Command</h2>
<p>The <b>top</b> command is a very useful tool for quickly showing processes sorted by various criteria.</p>
<p>It is an interactive diagnostic tool that updates frequently and shows information about physical and virtual memory, CPU usage, load averages, and your busy processes.</p>
<p>Here is the simple syntax to run top command and to see the statistics of CPU utilization by different processes &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$top
</pre>
<h2>Job ID Versus Process ID</h2>
<p>Background and suspended processes are usually manipulated via <b>job number (job ID)</b>. This number is different from the process ID and is used because it is shorter.</p>
<p>In addition, a job can consist of multiple processes running in a series or at the same time, in parallel. Using the job ID is easier than tracking individual processes.</p>
<h1>Unix - Network Communication Utilities</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about network communication utilities in Unix. When you work in a distributed environment, you need to communicate with remote users and you also need to access remote Unix machines.</p>
<p>There are several Unix utilities that help users compute in a networked, distributed environment. This chapter lists a few of them.</p>
<h2>The ping Utility</h2>
<p>The <b>ping</b> command sends an echo request to a host available on the network. Using this command, you can check if your remote host is responding well or not.</p>
<p>The ping command is useful for the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Tracking and isolating hardware and software problems.</li>
<li>Determining the status of the network and various foreign hosts.</li>
<li>Testing, measuring, and managing networks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Following is the simple syntax to use the ping command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>Unix - The vi Editor Tutorial</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will understand how the vi Editor works in Unix. There are many ways to edit files in Unix. Editing files using the screen-oriented text editor <b>vi</b> is one of the best ways. This editor enables you to edit lines in context with other lines in the file.</p>
<p>An improved version of the vi editor which is called the <b>VIM</b> has also been made available now. Here, VIM stands for <b>Vi IM</b>proved.</p>
<p>vi is generally considered the de facto standard in Unix editors because &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It's usually available on all the flavors of Unix system.</p></li>
<li><p>Its implementations are very similar across the board.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires very few resources.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more user-friendly than other editors such as the <b>ed</b> or the <b>ex</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the <b>vi</b> editor to edit an existing file or to create a new file from scratch. You can also use this editor to just read a text file.</p>
<h2>Starting the vi Editor</h2>
<p>The following table lists out the basic commands to use the vi editor &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Command &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>vi filename</b></p>
<p>Creates a new file if it already does not exist, otherwise opens an existing file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>vi -R filename</b></p>
<p>Opens an existing file in the read-only mode.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>view filename</b></p>
<p>Opens an existing file in the read-only mode.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Following is an example to create a new file <b>testfile</b> if it already does not exist in the current working directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$vi testfile
</pre>
<p>The above command will generate the following output &minus;</p>

</pre>
<p>You will notice a <b>tilde</b> (~) on each line following the cursor. A tilde represents an unused line. If a line does not begin with a tilde and appears to be blank, there is a space, tab, newline, or some other non-viewable character present.</p>
<p>You now have one open file to start working on. Before proceeding further, let us understand a few important concepts.</p>
<h2>Operation Modes</h2>
<p>While working with the vi editor, we usually come across the following two modes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Command mode</b> &minus; This mode enables you to perform administrative tasks such as saving the files, executing the commands, moving the cursor, cutting (yanking) and pasting the lines or words, as well as finding and replacing. In this mode, whatever you type is interpreted as a command.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Insert mode</b> &minus; This mode enables you to insert text into the file. Everything that's typed in this mode is interpreted as input and placed in the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>vi always starts in the <b>command mode</b>. To enter text, you must be in the insert mode for which simply type <b>i</b>. To come out of the insert mode, press the <b>Esc</b> key, which will take you back to the command mode.</p>
<p><b>Hint</b> &minus; If you are not sure which mode you are in, press the Esc key twice; this will take you to the command mode. You open a file using the vi editor. Start by typing some characters and then come to the command mode to understand the difference.</p>
<h2>Getting Out of vi</h2>
<p>The command to quit out of vi is <b>:q</b>. Once in the command mode, type colon, and 'q', followed by return. If your file has been modified in any way, the editor will warn you of this, and not let you quit. To ignore this message, the command to quit out of vi without saving is <b>:q!</b>. This lets you exit vi without saving any of the changes.</p>
<p>The command to save the contents of the editor is <b>:w</b>. You can combine the above command with the quit command, or use <b>:wq</b> and return.</p>
<p>The easiest way to <b>save your changes and exit vi</b> is with the </b>ZZ</b> command. When you are in the command mode, type <b>ZZ</b>. The <b>ZZ</b> command works the same way as the <b>:wq</b> command.</p>
<p>If you want to specify/state any particular name for the file, you can do so by specifying it after the <b>:w</b>. For example, if you wanted to save the file you were working on as another filename called <b>filename2</b>, you would type <b>:w filename2</b> and return.</p>
<h2>Moving within a File</h2>
<p>To move around within a file without affecting your text, you must be in the command mode (press Esc twice). The following table lists out a few commands you can use to move around one character at a time &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;%">S.No.</th>

<p>The following points need to be considered to move within a file &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>vi is case-sensitive. You need to pay attention to capitalization when using the commands.</p></li>
<li><p>Most commands in vi can be prefaced by the number of times you want the action to occur. For example, <b>2j</b> moves the cursor two lines down the cursor location.</p></li>

<h2>Word and Character Searching</h2>
<p>The vi editor has two kinds of searches: <b>string</b> and <b>character</b>. For a string search, the <b>/</b> and <b>?</b> commands are used. When you start these commands, the command just typed will be shown on the last line of the screen, where you type the particular string to look for.</p>
<p>These two commands differ only in the direction where the search takes place &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>/</b> command searches forwards (downwards) in the file.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>?</b> command searches backwards (upwards) in the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>n</b> and <b>N</b> commands repeat the previous search command in the same or the opposite direction, respectively. Some characters have special meanings. These characters must be preceded by a backslash (<b>\</b>) to be included as part of the search expression.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Character &amp;Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>^</b></p>
<p>Searches at the beginning of the line (Use at the beginning of a search expression).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>.</b></p>
<p>Matches a single character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>Matches zero or more of the previous character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>

<p><b>$</b></p>
<p>End of the line (Use at the end of the search expression).</p>
</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">7</td>
<td>
<p><b>&gt;</b></p>
<p>This helps see the '<b>&lt;</b>' character description above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The character search searches within one line to find a character entered after the command. The <b>f</b> and <b>F</b> commands search for a character on the current line only. <b>f</b> searches forwards and <b>F</b> searches backwards and the cursor moves to the position of the found character.</p>
<p>The <b>t</b> and <b>T</b> commands search for a character on the current line only, but for <b>t</b>, the cursor moves to the position before the character, and <b>T</b> searches the line backwards to the position after the character.</p>
<h2>Set Commands</h2>
<p>You can change the look and feel of your vi screen using the following <b>:set</b> commands. Once you are in the command mode, type <b>:set</b> followed by any of the following commands.</p>

<h2>Running Commands</h2>
<p>The vi has the capability to run commands from within the editor. To run a command, you only need to go to the command mode and type <b>:!</b> command.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to check whether a file exists before you try to save your file with that filename, you can type <b>:! ls</b> and you will see the output of <b>ls</b> on the screen.</p>
<p>You can press any key (or the command's escape sequence) to return to your vi session.</p>
<h2>Replacing Text</h2>
<p>The substitution command (<b>:s/</b>) enables you to quickly replace words or groups of words within your files. Following is the syntax to replace text &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
:s/search/replace/g
</pre>
<p>The <b>g</b> stands for globally. The result of this command is that all occurrences on the cursor's line are changed.</p>
<h2>Important Points to Note</h2>
<p>The following points will add to your success with vi &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You must be in command mode to use the commands. (Press Esc twice at any time to ensure that you are in command mode.)</p></li>
<li><p>You must be careful with the commands. These are case-sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>You must be in insert mode to enter text.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Unix - What is Shells?</h1>
<p>A <b>Shell</b> provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.</p>
<p>Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.</p>
<h2>Shell Prompt</h2>
<p>The prompt, <b>$</b>, which is called the <b>command prompt</b>, is issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.</p>
<p>Shell reads your input after you press <b>Enter</b>. It determines the command you want executed by looking at the first word of your input. A word is an unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs separate words.</p>
<p>Following is a simple example of the <b>date</b> command, which displays the current date and time &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$date
Thu Jun 25 08:30:19 MST 2009
</pre>
<p>You can customize your command prompt using the environment variable PS1 explained in the Environment tutorial.</p>
<h2>Shell Types</h2>
<p>In Unix, there are two major types of shells &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Bourne shell</b> &minus; If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the <b>$</b> character is the default prompt.</p></li>
<li><p><b>C shell</b> &minus; If you are using a C-type shell, the % character is the default prompt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Bourne Shell has the following subcategories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Bourne shell (sh)</li>
<li>Korn shell (ksh)</li>
<li>Bourne Again shell (bash)</li>
<li>POSIX shell (sh)</li>
</ul>
<p>The different C-type shells follow &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>C shell (csh)</li>
<li>TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)</li>
</ul>
<p>The original Unix shell was written in the mid-1970s by Stephen R. Bourne while he was at the AT&amp;T Bell Labs in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Bourne shell was the first shell to appear on Unix systems, thus it is referred to as "the shell".</p>
<p>Bourne shell is usually installed as <b>/bin/sh</b> on most versions of Unix. For this reason, it is the shell of choice for writing scripts that can be used on different versions of Unix.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover most of the Shell concepts that are based on the Borne Shell.</p>
<h2>Shell Scripts</h2>
<p>The basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands, which are listed in the order of execution. A good shell script will have comments, preceded by <b>#</b> sign, describing the steps.</p>
<p>There are conditional tests, such as value A is greater than value B, loops allowing us to go through massive amounts of data, files to read and store data, and variables to read and store data, and the script may include functions.</p>
<p>We are going to write many scripts in the next sections. It would be a simple text file in which we would put all our commands and several other required constructs that tell the shell environment what to do and when to do it.</p>
<p>Shell scripts and functions are both interpreted. This means they are not compiled.</p>
<h2>Example Script</h2>
<p>Assume we create a <b>test.sh</b> script. Note all the scripts would have the <b>.sh</b> extension. Before you add anything else to your script, you need to alert the system that a shell script is being started. This is done using the <b>shebang</b> construct. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
#!/bin/sh
</pre>
<p>This tells the system that the commands that follow are to be executed by the Bourne shell. <i>It's called a shebang because the <b>#</b> symbol is called a hash, and the ! symbol is called a bang</i>.</p>
<p>To create a script containing these commands, you put the shebang line first and then add the commands &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
#!/bin/bash
pwd
ls
</pre>
<h2>Shell Comments</h2>
<p>You can put your comments in your script as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
#!/bin/bash

# Author : Zara Ali
# Copyright (c) Tutorialspoint.com
# Script follows here:
pwd
ls
</pre>
<p>Save the above content and make the script executable &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$chmod +x test.sh
</pre>
<p>The shell script is now ready to be executed &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
/home/amrood
index.htm  unix-basic_utilities.htm  unix-directories.htm  
test.sh    unix-communication.htm    unix-environment.htm
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; To execute a program available in the current directory, use <b>./program_name</b></p>
<h2>Extended Shell Scripts</h2>
<p>Shell scripts have several required constructs that tell the shell environment what to do and when to do it. Of course, most scripts are more complex than the above one.</p>
<p>The shell is, after all, a real programming language, complete with variables, control structures, and so forth. No matter how complicated a script gets, it is still just a list of commands executed sequentially.</p>
<p>The following script uses the <b>read</b> command which takes the input from the keyboard and assigns it as the value of the variable PERSON and finally prints it on STDOUT.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

# Author : Zara Ali
# Copyright (c) Tutorialspoint.com
# Script follows here:

echo "What is your name?"
read PERSON
echo "Hello, $PERSON"
</pre>
<p>Here is a sample run of the script &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
What is your name?
Zara Ali
Hello, Zara Ali
$
</pre>
<h1>Unix - Using Shell Variables</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn how to use Shell variables in Unix. A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.</p>
<p>A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data. The shell enables you to create, assign, and delete variables.</p>
<h2>Variable Names</h2>
<p>The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _).</p>
<p>By convention, Unix shell variables will have their names in UPPERCASE.</p>
<p>The following examples are valid variable names &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
_ALI
TOKEN_A
VAR_1
VAR_2
</pre>
<p>Following are the examples of invalid variable names &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
2_VAR
-VARIABLE
VAR1-VAR2
VAR_A!
</pre>
<p>The reason you cannot use other characters such as <b>!</b>, <b>*</b>, or <b>-</b> is that these characters have a special meaning for the shell.</p>
<h2>Defining Variables</h2>
<p>Variables are defined as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
variable_name=variable_value
</pre>
<p>For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
NAME="Zara Ali"
</pre>
<p>The above example defines the variable NAME and assigns the value "Zara Ali" to it. Variables of this type are called <b>scalar variables</b>. A scalar variable can hold only one value at a time.</p>
<p>Shell enables you to store any value you want in a variable. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
VAR1="Zara Ali"
VAR2=100
</pre>
<h2>Accessing Values</h2>
<p>To access the value stored in a variable, prefix its name with the dollar sign (<b>$</b>) &minus;</p>
<p>For example, the following script will access the value of defined variable NAME and print it on STDOUT &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Zara Ali"
echo $NAME
</pre>
<p>The above script will produce the following value &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Zara Ali
</pre>
<h2>Read-only Variables</h2>
<p>Shell provides a way to mark variables as read-only by using the read-only command. After a variable is marked read-only, its value cannot be changed.</p>
<p>For example, the following script generates an error while trying to change the value of NAME &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Zara Ali"
readonly NAME
NAME="Qadiri"
</pre>
<p>The above script will generate the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
/bin/sh: NAME: This variable is read only.
</pre>
<h2>Unsetting Variables</h2>
<p>Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks. Once you unset a variable, you cannot access the stored value in the variable.</p>
<p>Following is the syntax to unset a defined variable using the <b>unset</b> command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
unset variable_name
</pre>
<p>The above command unsets the value of a defined variable. Here is a simple example that demonstrates how the command works &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Zara Ali"
unset NAME
echo $NAME
</pre>
<p>The above example does not print anything. You cannot use the unset command to <b>unset</b> variables that are marked <b>readonly</b>.</p>
<h2>Variable Types</h2>
<p>When a shell is running, three main types of variables are present &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Local Variables</b> &minus; A local variable is a variable that is present within the current instance of the shell. It is not available to programs that are started by the shell. They are set at the command prompt.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Environment Variables</b> &minus; An environment variable is available to any child process of the shell. Some programs need environment variables in order to function correctly. Usually, a shell script defines only those environment variables that are needed by the programs that it runs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Shell Variables</b> &minus; A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly. Some of these variables are environment variables whereas others are local variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Unix - Special Variables</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about special variable in Unix. In one of our previous chapters, we understood how to be careful when we use certain nonalphanumeric characters in variable names. This is because those characters are used in the names of special Unix variables. These variables are reserved for specific functions.</p>
<p>For example, the <b>$</b> character represents the process ID number, or PID, of the current shell &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
$echo $$
<p></p>
</pre>
<p>The above command writes the PID of the current shell &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
29949
</pre>
<p>The following table shows a number of special variables that you can use in your shell scripts &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Variable &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>$0</b></p>
<p>The filename of the current script.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>$n</b></p>
<p>These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here <b>n</b> is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is $1, the second argument is $2, and so on).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>$#</b></p>
<p>The number of arguments supplied to a script.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p>All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>$@</b></p>
<p>All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td>
<p><b>$?</b></p>
<p>The exit status of the last command executed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">7</td>

<p><b>$$</b></p>
<p>The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">8</td>
<td>
<p><b>$!</b></p>
<p>The process number of the last background command.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Command-Line Arguments</h2>
<p>The command-line arguments $1, $2, $3, ...$9 are positional parameters, with $0 pointing to the actual command, program, shell script, or function and $1, $2, $3, ...$9 as the arguments to the command.</p>
<p>Following script uses various special variables related to the command line &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

echo "File Name: $0"
echo "First Parameter : $1"
echo "Second Parameter : $2"
echo "Quoted Values: $@"
echo "Quoted Values: $*"
echo "Total Number of Parameters : $#"
</pre>
<p>Here is a sample run for the above script &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh Zara Ali
File Name : ./test.sh
First Parameter : Zara
Second Parameter : Ali
Quoted Values: Zara Ali
Quoted Values: Zara Ali
Total Number of Parameters : 2
</pre>
<h2>Special Parameters $* and $@</h2>
<p>There are special parameters that allow accessing all the command-line arguments at once. <b>$*</b> and <b>$@</b> both will act the same unless they are enclosed in double quotes, <b>""</b>.</p>
<p>Both the parameters specify the command-line arguments. However, the "$*" special parameter takes the entire list as one argument with spaces between and the "$@" special parameter takes the entire list and separates it into separate arguments.</p>
<p>We can write the shell script as shown below to process an unknown number of commandline arguments with either the $* or $@ special parameters &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

for TOKEN in $*
do
   echo $TOKEN
done
</pre>
<p>Here is a sample run for the above script &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh Zara Ali 10 Years Old
Zara
Ali
10
Years
Old
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Here <b>do...done</b> is a kind of loop that will be covered in a subsequent tutorial.</p>
<h2>Exit Status</h2>
<p>The <b>$?</b> variable represents the exit status of the previous command.</p>
<p>Exit status is a numerical value returned by every command upon its completion. As a rule, most commands return an exit status of 0 if they were successful, and 1 if they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Some commands return additional exit statuses for particular reasons. For example, some commands differentiate between kinds of errors and will return various exit values depending on the specific type of failure.</p>
<p>Following is the example of successful command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh Zara Ali
File Name : ./test.sh
First Parameter : Zara
Second Parameter : Ali
Quoted Values: Zara Ali
Quoted Values: Zara Ali
Total Number of Parameters : 2
$echo $?

<h1>Unix - Using Shell Arrays</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to use shell arrays in Unix. A shell variable is capable enough to hold a single value. These variables are called scalar variables.</p>
<p>Shell supports a different type of variable called an <b>array variable</b>. This can hold multiple values at the same time. Arrays provide a method of grouping a set of variables. Instead of creating a new name for each variable that is required, you can use a single array variable that stores all the other variables.</p>
<p>All the naming rules discussed for Shell Variables would be applicable while naming arrays.</p>
<h2>Defining Array Values</h2>
<p>The difference between an array variable and a scalar variable can be explained as follows.</p>
<p>Suppose you are trying to represent the names of various students as a set of variables. Each of the individual variables is a scalar variable as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
NAME01="Zara"
NAME02="Qadir"
NAME03="Mahnaz"
NAME04="Ayan"
NAME05="Daisy"
</pre>
<p>We can use a single array to store all the above mentioned names. Following is the simplest method of creating an array variable. This helps assign a value to one of its indices.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
array_name[index]=value
</pre>
<p>Here <i>array_name</i> is the name of the array, <i>index</i> is the index of the item in the array that you want to set, and value is the value you want to set for that item.</p>
<p>As an example, the following commands &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
NAME[0]="Zara"
NAME[1]="Qadir"
NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
</pre>
<p>If you are using the <b>ksh</b> shell, here is the syntax of array initialization &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
set -A array_name value1 value2 ... valuen
</pre>
<p>If you are using the <b>bash</b> shell, here is the syntax of array initialization &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
array_name = (value1 ... valuen)
</pre>
<h2>Accessing Array Values</h2>
<p>After you have set any array variable, you access it as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
${array_name[index]}
</pre>
<p>Here <i>array_name</i> is the name of the array, and <i>index</i> is the index of the value to be accessed. Following is an example to understand the concept &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

NAME[0]="Zara"
NAME[1]="Qadir"
NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
echo "First Index: ${NAME[0]}"
echo "Second Index: ${NAME[1]}"
</pre>
<p>The above example will generate the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
First Index: Zara
Second Index: Qadir
</pre>
<p>You can access all the items in an array in one of the following ways &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
${array_name[*]}
${array_name[@]}
</pre>
<p>Here <b>array_name</b> is the name of the array you are interested in. Following example will help you understand the concept &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

NAME[0]="Zara"
NAME[1]="Qadir"
NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
echo "First Method: ${NAME[*]}"
echo "Second Method: ${NAME[@]}"
</pre>
<p>The above example will generate the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
First Method: Zara Qadir Mahnaz Ayan Daisy
Second Method: Zara Qadir Mahnaz Ayan Daisy
</pre>
<h1>Unix - Shell Basic Operators</h1>
<p>There are various operators supported by each shell. We will discuss in detail about Bourne shell (default shell) in this chapter.</p>
<p>We will now discuss the following operators &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Boolean Operators</li>
<li>String Operators</li>
<li>File Test Operators</li>
</ul>
<p>Bourne shell didn't originally have any mechanism to perform simple arithmetic operations but it uses external programs, either <b>awk</b> or <b>expr</b>.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to add two numbers &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

val=`expr 2 + 2`
echo "Total value : $val"
</pre>
<p>The above script will generate the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Total value : 4
</pre>
<p>The following points need to be considered while adding &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>There must be spaces between operators and expressions. For example, 2&plus;2 is not correct; it should be written as 2 &plus; 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The complete expression should be enclosed between <b>‘ ‘</b>, called the inverted commas.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<p>The following arithmetic operators are supported by Bourne Shell.</p>
<p>Assume variable <b>a</b> holds 10 and variable <b>b</b> holds 20 then &minus;</p>

<h2>Relational Operators</h2>
<p>Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are specific to numeric values. These operators do not work for string values unless their value is numeric.</p>
<p>For example, following operators will work to check a relation between 10 and 20 as well as in between "10" and "20" but not in between "ten" and "twenty".</p>
<p>Assume variable <b>a</b> holds 10 and variable <b>b</b> holds 20 then &minus;</p>

<h1>Unix - Shell Decision Making</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will understand shell decision-making in Unix. While writing a shell script, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one path out of the given two paths. So you need to make use of conditional statements that allow your program to make correct decisions and perform the right actions.</p>
<p>Unix Shell supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. We will now understand two decision-making statements here &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>if...else</b> statement</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>case...esac</b> statement</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The if...else statements</h2>
<p>If else statements are useful decision-making statements which can be used to select an option from a given set of options.</p>
<p>Unix Shell supports following forms of <b>if…else</b> statement &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/if-fi-statement.htm">if...fi statement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/if-else-statement.htm">if...else...fi statement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/if-elif-statement.htm">if...elif...else...fi statement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the if statements check relations using relational operators discussed in the previous chapter.</p>
<h2>The case...esac Statement</h2>
<p>You can use multiple <b>if...elif</b> statements to perform a multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution, especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single variable.</p>
<p>Unix Shell supports <b>case...esac</b> statement which handles exactly this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated <b>if...elif</b> statements.</p>
<p>There is only one form of <b>case...esac</b> statement which has been described in detail here &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/case-esac-statement.htm">case...esac statement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>case...esac</b> statement in the Unix shell is very similar to the <b>switch...case</b> statement we have in other programming languages like <b>C</b> or <b>C++</b> and <b>PERL</b>, etc.</p>
<h1>Unix - Shell Loop Types</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss shell loops in Unix. A loop is a powerful programming tool that enables you to execute a set of commands repeatedly. In this chapter, we will examine the following types of loops available to shell programmers &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/while-loop.htm">The while loop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/for-loop.htm">The for loop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/until-loop.htm">The until loop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/select-loop.htm">The select loop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You will use different loops based on the situation. For example, the <b>while</b> loop executes the given commands until the given condition remains true; the <b>until</b> loop executes until a given condition becomes true.</p>
<p>Once you have good programming practice you will gain the expertise and thereby, start using appropriate loop based on the situation. Here, <b>while</b> and <b>for</b> loops are available in most of the other programming languages like <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>PERL</b>, etc.</p>
<h2>Nesting Loops</h2>
<p>All the loops support nesting concept which means you can put one loop inside another similar one or different loops. This nesting can go up to unlimited number of times based on your requirement.</p>
<p>Here is an example of nesting <b>while</b> loop. The other loops can be nested based on the programming requirement in a similar way &minus;</p>
<h2>Nesting while Loops</h2>
<p>It is possible to use a while loop as part of the body of another while loop.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
while command1 ; # this is loop1, the outer loop
do
   Statement(s) to be executed if command1 is true

   while command2 ; # this is loop2, the inner loop
   do
      Statement(s) to be executed if command2 is true
   done

   Statement(s) to be executed if command1 is true
done
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a simple example of loop nesting. Let's add another countdown loop inside the loop that you used to count to nine &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

a=0
while [ "$a" -lt 10 ]    # this is loop1
do
   b="$a"
   while [ "$b" -ge 0 ]  # this is loop2
   do
      echo -n "$b "
      b=`expr $b - 1`
   done
   echo
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done
</pre>
<p>This will produce the following result. It is important to note how <b>echo -n</b> works here. Here <b>-n</b> option lets echo avoid printing a new line character.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
0
1 0
2 1 0
3 2 1 0
4 3 2 1 0
5 4 3 2 1 0
6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
</pre>
<h1>Unix - Shell Loop Control</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss shell loop control in Unix. So far you have looked at creating loops and working with loops to accomplish different tasks. Sometimes you need to stop a loop or skip iterations of the loop.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn following two statements that are used to control shell loops&minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>break</b> statement</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>continue</b> statement</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The infinite Loop</h2>
<p>All the loops have a limited life and they come out once the condition is false or true depending on the loop.</p>
<p>A loop may continue forever if the required condition is not met. A loop that executes forever without terminating executes for an infinite number of times. For this reason, such loops are called infinite loops.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a simple example that uses the <b>while</b> loop to display the numbers zero to nine &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

a=10

until [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   a=expr $a + 1`
done
</pre>
<p>This loop continues forever because <b>a</b> is always <b>greater than</b> or <b>equal to 10</b> and it is never less than 10.</p>
<h2>The break Statement</h2>
<p>The <b>break</b> statement is used to terminate the execution of the entire loop, after completing the execution of all of the lines of code up to the break statement. It then steps down to the code following the end of the loop.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The following <b>break</b> statement is used to come out of a loop &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
break
</pre>
<p>The break command can also be used to exit from a nested loop using this format &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
break n
</pre>
<p>Here <b>n</b> specifies the <b>n<sup>th</sup></b> enclosing loop to the exit from.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a simple example which shows that loop terminates as soon as <b>a</b> becomes 5 &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

a=0

while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   if [ $a -eq 5 ]
   then
      break
   fi
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
0
1
2
3
4
5
</pre>
<p>Here is a simple example of nested for loop. This script breaks out of both loops if <b>var1 equals 2</b> and <b>var2 equals 0</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

for var1 in 1 2 3
do
   for var2 in 0 5
   do
      if [ $var1 -eq 2 -a $var2 -eq 0 ]
      then
         break 2
      else
         echo "$var1 $var2"
      fi
   done
done
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result. In the inner loop, you have a break command with the argument 2. This indicates that if a condition is met you should break out of outer loop and ultimately from the inner loop as well.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
1 0
1 5
</pre>
<h2>The continue statement</h2>
<p>The <b>continue</b> statement is similar to the <b>break</b> command, except that it causes the current iteration of the loop to exit, rather than the entire loop.</p>
<p>This statement is useful when an error has occurred but you want to try to execute the next iteration of the loop.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
continue
</pre>
<p>Like with the break statement, an integer argument can be given to the continue command to skip commands from nested loops.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
continue n
</pre>
<p>Here <b>n</b> specifies the <b>n<sup>th</sup></b> enclosing loop to continue from.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following loop makes use of the <b>continue</b> statement which returns from the continue statement and starts processing the next statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

NUMS="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"

for NUM in $NUMS
do
   Q=`expr $NUM % 2`
   if [ $Q -eq 0 ]
   then
      echo "Number is an even number!!"
      continue
   fi
   echo "Found odd number"
done
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Found odd number
Number is an even number!!
Found odd number
Number is an even number!!
Found odd number
Number is an even number!!
Found odd number
</pre>
<h1>Unix - Shell Substitution</h1>
<h2>What is Substitution?</h2>
<p>The shell performs substitution when it encounters an expression that contains one or more special characters.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here, the printing value of the variable is substituted by its value. Same time, <b>"\n"</b> is substituted by a new line &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

a=10
echo -e "Value of a is $a \n"
</pre>
<p>You will receive the following result. Here the <b>-e</b> option enables the interpretation of backslash escapes.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value of a is 10
</pre>
<p>Following is the result without <b>-e</b> option &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value of a is 10\n
</pre>
<p>Here are following escape sequences which can be used in echo command &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

</table>
<p>You can use the <b>-E</b> option to disable the interpretation of the backslash escapes (default).</p>
<p>You can use the <b>-n</b> option to disable the insertion of a new line.</p>
<h2>Command Substitution</h2>
<p>Command substitution is the mechanism by which the shell performs a given set of commands and then substitutes their output in the place of the commands.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The command substitution is performed when a command is given as &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
`command`
</pre>
<p>When performing the command substitution make sure that you use the backquote, not the single quote character.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Command substitution is generally used to assign the output of a command to a variable. Each of the following examples demonstrates the command substitution &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

DATE=`date`
echo "Date is $DATE"

USERS=`who | wc -l`
echo "Logged in user are $USERS"

UP=`date ; uptime`
echo "Uptime is $UP"
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Date is Thu Jul  2 03:59:57 MST 2009
Logged in user are 1
Uptime is Thu Jul  2 03:59:57 MST 2009
03:59:57 up 20 days, 14:03,  1 user,  load avg: 0.13, 0.07, 0.15
</pre>
<h2>Variable Substitution</h2>
<p>Variable substitution enables the shell programmer to manipulate the value of a variable based on its state.</p>
<p>Here is the following table for all the possible substitutions &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>

<h1>Unix - Shell Quoting Mechanisms</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the Shell quoting mechanisms. We will start by discussing the metacharacters.</p>
<h2>The Metacharacters</h2>
<p>Unix Shell provides various metacharacters which have special meaning while using them in any Shell Script and causes termination of a word unless quoted.</p>
<p>For example, <b>?</b> matches with a single character while listing files in a directory and an <b>*</b> matches more than one character. Here is a list of most of the shell special characters (also called metacharacters) &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
* ? [ ] ' " \ $ ; &amp; ( ) | ^ &lt; &gt; new-line space tab
</pre>
<p>A character may be quoted (i.e., made to stand for itself) by preceding it with a <b>\</b>.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following example shows how to print a <b>*</b> or a <b>?</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

echo Hello; Word
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

</pre>
<p>Let us now try using a quoted character &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

echo Hello\; Word
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello; Word
</pre>
<p>The <b>$</b> sign is one of the metacharacters, so it must be quoted to avoid special handling by the shell &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

echo "I have \$1200"
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

</table>
<h2>The Single Quotes</h2>
<p>Consider an echo command that contains many special shell characters &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
echo &lt;-$1500.**&gt;; (update?) [y|n]
</pre>
<p>Putting a backslash in front of each special character is tedious and makes the line difficult to read &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
echo \&lt;-\$1500.\*\*\&gt;\; \(update\?\) \[y\|n\]
</pre>
<p>There is an easy way to quote a large group of characters. Put a single quote (') at the beginning and at the end of the string &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
echo '&lt;-$1500.**&gt;; (update?) [y|n]'
</pre>
<p>Characters within single quotes are quoted just as if a backslash is in front of each character. With this, the echo command displays in a proper way.</p>
<p>If a single quote appears within a string to be output, you should not put the whole string within single quotes instead you should precede that using a backslash (\) as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
echo 'It\'s Shell Programming'
</pre>
<h2>The Double Quotes</h2>
<p>Try to execute the following shell script. This shell script makes use of single quote &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
VAR=ZARA
echo '$VAR owes &lt;-$1500.**&gt;; [ as of (`date +%m/%d`) ]'
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$VAR owes &lt;-$1500.**&gt;; [ as of (`date +%m/%d`) ]
</pre>
<p>This is not what had to be displayed. It is obvious that single quotes prevent variable substitution. If you want to substitute variable values and to make inverted commas work as expected, then you would need to put your commands in double quotes as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
VAR=ZARA
echo "$VAR owes &lt;-\$1500.**&gt;; [ as of (`date +%m/%d`) ]"
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ZARA owes &lt;-$1500.**&gt;; [ as of (07/02) ]
</pre>
<p>Double quotes take away the special meaning of all characters except the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>$</b> for parameter substitution</p></li>
<li><p>Backquotes for command substitution</p></li>
<li><p><b>\$</b> to enable literal dollar signs</p></li>
<li><p><b>\`</b> to enable literal backquotes</p></li>
<li><p><b>\"</b> to enable embedded double quotes</p></li>
<li><p><b>\\</b> to enable embedded backslashes</p></li>
<li><p>All other <b>\</b> characters are literal (not special)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Characters within single quotes are quoted just as if a backslash is in front of each character. This helps the echo command display properly.</p>
<p>If a single quote appears within a string to be output, you should not put the whole string within single quotes instead you should precede that using a backslash (\) as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
echo 'It\'s Shell Programming'
</pre>
<h2>The Backquotes</h2>
<p>Putting any Shell command in between <b>backquotes</b> executes the command.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Here is the simple syntax to put any Shell <b>command</b> in between backquotes &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
var = `command`
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The <b>date</b> command is executed in the following example and the produced result is stored in DATA variable.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

<h1>Unix - Shell Input/Output Redirections</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the Shell input/output redirections. Most Unix system commands take input from your terminal and send the resulting output back to your terminal. A command normally reads its input from the standard input, which happens to be your terminal by default. Similarly, a command normally writes its output to standard output, which is again your terminal by default.</p>
<h2>Output Redirection</h2>
<p>The output from a command normally intended for standard output can be easily diverted to a file instead. This capability is known as output redirection.</p>
<p>If the notation &gt; file is appended to any command that normally writes its output to standard output, the output of that command will be written to file instead of your terminal.</p>
<p>Check the following <b>who</b> command which redirects the complete output of the command in the users file.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ who &gt; users
</pre>
<p>Notice that no output appears at the terminal. This is because the output has been redirected from the default standard output device (the terminal) into the specified file. You can check the users file for the complete content &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat users
oko         tty01   Sep 12 07:30
ai          tty15   Sep 12 13:32
ruth        tty21   Sep 12 10:10
pat         tty24   Sep 12 13:07
steve       tty25   Sep 12 13:03
$
</pre>
<p>If a command has its output redirected to a file and the file already contains some data, that data will be lost. Consider the following example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ echo line 1 &gt; users
$ cat users
line 1
$
</pre>
<p>You can use &gt;&gt; operator to append the output in an existing file as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ echo line 2 &gt;&gt; users
$ cat users
line 1
line 2
$
</pre>
<h2>Input Redirection</h2>
<p>Just as the output of a command can be redirected to a file, so can the input of a command be redirected from a file. As the <b>greater-than character &gt;</b> is used for output redirection, the <b>less-than character &lt;</b> is used to redirect the input of a command.</p>
<p>The commands that normally take their input from the standard input can have their input redirected from a file in this manner. For example, to count the number of lines in the file <i>users</i> generated above, you can execute the command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ wc -l users
2 users
$
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following output. You can count the number of lines in the file by redirecting the standard input of the <b>wc</b> command from the file <i>users</i> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ wc -l &lt; users
2
$
</pre>
<p>Note that there is a difference in the output produced by the two forms of the wc command. In the first case, the name of the file users is listed with the line count; in the second case, it is not.</p>
<p>In the first case, wc knows that it is reading its input from the file users. In the second case, it only knows that it is reading its input from standard input so it does not display file name.</p>
<h2>Here Document</h2>
<p>A <b>here document</b> is used to redirect input into an interactive shell script or program.</p>
<p>We can run an interactive program within a shell script without user action by supplying the required input for the interactive program, or interactive shell script.</p>
<p>The general form for a <b>here</b> document is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
command &lt;&lt; delimiter
document
delimiter
</pre>
<p>Here the shell interprets the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operator as an instruction to read input until it finds a line containing the specified delimiter. All the input lines up to the line containing the delimiter are then fed into the standard input of the command.</p>
<p>The delimiter tells the shell that the <b>here</b> document has completed. Without it, the shell continues to read the input forever. The delimiter must be a single word that does not contain spaces or tabs.</p>
<p>Following is the input to the command <b>wc -l</b> to count the total number of lines &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$wc -l &lt;&lt; EOF
   This is a simple lookup program 
	for good (and bad) restaurants
	in Cape Town.
EOF
3
$
</pre>
<p>You can use the <b>here document</b> to print multiple lines using your script as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

cat &lt;&lt; EOF
This is a simple lookup program 
for good (and bad) restaurants
in Cape Town.
EOF	
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is a simple lookup program
for good (and bad) restaurants
in Cape Town.
</pre>
<p>The following script runs a session with the <b>vi</b> text editor and saves the input in the file <b>test.txt</b>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/bin/sh

filename=test.txt
vi $filename &lt;&lt;EndOfCommands

</pre>
<p>If you run this script with vim acting as vi, then you will likely see output like the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ sh test.sh
Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
$
</pre>
<p>After running the script, you should see the following added to the file <b>test.txt</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat test.txt
This file was created automatically from
a shell script
$
</pre>
<h2>Discard the output</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will need to execute a command, but you don't want the output displayed on the screen. In such cases, you can discard the output by redirecting it to the file <b>/dev/null</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ command &gt; /dev/null
</pre>
<p>Here command is the name of the command you want to execute. The file <b>/dev/null</b> is a special file that automatically discards all its input.</p>
<p>To discard both output of a command and its error output, use standard redirection to redirect <b>STDERR</b> to <b>STDOUT</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ command &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
<p>Here <b>2</b> represents <b>STDERR</b> and <b>1</b> represents <b>STDOUT</b>. You can display a message on to STDERR by redirecting STDOUT into STDERR as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ echo message 1&gt;&amp;2
</pre>

<h1>Unix - Shell Functions</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the shell functions. Functions enable you to break down the overall functionality of a script into smaller, logical subsections, which can then be called upon to perform their individual tasks when needed.</p>
<p>Using functions to perform repetitive tasks is an excellent way to create <b>code reuse</b>. This is an important part of modern object-oriented programming principles.</p>
<p>Shell functions are similar to subroutines, procedures, and functions in other programming languages.</p>
<h2>Creating Functions</h2>
<p>To declare a function, simply use the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
function_name () { 
   list of commands
}
</pre>
<p>The name of your function is <b>function_name</b>, and that's what you will use to call it from elsewhere in your scripts. The function name must be followed by parentheses, followed by a list of commands enclosed within braces.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following example shows the use of function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

# Define your function here
Hello () {
   echo "Hello World"
}

# Invoke your function
Hello
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
Hello World
</pre>
<h2>Pass Parameters to a Function</h2>
<p>You can define a function that will accept parameters while calling the function. These parameters would be represented by <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.</p>
<p>Following is an example where we pass two parameters <i>Zara</i> and <i>Ali</i> and then we capture and print these parameters in the function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

# Define your function here
Hello () {
   echo "Hello World $1 $2"
}

# Invoke your function
Hello Zara Ali
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
Hello World Zara Ali
</pre>
<h2>Returning Values from Functions</h2>
<p>If you execute an <b>exit</b> command from inside a function, its effect is not only to terminate execution of the function but also of the shell program that called the function.</p>
<p>If you instead want to just terminate execution of the function, then there is way to come out of a defined function.</p>
<p>Based on the situation you can return any value from your function using the <b>return</b> command whose syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
return code
</pre>
<p>Here <b>code</b> can be anything you choose here, but obviously you should choose something that is meaningful or useful in the context of your script as a whole.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following function returns a value 1 &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

# Define your function here
Hello () {
   echo "Hello World $1 $2"
   return 10
}

# Invoke your function
Hello Zara Ali

# Capture value returnd by last command
ret=$?

echo "Return value is $ret"
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$./test.sh
Hello World Zara Ali
Return value is 10
</pre>
<h2>Nested Functions</h2>
<p>One of the more interesting features of functions is that they can call themselves and also other functions. A function that calls itself is known as a <b><i>recursive function</i></b>.</p>
<p>Following example demonstrates nesting of two functions &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/bin/sh

# Calling one function from another
number_one () {
   echo "This is the first function speaking..."
   number_two
}

number_two () {
   echo "This is now the second function speaking..."
}

# Calling function one.
number_one
</pre>
<p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is the first function speaking...
This is now the second function speaking...
</pre>
<h2>Function Call from Prompt</h2>
<p>You can put definitions for commonly used functions inside your <b><i>.profile</i></b>. These definitions will be available whenever you log in and you can use them at the command prompt.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can group the definitions in a file, say <b><i>test.sh</i></b>, and then execute the file in the current shell by typing &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$. test.sh
</pre>
<p>This has the effect of causing functions defined inside <b><i>test.sh</i></b> to be read and defined to the current shell as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ number_one
This is the first function speaking...
This is now the second function speaking...
$
</pre>
<p>To remove the definition of a function from the shell, use the unset command with the <b>.f</b> option. This command is also used to remove the definition of a variable to the shell.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$unset .f function_name
</pre>
<h1>Unix - Shell Manpage Help</h1>
<p>All the Unix commands come with a number of optional and mandatory options. It is very common to forget the complete syntax of these commands.</p> 
<p>Because no one can possibly remember every Unix command and all its options, we have online help available to mitigate this right from when Unix was at its development stage.</p>
<p>Unix's version of <b>Help files</b> are called <b>man pages</b>. If there is a command name and you are not sure how to use it, then Man Pages help you out with every step.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Here is the simple command that helps you get the detail of any Unix command while working with the system &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$man command
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose there is a command that requires you to get help; assume that you want to know about <b>pwd</b> then you simply need to use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$man pwd
</pre>
<p>The above command helps you with the complete information about the <b>pwd</b> command. Try it yourself at your command prompt to get more detail.</p>
<p>You can get complete detail on <b>man</b> command itself using the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$man man
</pre>
<h2>Man Page Sections</h2>
<p>Man pages are generally divided into sections, which generally vary by the man page author's preference. Following table lists some common sections &minus;</p>

<h2>Useful Shell Commands</h2>
<p>The following link gives you a list of the most important and very frequently used Unix Shell commands.</p>
<p>If you do not know how to use any command, then use man page to get complete detail about the command.</p>
<p>Here is the list of <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-useful-commands.htm">Unix Shell - Useful Commands</a></p>
<h1>Unix - Regular Expressions with SED</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about regular expressions with SED in Unix.</p>
<p>A regular expression is a string that can be used to describe several sequences of characters. Regular expressions are used by several different Unix commands, including <b>ed</b>, <b>sed</b>, <b>awk</b>, <b>grep</b>, and to a more limited extent, <b>vi</b>.</p>
<p>Here <b>SED</b> stands for <b>s</b>tream <b>ed</b>itor. This stream-oriented editor was created exclusively for executing scripts. Thus, all the input you feed into it passes through and goes to STDOUT and it does not change the input file.</p>
<h2>Invoking sed</h2>
<p>Before we start, let us ensure we have a local copy of <b>/etc/passwd</b> text file to work with <b>sed</b>.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, sed can be invoked by sending data through a pipe to it as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed
Usage: sed [OPTION]... {script-other-script} [input-file]...

  -n, --quiet, --silent
                 suppress automatic printing of pattern space
  -e script, --expression = script
...............................
</pre>
<p>The <b>cat</b> command dumps the contents of <b>/etc/passwd</b> to <b>sed</b> through the pipe into sed's pattern space. The pattern space is the internal work buffer that sed uses for its operations.</p>
<h2>The sed General Syntax</h2>
<p>Following is the general syntax for sed &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
/pattern/action
</pre>
<p>Here, <b>pattern</b> is a regular expression, and <b>action</b> is one of the commands given in the following table. If <b>pattern</b> is omitted, <b>action</b> is performed for every line as we have seen above.</p>
<p>The slash character (/) that surrounds the pattern are required because they are used as delimiters.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Range &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>p</b></p>
<p>Prints the line</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>d</b></p>
<p>Deletes the line</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>s/pattern1/pattern2/</b></p>
<p>Substitutes the first occurrence of pattern1 with pattern2</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Deleting All Lines with sed</h2>
<p>We will now understand how to delete all lines with sed. Invoke sed again; but the sed is now supposed to use the <b>editing command delete line</b>, denoted by the single letter <b>d</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed 'd'
$
</pre>
<p>Instead of invoking sed by sending a file to it through a pipe, the sed can be instructed to read the data from a file, as in the following example.</p>
<p>The following command does exactly the same as in the previous example, without the cat command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ sed -e 'd' /etc/passwd
$
</pre>
<h2>The sed Addresses</h2>
<p>The sed also supports addresses. Addresses are either particular locations in a file or a range where a particular editing command should be applied. When the sed encounters no addresses, it performs its operations on every line in the file.</p>
<p>The following command adds a basic address to the sed command you've been using &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed '1d' |more
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
$
</pre>
<p>Notice that the number 1 is added before the <b>delete edit</b> command. This instructs the sed to perform the editing command on the first line of the file. In this example, the sed will delete the first line of <b>/etc/password</b> and print the rest of the file.</p>
<h2>The sed Address Ranges</h2>
<p>We will now understand how to work with <b>the sed address ranges</b>. So what if you want to remove more than one line from a file? You can specify an address range with sed as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed '1, 5d' |more
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
$
</pre>
<p>The above command will be applied on all the lines starting from 1 through 5. This deletes the first five lines.</p>
<p>Try out the following address ranges &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Range &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>'4,10d'</b></p>
<p>Lines starting from the 4<sup>th</sup> till the 10<sup>th</sup> are deleted</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>'10,4d'</b></p>
<p>Only 10<sup>th</sup> line is deleted, because the sed does not work in reverse direction</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>'4,&plus;5d'</b></p>
<p>This matches line 4 in the file, deletes that line, continues to delete the next five lines, and then ceases its deletion and prints the rest</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><b>'2,5!d'</b></p>
<p>This deletes everything except starting from 2<sup>nd</sup> till 5<sup>th</sup> line</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>'1~3d'</b></p>
<p>This deletes the first line, steps over the next three lines, and then deletes the fourth line. Sed continues to apply this pattern until the end of the file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td>
<p><b>'2~2d'</b></p>
<p>This tells sed to delete the second line, step over the next line, delete the next line, and repeat until the end of the file is reached</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">7</td>
<td>
<p><b>'4,10p'</b></p>
<p>Lines starting from 4<sup>th</sup> till 10<sup>th</sup> are printed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">8</td>
<td>
<p><b>'4,d'</b></p>
<p>This generates the syntax error</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">9</td>
<td>
<p><b>',10d'</b></p>
<p>This would also generate syntax error</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; While using the <b>p</b> action, you should use the <b>-n</b> option to avoid repetition of line printing. Check the difference in between the following two commands &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed -n '1,3p'
</pre>
<p>Check the above command without <b>-n</b> as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed '1,3p'
</pre>
<h2>The Substitution Command</h2>
<p>The substitution command, denoted by <b>s</b>, will substitute any string that you specify with any other string that you specify.</p>
<p>To substitute one string with another, the sed needs to have the information on where the first string ends and the substitution string begins. For this, we proceed with bookending the two strings with the forward slash (<b>/</b>) character.</p>
<p>The following command substitutes the first occurrence on a line of the string <b>root</b> with the string <b>amrood</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/root/amrood/'
amrood:x:0:0:root user:/root:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
..........................
</pre>
<p>It is very important to note that sed substitutes only the first occurrence on a line. If the string root occurs more than once on a line only the first match will be replaced.</p>
<p>For the sed to perform a global substitution, add the letter <b>g</b> to the end of the command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/root/amrood/g'
amrood:x:0:0:amrood user:/amrood:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
...........................
</pre>
<h2>Substitution Flags</h2>
<p>There are a number of other useful flags that can be passed in addition to the <b>g</b> flag, and you can specify more than one at a time.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Flag &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>g</b></p>
<p>Replaces all matches, not just the first match</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>NUMBER</b></p>
<p>Replaces only NUMBER<sup>th</sup> match</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>p</b></p>
<p>If substitution was made, then prints the pattern space</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><b>w FILENAME</b></p>
<p>If substitution was made, then writes result to FILENAME</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>I or i</b></p>
<p>Matches in a case-insensitive manner</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td>
<p><b>M or m</b></p>
<p>In addition to the normal behavior of the special regular expression characters ^ and $, this flag causes ^ to match the empty string after a newline and $ to match the empty string before a newline</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Using an Alternative String Separator</h2>
<p>Suppose you have to do a substitution on a string that includes the forward slash character. In this case, you can specify a different separator by providing the designated character after the <b>s</b>.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed 's:/root:/amrood:g'
amrood:x:0:0:amrood user:/amrood:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we have used <b>:</b> as the <b>delimiter</b> instead of slash / because we were trying to search <b>/root</b> instead of the simple root.</p>
<h2>Replacing with Empty Space</h2>
<p>Use an empty substitution string to delete the root string from the <b>/etc/passwd</b> file entirely &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/root//g'
:x:0:0::/:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
</pre>
<h2>Address Substitution</h2>
<p>If you want to substitute the string <b>sh</b> with the string <b>quiet</b> only on line 10, you can specify it as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed '10s/sh/quiet/g'
root:x:0:0:root user:/root:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/quiet
</pre>
<p>Similarly, to do an address range substitution, you could do something like the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/passwd | sed '1,5s/sh/quiet/g'
root:x:0:0:root user:/root:/bin/quiet
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/quiet
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/quiet
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/quiet
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
</pre>
<p>As you can see from the output, the first five lines had the string <b>sh</b> changed to <b>quiet</b>, but the rest of the lines were left untouched.</p>
<h2>The Matching Command</h2>
<p>You would use the <b>p</b> option along with the <b>-n</b> option to print all the matching lines as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat testing | sed -n '/root/p'
root:x:0:0:root user:/root:/bin/sh
[root@ip-72-167-112-17 amrood]# vi testing
root:x:0:0:root user:/root:/bin/sh
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
</pre>
<h2>Using Regular Expression</h2>
<p>While matching patterns, you can use the regular expression which provides more flexibility.</p>
<p>Check the following example which matches all the lines starting with <i>daemon</i> and then deletes them &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat testing | sed '/^daemon/d'
root:x:0:0:root user:/root:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
</pre>
<p>Following is the example which deletes all the lines ending with <b>sh</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat testing | sed '/sh$/d'
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
</pre>
<p>The following table lists four special characters that are very useful in regular expressions.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<h2>Matching Characters</h2>
<p>Look at a few more expressions to demonstrate the use of <b>metacharacters</b>. For example, the following pattern &minus;</p>

<h2>Character Class Keywords</h2>
<p>Some special keywords are commonly available to <b>regexps</b>, especially GNU utilities that employ <b>regexps</b>. These are very useful for sed regular expressions as they simplify things and enhance readability.</p>
<p>For example, the characters <b>a through z</b> and the characters <b>A through Z</b>, constitute one such class of characters that has the keyword <b>[[:alpha:]]</b></p>
<p>Using the alphabet character class keyword, this command prints only those lines in the <b>/etc/syslog.conf</b> file that start with a letter of the alphabet &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat /etc/syslog.conf | sed -n '/^[[:alpha:]]/p'
authpriv.*                         /var/log/secure
mail.*                             -/var/log/maillog

<h2>Aampersand Referencing</h2>
<p>The <b>sed metacharacter &amp;</b> represents the contents of the pattern that was matched. For instance, say you have a file called <b>phone.txt</b> full of phone numbers, such as the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
5555551212
5555551213
5555551214
6665551215
6665551216
7775551217
</pre>
<p>You want to make the <b>area code</b> (the first three digits) surrounded by parentheses for easier reading. To do this, you can use the ampersand replacement character &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ sed -e 's/^[[:digit:]][[:digit:]][[:digit:]]/(&amp;)/g' phone.txt
(555)5551212
(555)5551213
(555)5551214
(666)5551215

(666)5551216
(777)5551217
</pre>
<p>Here in the pattern part you are matching the first 3 digits and then using <b>&amp;</b> you are replacing those 3 digits with the surrounding <b>parentheses</b>.</p>
<h2>Using Multiple sed Commands</h2>
<p>You can use multiple sed commands in a single sed command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ sed -e 'command1' -e 'command2' ... -e 'commandN' files
</pre>
<p>Here <b>command1</b> through <b>commandN</b> are sed commands of the type discussed previously. These commands are applied to each of the lines in the list of files given by files.</p>
<p>Using the same mechanism, we can write the above phone number example as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ sed -e 's/^[[:digit:]]\{3\}/(&amp;)/g'  \ 
   -e 's/)[[:digit:]]\{3\}/&amp;-/g' phone.txt 
(555)555-1212 
(555)555-1213 
(555)555-1214 
(666)555-1215 
(666)555-1216 
(777)555-1217
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In the above example, instead of repeating the character class keyword <b>[[:digit:]]</b> three times, we replaced it with <b>\{3\}</b>, which means the preceding regular expression is matched three times. We have also used <b>\</b> to give line break and this has to be removed before the command is run.</p>
<h2>Back References</h2>
<p>The <b>ampersand metacharacter</b> is useful, but even more useful is the ability to define specific regions in regular expressions. These special regions can be used as reference in your replacement strings. By defining specific parts of a regular expression, you can then refer back to those parts with a special reference character.</p>
<p>To do <b>back references</b>, you have to first define a region and then refer back to that region. To define a region, you insert <b>backslashed parentheses</b> around each region of interest. The first region that you surround with backslashes is then referenced by <b>\1</b>, the second region by <b>\2</b>, and so on.</p>
<p>Assuming <b>phone.txt</b> has the following text &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
(555)555-1212
(555)555-1213
(555)555-1214
(666)555-1215
(666)555-1216
(777)555-1217
</pre>
<p>Try the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ cat phone.txt | sed 's/\(.*)\)\(.*-\)\(.*$\)/Area \ 
   code: \1 Second: \2 Third: \3/' 
Area code: (555) Second: 555- Third: 1212 
Area code: (555) Second: 555- Third: 1213 
Area code: (555) Second: 555- Third: 1214 
Area code: (666) Second: 555- Third: 1215 
Area code: (666) Second: 555- Third: 1216 
Area code: (777) Second: 555- Third: 1217
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In the above example, each regular expression inside the parenthesis would be back referenced by <b>\1</b>, <b>\2</b> and so on. We have used <b>\</b> to give line break here. This should be removed before running the command.</p>
<h1>Unix - File System Basics</h1>
<p>A file system is a logical collection of files on a partition or disk. A partition is a container for information and can span an entire hard drive if desired.</p>
<p>Your hard drive can have various partitions which usually contain only one file system, such as one file system housing the <b>/file system</b> or another containing the <b>/home file system</b>.</p>
<p>One file system per partition allows for the logical maintenance and management of differing file systems.</p>
<p>Everything in Unix is considered to be a file, including physical devices such as DVD-ROMs, USB devices, and floppy drives.</p>
<h2>Directory Structure</h2>
<p>Unix uses a hierarchical file system structure, much like an upside-down tree, with root (/) at the base of the file system and all other directories spreading from there.</p>
<p>A Unix filesystem is a collection of files and directories that has the following properties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It has a root directory (<b>/</b>) that contains other files and directories.</p></li>
<li><p>Each file or directory is uniquely identified by its name, the directory in which it resides, and a unique identifier, typically called an <b>inode</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>By convention, the root directory has an <b>inode</b> number of <b>2</b> and the <b>lost&plus;found</b> directory has an <b>inode</b> number of <b>3</b>. Inode numbers <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> are not used. File inode numbers can be seen by specifying the <b>-i option</b> to <b>ls command</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is self-contained. There are no dependencies between one filesystem and another.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The directories have specific purposes and generally hold the same types of information for easily locating files. Following are the directories that exist on the major versions of Unix &minus;</p>

<h2>The df Command</h2>
<p>The first way to manage your partition space is with the <b>df (disk free)</b> command. The command <b>df -k (disk free)</b> displays the <b>disk space usage in kilobytes</b>, as shown below &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$df -k

<p>You can use the <b>-h (human readable) option</b> to display the output in a format that shows the size in easier-to-understand notation.</p>
<h2>The du Command</h2>
<p>The <b>du (disk usage) command</b> enables you to specify directories to show disk space usage on a particular directory.</p>
<p>This command is helpful if you want to determine how much space a particular directory is taking. The following command displays number of blocks consumed by each directory. A single block may take either 512 Bytes or 1 Kilo Byte depending on your system.</p>

<h2>Mounting the File System</h2>
<p>A file system must be mounted in order to be usable by the system. To see what is currently mounted (available for use) on your system, use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ mount
/dev/vzfs on / type reiserfs (rw,usrquota,grpquota)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nodiratime)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
$
</pre>
<p>The <b>/mnt</b> directory, by the Unix convention, is where temporary mounts (such as CDROM drives, remote network drives, and floppy drives) are located. If you need to mount a file system, you can use the mount command with the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
mount -t file_system_type device_to_mount directory_to_mount_to
</pre>
<p>For example, if you want to mount a <b>CD-ROM</b> to the directory <b>/mnt/cdrom</b>, you can type &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
</pre>
<p>This assumes that your CD-ROM device is called <b>/dev/cdrom</b> and that you want to mount it to <b>/mnt/cdrom</b>. Refer to the mount man page for more specific information or type mount <b>-h</b> at the command line for help information.</p>
<p>After mounting, you can use the cd command to navigate the newly available file system through the mount point you just made.</p>
<h2>Unmounting the File System</h2>
<p>To unmount (remove) the file system from your system, use the <b>umount</b> command by identifying the mount point or device.</p>
<p>For example, <b>to unmount cdrom</b>, use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ umount /dev/cdrom
</pre>
<p>The <b>mount command</b> enables you to access your file systems, but on most modern Unix systems, the <b>automount function</b> makes this process invisible to the user and requires no intervention.</p>
<h2>User and Group Quotas</h2>
<p>The user and group quotas provide the mechanisms by which the amount of space used by a single user or all users within a specific group can be limited to a value defined by the administrator.</p>
<p>Quotas operate around two limits that allow the user to take some action if the amount of space or number of disk blocks start to exceed the administrator defined limits &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Soft Limit</b> &minus; If the user exceeds the limit defined, there is a grace period that allows the user to free up some space.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hard Limit</b> &minus; When the hard limit is reached, regardless of the grace period, no further files or blocks can be allocated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of commands to administer quotas &minus;</p>

<h1>Unix - User Administration</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about user administration in Unix.</p>
<p>There are three types of accounts on a Unix system &minus;</p>
<h3>Root account</h3>
<p>This is also called <b>superuser</b> and would have complete and unfettered control of the system. A superuser can run any commands without any restriction. This user should be assumed as a system administrator.</p>
<h3>System accounts</h3>
<p>System accounts are those needed for the operation of system-specific components for example mail accounts and the <b>sshd</b> accounts. These accounts are usually needed for some specific function on your system, and any modifications to them could adversely affect the system.</p>
<h3>User accounts</h3>
<p>User accounts provide interactive access to the system for users and groups of users. General users are typically assigned to these accounts and usually have limited access to critical system files and directories.</p>
<p>Unix supports a concept of <i>Group Account</i> which logically groups a number of accounts. Every account would be a part of another group account. A Unix group plays important role in handling file permissions and process management.</p>
<h2>Managing Users and Groups</h2>
<p>There are four main user administration files &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>/etc/passwd</b> &minus; Keeps the user account and password information. This file holds the majority of information about accounts on the Unix system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>/etc/shadow</b> &minus; Holds the encrypted password of the corresponding account. Not all the systems support this file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>/etc/group</b> &minus; This file contains the group information for each account.</p></li>
<li><p><b>/etc/gshadow</b> &minus; This file contains secure group account information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Check all the above files using the <b>cat</b> command.</p>
<p>The following table lists out commands that are available on majority of Unix systems to create and manage accounts and groups &minus;</p>

<h2>Create a Group</h2>
<p>We will now understand how to create a group. For this, we need to create groups before creating any account otherwise, we can make use of the existing groups in our system. We have all the groups listed in <b><i>/etc/groups</i></b> file.</p>
<p>All the default groups are system account specific groups and it is not recommended to use them for ordinary accounts. So, following is the syntax to create a new group account &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
 groupadd [-g gid [-o]] [-r] [-f] groupname
</pre>
<p>The following table lists out the parameters &minus;</p>

<td>
<p><b>-o</b></p>
<p>This option permits to add group with non-unique GID</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>-r</b></p>
<p>This flag instructs <b>groupadd</b> to add a system account</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><b>-f </b></p>
<p>This option causes to just exit with success status, if the specified group already exists. With -g, if the specified GID already exists, other (unique) GID is chosen</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>groupname</b></p>
<p>Actual group name to be created</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you do not specify any parameter, then the system makes use of the default values.</p>
<p>Following example creates a <i>developers</i> group with default values, which is very much acceptable for most of the administrators.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ groupadd developers
</pre>
<h2>Modify a Group</h2>
<p>To modify a group, use the <b>groupmod</b> syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ groupmod -n new_modified_group_name old_group_name
</pre>
<p>To change the developers_2 group name to developer, type &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ groupmod -n developer developer_2
</pre>
<p>Here is how you will change the financial GID to 545 &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ groupmod -g 545 developer
</pre>
<h2>Delete a Group</h2>
<p>We will now understand how to delete a group. To delete an existing group, all you need is the <b>groupdel command</b> and the <b>group name</b>. To delete the financial group, the command is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ groupdel developer
</pre>
<p>This removes only the group, not the files associated with that group. The files are still accessible by their owners.</p>
<h2>Create an Account</h2>
<p>Let us see how to create a new account on your Unix system. Following is the syntax to create a user's account &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
useradd -d homedir -g groupname -m -s shell -u userid accountname
</pre>
<p>The following table lists out the parameters &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;width:8%">S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Option &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td>
<p><b>-d homedir</b></p>
<p>Specifies home directory for the account</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td>
<p><b>-g groupname</b></p>
<p>Specifies a group account for this account</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>-m</b></p>
<p>Creates the home directory if it doesn't exist</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><b>-s shell</b></p>
<p>Specifies the default shell for this account</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>-u userid</b></p>
<p>You can specify a user id for this account</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td>
<p><b>accountname</b></p>
<p>Actual account name to be created</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you do not specify any parameter, then the system makes use of the default values. The <b>useradd</b> command modifies the <b>/etc/passwd</b>, <b>/etc/shadow</b>, and <b>/etc/group</b> files and creates a home directory.</p>
<p>Following is the example that creates an account <b><i>mcmohd</i></b>, setting its home directory to <b><i>/home/mcmohd</i></b> and the group as <b><i>developers</i></b>. This user would have Korn Shell assigned to it.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ useradd -d /home/mcmohd -g developers -s /bin/ksh mcmohd
</pre>
<p>Before issuing the above command, make sure you already have the <i>developers</i> group created using the <b><i>groupadd</i></b> command.</p>
<p>Once an account is created you can set its password using the <b>passwd</b> command as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ passwd mcmohd20
Changing password for user mcmohd20.
New UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
</pre>
<p>When you type <b><i>passwd accountname</i></b>, it gives you an option to change the password, provided you are a superuser. Otherwise, you can change just your password using the same command but without specifying your account name.</p>
<h2>Modify an Account</h2>
<p>The <b>usermod</b> command enables you to make changes to an existing account from the command line. It uses the same arguments as the <b>useradd</b> command, plus the -l argument, which allows you to change the account name.</p>
<p>For example, to change the account name <b><i>mcmohd</i></b> to <b><i>mcmohd20</i></b> and to change home directory accordingly, you will need to issue the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ usermod -d /home/mcmohd20 -m -l mcmohd mcmohd20
</pre>
<h2>Delete an Account</h2>
<p>The <b>userdel</b> command can be used to delete an existing user. This is a very dangerous command if not used with caution.</p>
<p>There is only one argument or option available for the command <b>.r</b>, for removing the account's home directory and mail file.</p>
<p>For example, to remove account <i>mcmohd20</i>, issue the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ userdel -r mcmohd20
</pre>
<p>If you want to keep the home directory for backup purposes, omit the <b>-r</b> option. You can remove the home directory as needed at a later time.</p>

<h1>Unix - System Logging</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about system logging in Unix.</p>
<p>Unix systems have a very flexible and powerful logging system, which enables you to record almost anything you can imagine and then manipulate the logs to retrieve the information you require.</p>
<p>Many versions of Unix provide a general-purpose logging facility called <b>syslog</b>. Individual programs that need to have information logged, send the information to syslog.</p>
<p>Unix <i>syslog</i> is a host-configurable, uniform system logging facility. The system uses a centralized system logging process that runs the program <b>/etc/syslogd</b> or <b>/etc/syslog</b>.</p>
<p>The operation of the system logger is quite straightforward. Programs send their log entries to <i>syslogd</i>, which consults the configuration file <b>/etc/syslogd.conf</b> or <b>/etc/syslog</b> and, when a match is found, writes the log message to the desired log file.</p>
<p>There are four basic syslog terms that you should understand &minus;</p>

<p>The combination of facilities and levels enables you to be discerning about what is logged and where that information goes.</p>
<p>As each program sends its messages dutifully to the system logger, the logger makes decisions on what to keep track of and what to discard based on the levels defined in the selector.</p>
<p>When you specify a level, the system will keep track of everything at that level and higher.</p>
<h2>The /etc/syslog.conf file</h2>
<p>The <b>/etc/syslog.conf</b> file controls where messages are logged. A typical <b>syslog.conf</b> file might look like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
*.err;kern.debug;auth.notice /dev/console
daemon,auth.notice           /var/log/messages
lpr.info                     /var/log/lpr.log
mail.*                       /var/log/mail.log
ftp.*                        /var/log/ftp.log
auth.*                       @prep.ai.mit.edu
auth.*                       root,amrood
netinfo.err                  /var/log/netinfo.log
install.*                    /var/log/install.log
*.emerg                      *
*.alert                      |program_name
mark.*                       /dev/console
</pre>
<p>Each line of the file contains two parts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A <b>message selector</b> that specifies which kind of messages to log. For example, all error messages or all debugging messages from the kernel.</p></li>
<li><p>An <b>action field</b> that says what should be done with the message. For example, put it in a file or send the message to a user's terminal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following are the notable points for the above configuration &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Message selectors have two parts: <b>a facility</b> and <b>a priority</b>. For example, <i>kern.debug</i> selects all debug messages (the priority) generated by the kernel (the facility).</p></li>
<li><p>Message selector <i>kern.debug</i> selects all priorities that are greater than debug.</p></li>
<li><p>An asterisk in place of either the facility or the priority indicates "all". For example, <b>*.debug</b> means all debug messages, while <b>kern.*</b> means all messages generated by the kernel.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also use commas to specify multiple facilities. Two or more selectors can be grouped together by using a semicolon.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Logging Actions</h2>
<p>The action field specifies one of five actions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Log message to a file or a device. For example, <b>/var/log/lpr.log</b> or <b>/dev/console</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a message to a user. You can specify multiple usernames by separating them with commas; for example, root, amrood.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a message to all users. In this case, the action field consists of an asterisk; for example, *.</p></li>
<li><p>Pipe the message to a program. In this case, the program is specified after the Unix pipe symbol (|).</p></li>
<li><p>Send the message to the syslog on another host. In this case, the action field consists of a hostname, preceded by an at sign; for example, @tutorialspoint.com.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The logger Command</h2>
<p>Unix provides the <b>logger</b> command, which is an extremely useful command to deal with system logging. The <b>logger</b> command sends logging messages to the syslogd daemon, and consequently provokes system logging.</p>
<p>This means we can check from the command line at any time the <b>syslogd</b> daemon and its configuration. The logger command provides a method for adding one-line entries to the system log file from the command line.</p>
<p>The format of the command is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
logger [-i] [-f file] [-p priority] [-t tag] [message]...
</pre>
<p>Here is the detail of the parameters &minus;</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td>
<p><b>-p priority</b></p>
<p>Enters the message with the specified priority (specified selector entry); the message priority can be specified numerically, or as a facility.priority pair. The default priority is user.notice.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td>
<p><b>-t tag</b></p>
<p>Marks each line added to the log with the specified tag.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td>
<p><b>message</b></p>
<p>The string arguments whose contents are concatenated together in the specified order, separated by the space.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>You can use <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-manpage-help.htm">Manpage Help</a> to check complete syntax for this command.</p>
<h2>Log Rotation</h2>
<p>Log files have the propensity to grow very fast and consume large amounts of disk space. To enable log rotations, most distributions use tools such as <b><i>newsyslog</i></b> or <b><i>logrotate</i></b>.</p>
<p>These tools should be called on a frequent time interval using the <b>cron daemon</b>. Check the man pages for <i>newsyslog</i> or <i>logrotate</i> for more details.</p>
<h2>Important Log Locations</h2>
<p>All the system applications create their log files in <b><i>/var/log</i></b> and its sub-directories. Here are few important applications and their corresponding log directories &minus;</p>

<h1>Unix - Signals and Traps</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about Signals and Traps in Unix.</p>
<p>Signals are software interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occurred. The events can vary from user requests to illegal memory access errors. Some signals, such as the interrupt signal, indicate that a user has asked the program to do something that is not in the usual flow of control.</p>
<p>The following table lists out common signals you might encounter and want to use in your programs &minus;</p>

<p>The actual list of signals varies between Solaris, HP-UX, and Linux.</p>
<h2>Default Actions</h2>
<p>Every signal has a default action associated with it. The default action for a signal is the action that a script or program performs when it receives a signal.</p>
<p>Some of the possible default actions are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Terminate the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignore the signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Dump core. This creates a file called <b>core</b> containing the memory image of the process when it received the signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue a stopped process.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sending Signals</h2>
<p>There are several methods of delivering signals to a program or script. One of the most common is for a user to type <b>CONTROL-C</b> or the <b>INTERRUPT key</b> while a script is executing.</p>
<p>When you press the <b><i>Ctrl+C</i></b> key, a <b>SIGINT</b> is sent to the script and as per defined default action script terminates.</p>
<p>The other common method for delivering signals is to use the <b>kill command</b>, the syntax of which is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ kill -signal pid
</pre>
<p>Here <b>signal</b> is either the number or name of the signal to deliver and <b>pid</b> is the process ID that the signal should be sent to. For Example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ kill -1 1001
</pre>
<p>The above command sends the HUP or hang-up signal to the program that is running with <b>process ID 1001</b>. To send a kill signal to the same process, use the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ kill -9 1001
</pre>
<p>This kills the process running with <b>process ID 1001</b>.</p>
<h2>Trapping Signals</h2>
<p>When you press the <i>Ctrl+C</i> or Break key at your terminal during execution of a shell program, normally that program is immediately terminated, and your command prompt returns. This may not always be desirable. For instance, you may end up leaving a bunch of temporary files that won't get cleaned up.</p>
<p>Trapping these signals is quite easy, and the trap command has the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap commands signals
</pre>
<p>Here <i>command</i> can be any valid Unix command, or even a user-defined function, and signal can be a list of any number of signals you want to trap.</p>
<p>There are two common uses for trap in shell scripts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Clean up temporary files</li>
<li>Ignore signals</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleaning Up Temporary Files</h2>
<p>As an example of the trap command, the following shows how you can remove some files and then exit if someone tries to abort the program from the terminal &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap "rm -f $WORKDIR/work1$$ $WORKDIR/dataout$$; exit" 2
</pre>
<p>From the point in the shell program that this trap is executed, the two files <b><i>work1$$</i></b> and <b><i>dataout$$</i></b> will be automatically removed if signal number 2 is received by the program.</p>
<p>Hence, if the user interrupts the execution of the program after this trap is executed, you can be assured that these two files will be cleaned up. The <b>exit</b> command that follows the <b>rm</b> is necessary because without it, the execution would continue in the program at the point that it left off when the signal was received.</p>
<p>Signal number 1 is generated for <b>hangup</b>. Either someone intentionally hangs up the line or the line gets accidentally disconnected.</p>
<p>You can modify the preceding trap to also remove the two specified files in this case by adding signal number 1 to the list of signals &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap "rm $WORKDIR/work1$$ $WORKDIR/dataout$$; exit" 1 2
</pre>
<p>Now these files will be removed if the line gets hung up or if the <i>Ctrl+C</i> key gets pressed.</p>
<p>The commands specified to trap must be enclosed in quotes, if they contain more than one command. Also note that the shell scans the command line at the time that the trap command gets executed and also when one of the listed signals is received.</p>
<p>Thus, in the preceding example, the value of <b>WORKDIR</b> and <b>$$</b> will be substituted at the time that the trap command is executed. If you wanted this substitution to occur at the time that either signal 1 or 2 was received, you can put the commands inside single quotes &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap 'rm $WORKDIR/work1$$ $WORKDIR/dataout$$; exit' 1 2
</pre>
<h2>Ignoring Signals</h2>
<p>If the command listed for trap is null, the specified signal will be ignored when received. For example, the command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap '' 2
</pre>
<p>This specifies that the interrupt signal is to be ignored. You might want to ignore certain signals when performing an operation that you don't want to be interrupted. You can specify multiple signals to be ignored as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap '' 1 2 3 15
</pre>
<p>Note that the first argument must be specified for a signal to be ignored and is not equivalent to writing the following, which has a separate meaning of its own &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap  2
</pre>
<p>If you ignore a signal, all subshells also ignore that signal. However, if you specify an action to be taken on the receipt of a signal, all subshells will still take the default action on receipt of that signal.</p>
<h2>Resetting Traps</h2>
<p>After you've changed the default action to be taken on receipt of a signal, you can change it back again with the trap if you simply omit the first argument; so &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ trap 1 2
</pre>
<p>This resets the action to be taken on the receipt of signals 1 or 2 back to the default.</p>
