<p>In this chapter, we will understand how to explore Window in Word 2010. Following is the basic window which you get when you start the Word application. Let us understand the various important parts of this window..</p>
<img src="images/explore_word_window.jpg" alt="Explore Word Window" />
<h2>File Tab</h2>
<p>The File tab replaces the Office button from Word 2007. You can click it to check the <b>Backstage view</b>. This is where you come when you need to open or save files, create new documents, print a document, and do other file-related operations.</p>
<h2>Quick Access Toolbar</h2>
<p>This you will find just above the <b>File tab</b>. This is a convenient resting place for the mostfrequently used commands in Word. You can customize this toolbar based on your comfort.</p>
<h2>Ribbon</h2>
<img src="images/ribbon.jpg" alt="Word Ribbon" />
<p>Ribbon contains commands organized in three components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Tabs</b> &minus; These appear across the top of the Ribbon and contain groups of related commands. Home, Insert, Page Layout are examples of ribbon tabs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Groups</b> &minus; They organize related commands; each group name appears below the group on the Ribbon. For example, group of commands related to fonts or group of commands related to alignment, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Commands</b> &minus; Commands appear within each group as mentioned above.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Title bar</h2>
<p>This lies in the middle and at the top of the window. Title bar shows the program and document titles.</p>
<h2>Rulers</h2>
<p>Word has two rulers - a horizontal ruler and a vertical ruler. The horizontal ruler appears just beneath the Ribbon and is used to set margins and tab stops. The vertical ruler appears on the left edge of the Word window and is used to gauge the vertical position of elements on the page.</p>
<h2>Help</h2>
<p>The <b>Help Icon</b> can be used to get word related help anytime you like. This provides nice tutorial on various subjects related to word.</p>
<h2>Zoom Control</h2>
<p>Zoom control lets you zoom in for a closer look at your text. The zoom control consists of a slider that you can slide left or right to zoom in or out; you can click the + buttons to increase or decrease the zoom factor.</p>
<h2>View Buttons</h2>
<p>The group of five buttons located to the left of the Zoom control, near the bottom of the screen, lets you switch through the Word's various document views.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Print Layout view</b> &minus; This displays pages exactly as they will appear when printed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Full Screen Reading view</b> &minus; This gives a full screen view of the document.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Web Layout view</b> &minus; This shows how a document appears when viewed by a Web browser, such as Internet Explorer.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Outline view</b> &minus; This lets you work with outlines established using Word’s standard heading styles.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Draft view</b> &minus; This formats text as it appears on the printed page with a few exceptions. For example, headers and footers aren't shown. Most people prefer this mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Document Area</h2>
<p>This is the area where you type. The flashing vertical bar is called the insertion point and it represents the location where text will appear when you type.</p>
<h2>Status Bar</h2>
<p>This displays the document information as well as the insertion point location. From left to right, this bar contains the total number of pages and words in the document, language, etc.</p>
<p>You can configure the status bar by right-clicking anywhere on it and by selecting or deselecting options from the provided list.</p>
<h2>Dialog Box Launcher</h2>
<p>This appears as very small arrow in the lower-right corner of many groups on the Ribbon. Clicking this button opens a dialog box or task pane that provides more options about the group.</p>
<h1>Backstage View in Word 2010</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the <b>Backstage View</b> in Word 2010. The Backstage view was introduced in Word 2010. This acts as the central place for managing your documents. The backstage view helps in creating new documents, saving and opening documents, printing and sharing documents, and so on.</p>
<p>Getting to the Backstage View is easy: Just click the <b>File tab</b>, located in the upper-left corner of the Word Ribbon. If you already do not have any opened document, then you will see a window listing down all the recently opened documents as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Zoom In-Out in Word 2010</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to zoom in and zoom out in Word 2010. Microsoft Word provides a functionality to apply zoom-in and zoom-out operations on a document. When we apply the zoom-in operation, it enlarges the size of text whereas applying the zoom-out operation reduces the size of text.</p>
<p>A zoom operation just changes the size of the font on-screen without impacting any other attribute of the document. You can apply the zoom operation in various ways as explained in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Zoom-in &amp; Zoom-out using view tab</h2>
<p>Here is the simple procedure to apply the zoom-in or the zoom-out operations using the View tab &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Click the <b>View</b> tab and then click the <b>Zoom</b> button as shown below.</p>
<img src="images/zoom_button.jpg" alt="Zoom Button" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; When you click the <b>Zoom</b> button, a Zoom dialog box will appear as shown below. This will display the zoom options box to select a value to reduce or increase the size of the document on-screen. By default, it will be 100%; you can select 200% to increase the size of the font or 75% to reduce the size of the font.</p>
<p>You can click the <b>Many pages</b> down arrow and select to display multiple pages.</p>
<img src="images/zoom_options.jpg" alt="Zoom Options" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Once you are done with selecting an option, click <b>OK</b> to apply the changes on the document.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Try different options available, for example <b>Page Width</b> and <b>Text Width</b>.</p>
<h2>Zoom-in &amp; Zoom-out using (+) and (-) Buttons</h2>
<p>The following screenshot shows two buttons <b>Zoom-out</b> which is the <b>(-)</b> button and <b>Zoom-in</b> which is the <b>(+)</b> button.</p>
<img src="images/zoom_button2.jpg" alt="Zoom Button 2" />
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Click the <b>Zoom-out</b> button, you will find that your document size will decrease by 10% each time you click the button. Similar way, if you click on <b>Zoom-in</b> button your document size will increase by 10% each time you click the button.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try this simple operation with different values to see the difference. The above screenshot shows 140% zoom-in view of the document.</p>
<h1>Special Symbols in Word 2010</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the use of special symbols in Word 2010. Your keyboard may not have many characters available but you want to use those characters in your document; in such situations, you have the option to insert <b>Special Symbols</b> the way we will further understand in this chapter.</p>
<p>To insert symbols that are occasionally used, follow the steps in this section. If you find yourself using a particular symbol frequently, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it.</p>
<h2>Insert Special Symbols</h2>
<p>Here is a simple procedure to apply zoom-in or zoom-out operation using the View tab &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; To insert a special symbol, bring your cursor at the place where you want to insert the symbol. Click the <b>Insert</b> tab. You will find two options under the symbol button <b>(a) Equation</b> and <b>(b) Symbols</b>. Click either of these two options based on your requirement. You will further use equations while preparing mathematical or scientific or any similar document. For now, we are going to understand the use of the <b>Symbol</b> button as shown below.</p>
<img src="images/symbol_button.jpg" alt="Symbol Button" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; When you click the <b>Symbol</b> button, a small list of symbols will appear as shown below.</p>
<img src="images/symbol_box.jpg" alt="Symbol Box" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Now click on any of the available symbols in the box to insert that in your document at the selected location. If you do not find the desired symbol in this small box, then you can click at the <b>More Symbols</b> option to have a wide range of symbols as shown below in the symbol dialog box. You can select any of the symbol and then click the <b>Insert</b> button to insert the selected symbol.</p>
<img src="images/symbol_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Symbol Dialog Box" />
<h2>Assign Shortcut Key</h2>
<p>You can assign a keyboard shortcut to type any of the available symbol. Following are the steps to assign <b>Ctrl + Q</b> key to insert the &copy; symbol which is one of the available symbols in the special symbols list &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Assume you already have the following symbol dialog box opened.</p>
<img src="images/shortcut_key.jpg" alt="Shortcut Key" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the symbol for which a shortcut key needs to be assigned. Now click <b>Shortcut Key</b> button which will display the following <b>Customize Keyboard</b> dialog box.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Now type the selected shortcut key in the shortcut key box. You press <b>Ctrl + Q</b> and then click the <b>Assign</b> button to assign the shortcut key. You will see that the selected key will be added in the list of assigned keys. Finally, use the <b>Close</b> button to close the dialog box.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Now try to type <b>Ctrl + Q</b> using the keyboard directly and you will find that you are able to type &copy; symbol without going into the symbol dialog box. </p>
<h1>Undo Changes in Word 2010</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to undo and redo changes in Word 2010. Microsoft word provides two important features called the <b>Undo</b> and the <b>Repeat</b> or <b>Redo</b>. The Undo feature is used to undo the previous action and the <b>Repeat</b> or <b>Redo</b> feature is used to repeat the previous action.</p>
<p>For example, if you mistakenly delete text, you can use the <b>Undo</b> feature to recover it. In a similar way, if you delete a character and you want to delete more characters then you can use the <b>Repeat</b> operation.</p>
<h2>How to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2>
<p>You can access the Undo and Repeat buttons from the Quick Access toolbar. You should make a note that the <b>Repeat</b> button is also called <b>Redo</b> button and both the operations have the same meaning.</p>
<img src="images/undo_button.jpg" alt="Undo and Repeat Buttons" />
<p>Here is the simple procedure to apply <b>undo</b> or <b>repeat</b> (redo) operations &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Let us type some text in a blank document. Now click the <b>Repeat</b> (Redo) button and you will see that Word will repeat the same operation for you.</p>
<img src="images/repeat_operation.jpg" alt="Repeat Operation" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Now to examine the <b>undo</b> operation, let us delete the last word <b>operation</b> character by character so that you have the following text remaining in the line.</p>
<img src="images/undo_operation.jpg" alt="Undo Operation" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Let us try to click the <b>Undo</b> button one by one. You will see that Word will recover all the deleted characters one by one after performing a few undo operations.</p>
<img src="images/undo_operation2.jpg" alt="Undo Operation2" />
<h2>Shortcuts to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2>
<p>Though you can access the <b>Undo</b> and <b>Repeat</b> commands from the Quick Access toolbar, but because these commands are the most frequently used commands, we recommend you memorize their keyboard shortcuts which are as follows &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;width:10%">S.No</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Shortcuts &amp; Operation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">1</td>
<td><p><b>Ctrl + Z</b></p>
<p>Undoes the previous action.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">2</td>
<td><p><b>Ctrl + Y</b></p>
<p>Repeats the previous action.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Note that if the previous action was Undo, <b>Ctrl+Y</b> redoes the Undone action.</p>
<h1>Setting Text Fonts in Word 2010</h1>

<p>We assume you are familiar with how to create a spreadsheet program; you can construct your word cell formula. Word formulae uses a reference system to refer to an individual table cells. Each column is identified by a letter, starting with A for the first column, B for the second column, and so on. After the letter comes the row number. Thus, the first cell in the first row is A1, the third cell in the fourth row is C4, and so on.</p>
<p>Following are useful points to help you in constructing a word cell formula.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">S.No</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Cell References and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">1</td>
<td>A single cell reference, such as B3 or F7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">2</td>
<td>A range of cells, such as A4:A9 or C5:C13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">3</td>
<td>A series of individual cells, such as A3, B4, C5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">4</td>
<td><b>ABOVE</b>, referring to all cells in the column above the current cell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">5</td>
<td><b>BELOW</b>, referring to all cells in the column below the current cell.</td>

<p>Once you set a password for a document then you will be able to open the document only if you know the password. If you forget your password, then there is no way to recover it and to open the document. So you need to be careful while setting a password for your important document.</p>
<p>The following steps will help you set a password for a Word document.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Open a Word document for which you want to set a password.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the <b>File tab</b> and then click the <b>Info</b> option and finally the <b>Protect Document</b> button which will display a list of options to be selected.</p>
<img src="images/protect_document.jpg" alt="Protect Document" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select the <b>Encrypt with Password</b> option simply by clicking over it. This will display an <b>Encrypt Document</b> dialog box asking for a password to encrypt the document. The same dialog box will appear twice to enter the same password. After entering password each time, click the <b>OK</b> button.</p>
<img src="images/encrypt_document.jpg" alt="Encrypt Document" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Save the changes, and finally you will have your document password protected. Next time when someone tries to open this document, it will ask for the password before displaying the document content, which confirms that now your document is password protected and you need password to open the document.</p>

<h2>Remove Document Password</h2>
<p>You can remove a document password only after opening it successfully. The following steps will help you remove password protection from your Word document.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Open a Word document the password of which needs to be removed. You will need the correct password to open the document.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the <b>File tab</b> followed by the Info option and finally the <b>Protect Document</b> button which will display a list of options to be selected.</p>
<img src="images/protect_document.jpg" alt="Protect Document" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select the <b>Encrypt with Password</b> option simply by clicking over it. This will display an <b>Encrypt Document</b> dialog box and password which will be in a dotted pattern. You need to remove this dotted pattern from the box and make it clear to remove the password from the document.</p>
<img src="images/clear_password_dialog.jpg" alt="Clear Password Dialog" />
<p>Now when you will open your document next time, Word will not ask you for any password because you have removed the password protection from the document.</p>
<h2>Set Editing &amp; Formatting Restrictions</h2>
<p>The following steps will help you set editing restrictions in a Word document.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Open a Word document for which you want to set editing restrictions.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the <b>File tab</b> and then click the <b>Info</b> option and finally the <b>Protect Document</b> button which will display a list of options to be selected.</p>
<img src="images/protect_document2.jpg" alt="Protect Document" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select the <b>Restrict Editing</b> option simply by clicking over it. This will open the actual document and it will also give you the option to set editing restrictions in the <b>Restrict Formatting and Editing area</b>. Here you can set formatting as well as editing restrictions on the document.</p>
<img src="images/restrict_editing.jpg" alt="Restrict Editing" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; One you are done with your setting, click the <b>Yes, Start Enforcing Protection</b> button which will display a <b>Start Enforcing Protection</b> dialog box asking for password so that no one else can change the setting. You can enter the password or you can leave it simply blank which means there is no password setting for this protection.</p>
<img src="images/password_dialog2.jpg" alt="Password Dialog" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Finally click the <b>OK</b> button and you will find that your document is editing <i>(or formatting if you applied)</i> protected.</p>
<h2>Remove Editing &amp; Formatting Restrictions</h2>
<p>You can remove the editing restriction from your document using these simple steps.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Open a Word document for which you want to remove the editing restriction.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the <b>File tab</b> and then click the <b>Info</b> option and finally the <b>Protect Document</b> button; this will display a list of options to be selected.</p>
<img src="images/protect_document2.jpg" alt="Protect Document" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select the <b>Restrict Editing</b> option simply by clicking over it. This will display the <b>Restrict Formatting and Editing</b> area as follows.</p>
<img src="images/stop_protection.jpg" alt="Stop Protection" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Now click the <b>Stop Protection</b> button. If you had set up a password at the time of setting the editing or formatting restrictions, then you will need the same password to remove the editing or formatting restrictions. Word will now ask for the same using the <b>Unprotect Document Dialog</b> box , otherwise it will simply remove the restrictions.</p>

<h1>Set Watermark in Word 2010</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to set watermark in a Word document. A watermark is a picture that shows up faintly behind the text on a Word document page. When you draft a document, you can watermark the document with <i>Draft Copy</i> stamp, or you can watermark a duplicate document with the <i>Duplicate</i> stamp. Microsoft Word allows you to stamp with watermark using simple steps explained in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Set Standard Watermark</h2>
<p>The following steps will help you set standard watermark in word document. A standard watermark is the one which is already defined by words and cannot modify their font or color etc.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Open a word document in which you want to add a watermark.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Click the <b>Page Layout tab</b> and then click the <b>Watermark</b> button to display a list of standard watermark options.</p>
<img src="images/standard_watermark.jpg" alt="Standard Watermark" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; You can select any of the available standard watermarks by simply clicking over it. This will be applied to all the pages of the word. Assume we select the <b>Confidential</b> watermark.</p>
