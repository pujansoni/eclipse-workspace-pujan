<h1>DW - Overview</h1>
<p>A Data warehouse is known as a central repository to store the data from one or multiple heterogeneous data sources. Data warehouse is used for reporting and analyzing of information and stores both historical and current data. The data in DW system is used for Analytical reporting, which is later used by Business Analysts, Sales Managers or Knowledge workers for decision-making.</p>
<p>The data in DW system is loaded from an operational transaction system like Sales, Marketing, HR, SCM, etc. It may pass through operational data store or other transformations before it is loaded to the DW system for information processing.</p>
<h2>Data Warehouse – Key Features</h2>
<p>The key features of a DW System are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It is central data repository where data is stored from one or more heterogeneous data sources.</p></li>
<li><p>A DW system stores both current and historical data. Normally a DW system stores 5-10 years of historical data.</p></li>
<li><p>A DW system is always kept separate from an operational transaction system.</p></li>
<li><p>Data in DW system is used for different types of analytical reporting range from Quarterly to Annual comparison.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Need of a DW System</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a home loan agency where data is coming from multiple applications like- marketing, sales, ERP, HRM, MM etc. This data is extracted, transformed and loaded in Data Warehouse.</p>
<p>For example, if you have to compare the Quarterly/Annual sales of a product, you cannot use an Operational transactional database, as this will hang the transaction system. Therefore, a Data Warehouse is used for this purpose.</p>
<h2>Difference between DW and ODB</h2>
<p>The differences between a Data Warehouse and Operational Database (Transactional Database) are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A Transactional system is designed for known workloads and transactions like updating a user record, searching a record, etc. However, Data Warehouse transactions are more complex and present a general form of data.</p></li>
<li><p>A Transactional system contains the current data of an organization and Data warehouse normally contains the historical data.</p></li>
<li><p>Transactional system supports parallel processing of multiple transactions. Concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are required to maintain consistency of the database.</p></li>
<li><p>An Operational database query allows to read and modify operations (delete and Update) while an OLAP query needs only read-only access of stored data (Select statement).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>DW Architecture</h2>
<p>Data Warehousing involves data cleaning, data integration, and data consolidations.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/dw_architecture.jpg" alt="DW Architecture" />
<p>A Data Warehouse has a 3-layer architecture &minus; <b>Data Source Layer, Integration Layer,</b> and <b>Presentation Layer</b>. The illustration given above shows the common architecture of a Data Warehouse system.</p>
<h1>DW - Types</h1>
<p>There are four types of Data Warehousing system.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data Mart</li>
<li>Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)</li>
<li>Online Transactional Processing (OLTP)</li>
<li>Predictive Analysis (PA)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Mart</h2>
<p>A Data Mart is known as the simplest form of a Data Warehouse system and normally consists of a single functional area in an organization like sales, finance or marketing, etc.</p>
<p>Data Mart in an organization and is created and managed by a single department. As it belongs to a single department, the department usually gets data from only a few or one type of sources/applications. This source could be an internal operational system, a data warehouse or an external system.</p>
<h2>Online Analytical Processing</h2>
<p>In an OLAP system, there are less number of transactions as compared to a transactional system. The queries executed are complex in nature and involves data aggregations.</p>
<h3>What is an Aggregation?</h3>
<p>We save tables with aggregated data like yearly (1 row), quarterly (4 rows), monthly (12 rows) or so, if someone has to do a year to year comparison, only one row will be processed. However, in an un-aggregated table it will compare all rows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE title = 'Programmer';
</pre>
<h3>Effective Measures in an OLAP system</h3>
<p>Response time is known as one of the most effective and key measure in an <b>OLAP</b> system. Aggregated stored data is maintained in multi-dimensional schemas like star schemas (When data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions and into facts and aggregate facts, it is called Schemas).</p>
<p>The latency of an OLAP system is of a few hours as compared to the data marts where latency is expected closer to a day.</p>
<h2>Online Transaction Processing</h2>
<p>In an OLTP system, there are a large number of short online transactions such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.</p>
<p>In an OLTP system, an effective measure is the processing time of short transactions and is very less. It controls data integrity in multi-access environments. For an OLTP system, the number of transactions per second measures the <b>effectiveness</b>. An OLTP data warehouse system contains current and detailed data and is maintained in the schemas in the entity model (3NF).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Day-to-Day transaction system in a retail store, where the customer records are inserted, updated and deleted on a daily basis. It provides very fast query processing. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. Schema used to store OLTP database is the Entity model.</p>
<h2>Differences between OLTP and OLAP</h2>
<p>The following illustrations shows the key differences between an <b>OLTP</b> and <b>OLAP</b> system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/oltp_and_olap.jpg" alt="OLTP and OLAP" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Indexes</b> &minus; OLTP system has only few indexes while in an OLAP system there are many indexes for performance optimization.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Joins</b> &minus; In an OLTP system, large number of joins and data are normalized. However, in an OLAP system there are less joins and are de-normalized.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Aggregation</b> &minus; In an OLTP system, data is not aggregated while in an OLAP database more aggregations are used.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Predictive Analysis</h2>
<p>Predictive analysis is known as finding the hidden patterns in data stored in DW system by using different mathematical functions to predict future outcomes.</p>
<p>Predictive Analysis system is different from an OLAP system in terms of its use. It is used to focus on future outcomes. An OALP system focuses on current and historical data processing for analytical reporting.</p>
<h1>DW - Products &amp; Vendor</h1>
<p>There are various Data Warehouse/database systems available in the market that meet the capabilities of a DW system. The most common vendors for data warehouse systems are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li>Oracle Exadata</li>
<li>IBM Netezza</li>
<li>Teradata</li>
<li>Sybase IQ</li>
<li>SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW)</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP Business Warehouse</h2>
<p><b>SAP Business Warehouse</b> is a part of SAP NetWeaver release platform. Prior to NetWeaver 7.4, it was referred to as SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse.</p>
<p>Data warehousing in SAP BW means data integration, transformation, data cleansing, storing and data staging. DW process includes data modeling in BW system, staging and administration. The main tool, which is used to manage DW tasks in BW system, is the administration workbench.</p>

<h1>ETL - Introduction</h1>
<p>ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. An ETL tool extracts the data from different RDBMS source systems, transforms the data like applying calculations, concatenate, etc. and then load the data to Data Warehouse system. The data is loaded in the DW system in the form of dimension and fact tables.</p>
<h2>Extraction</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A staging area is required during ETL load. There are various reasons why staging area is required.</p></li>
<li><p>The source systems are only available for specific period of time to extract data. This period of time is less than the total data-load time. Therefore, staging area allows you to extract the data from the source system and keeps it in the staging area before the time slot ends.</p></li>
<li><p>Staging area is required when you want to get the data from multiple data sources together or if you want to join two or more systems together. For example, you will not be able to perform a SQL query joining two tables from two physically different databases.</p></li>
<li><p>Data extractions’ time slot for different systems vary as per the time zone and operational hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Data extracted from source systems can be used in multiple data warehouse system, Operation Data stores, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>ETL allows you to perform complex transformations and requires extra area to store the data.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/etl_extraction.jpg" alt="ETL Extraction" />
<h2>Transform</h2>
<p>In data transformation, you apply a set of functions on extracted data to load it into the target system. Data, which does not require any transformation is known as direct move or pass through data.</p>
<p>You can apply different transformations on extracted data from the source system. For example, you can perform customized calculations. If you want sum-of-sales revenue and this is not in database, you can apply the <b>SUM</b> formula during transformation and load the data.</p>
<p>For example, if you have the first name and the last name in a table in different columns, you can use concatenate before loading.</p>
<h2>Load</h2>
<p>During Load phase, data is loaded into the end-target system and it can be a flat file or a Data Warehouse system.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP BO Data Services is an ETL tool used for Data integration, data quality, data profiling and data processing. It allows you to integrate, transform trusted data-to-data warehouse system for analytical reporting.</p>

<p>SAP Business Objects Data Services includes different components like Data Service Designer, Data Services Management Console, Repository Manager, Data Services Server Manager, Work bench, etc. The target system can be a DW system like SAP HANA, SAP BW or a non-SAP Data warehouse system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/sap_bods_source_layer.jpg" alt="SAP BODS Source Layer" />
<p>The following screenshot shows the different components of SAP BODS.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/sap_bods_components.jpg" alt="SAP BODS Components" />
<p>You can also divide BODS architecture in the following layers &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Web Application Layer</li>
<li>Database Server Layer</li>
<li>Data Services Service Layer</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows the BODS architecture.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/bods_architecture.jpg" alt="BODS Architecture" />
<h2>Product Evolution – ATL, DI &amp; DQ</h2>
<p>Acta Technology Inc. developed SAP Business Objects Data Services and later Business Objects Company acquired it. Acta Technology Inc. is a US based company and was responsible for development of first-data integration platform. The two ETL software products developed by Acta Inc. was the <b>Data Integration (DI)</b> tool and the <b>Data Management</b> or <b>Data Quality</b> (<b>DQ</b>) tool.</p>
<p>Business Objects, a French company acquired Acta Technology Inc. in 2002 and later, both the products were renamed as <b>Business Objects Data Integration (BODI)</b> tool and <b>Business Objects Data Quality (BODQ)</b> tool.</p>
<p>SAP acquired Business Objects in 2007 and both the products were renamed as SAP BODI and SAP BODQ. In 2008, SAP integrated both the products into single software product named as SAP Business Objects Data Services (BODS).</p>
<p>SAP BODS provides data integration and data management solution and in the earlier version of BODS, the text data-processing solution was included.</p>
<h2>BODS – Objects</h2>
<p>All the entities that are used in BO Data Services Designer are called <b>Objects</b>. All the objects like projects, jobs, metadata and system functions are stored in the local object library. All the objects are hierarchical in nature.</p>
<p>The objects mainly contain the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Properties</b> &minus; They are used to describe an object and do not affect its operation. Example &minus; Name of an object, Date when it is created, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Options</b> &minus; Which control the operation of objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Objects</h3>
<p>There are two types of objects in the system &minus; Reusable objects and Single Use objects. The type of object determines how that object is used and retrieved.</p>
<p><b>Reusable Objects</b></p>
<p>Most of the objects that are stored in the repository can be reused. When a reusable object is defined and saved in the local repository, you can reuse the object by creating Calls to the definition. Each reusable object has only one definition and all the calls to that object refer to that definition. Now, if definition of an object is changed at one place you are changing the object definition at all the places where that object appears.</p>
<p>An object library is used to contain object definition and when an object is dragged and dropped from library, a new reference to an existing object is created.</p>
<p><b>Single Use Objects</b></p>
<p>All the objects that are defined specifically to a job or data flow are known as single use objects. For example, specific transformation used in any data load.</p>
<h2>BODS – Object Hierarchy</h2>
<p>All the objects are hierarchical in nature. The following diagram shows the object hierarchy in SAP BODS system &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/object_hierarchy.jpg" alt="Object Hierarchy" />
<h2>BODS – Tools &amp; Functions</h2>
<p>Based on the architecture illustrated below, we have many tools defined in SAP Business Objects Data Services. Each tool has its own function as per system landscape.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/tools_and_functions.jpg" alt="Tools and Functions" />
<p>At the top, you have Information Platform Services installed for users and rights security management. BODS depends on Central Management console (<b>CMC</b>) for user access and security feature. This is applicable to the 4.x version. In the previous version, it was done in Management Console.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Data Services Designer</h1>
<p>Data Services Designer is a developer tool, which is used to create objects consisting of data mapping, transformation, and logic. It is GUI based and works as a designer for Data Services.</p>
<h2>Repository</h2>
<p>Repository is used to store metadata of objects used in BO Data Services. Each Repository should be registered in Central Management Console and is linked with single or many job servers, which are responsible for executing jobs that are created by you.</p>
<h3>Types of Repositories</h3>
<p>There are three types of Repositories.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Local Repository</b> &minus; It is used to store the metadata of all objects created in Data Services Designer like projects, jobs, data flow, work flow, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Central Repository</b> &minus; It is used to control the version management of the objects and is used for multiuse development. Central Repository stores all the versions of an application object. Hence, it allows you to move to previous versions.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Profiler Repository</b> &minus; This is used to manage all the metadata related to profiler tasks performed in SAP BODS designer. CMS Repository stores metadata of all the tasks performed in CMC on BI platform. Information Steward Repository stores all the metadata of profiling tasks and objects created in information steward.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Job Server</h3>
<p>Job server is used to execute the real time and batch jobs created by you. It gets the job information from respective repositories and initiates the data engine to execute the job. Job server can execute the real time or scheduled jobs and uses multithreading in memory caching, and parallel processing to provide performance optimization.</p>
<h3>Access Server</h3>
<p>Access Server in Data Services is known as real time message broker system, which takes the message requests, moves to real time service and displays a message in specific time frame.</p>
<h3>Data Service Management Console</h3>
<p>Data Service Management Console is used to perform administration activities like scheduling the jobs, generating the quality reports in DS system, data validation, documentation etc.</p>
<h2>BODS – Naming Standards</h2>
<p>It is advisable to use standard naming conventions for all the objects in all systems as this allows you to identify objects in Repositories easily.</p>
<p>The table shows the list of recommended naming conventions that should be used for all jobs and other objects.</p>

<h1>SAP BODS - Memory Datastore</h1>
<p>You can create a Datastore using memory as the database type. Memory Datastores are used to improve the performance of data flows in real time jobs as it stores the data in the memory to facilitate quick access and does not require to go to original data source.</p>
<p>A memory Datastore is used to store memory table schemas in the repository. These memory tables get data from tables in Relational database or using hierarchical data files like XML message and IDocs. The memory tables remain alive until the job is executed and the data in memory tables cannot be shared between different real time jobs.</p>

<h1>SAP BODS - Linked Datastore</h1>
<p>There are various database vendors, which only provide one-way communication path from one database to another database. These paths are known as database links. In SQL Server, Linked server allows one-way communication path from one database to other.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider a local database Server named <b>“Product”</b> stores database link to access information on remote database server called <b>Customer</b>. Now, users that are connected to the remote database server Customer cannot use the same link to access data in database server Product. Users that are connected to <b>“Customer”</b> should have a separate link in data dictionary of the server to access the data in Product database server.</p>
<p>This communication path between the two databases is called the database link. The Datastores, which are created between these linked database relationships are known as linked Datastores.</p>
<p>There is a possibility of connecting one Datastore to another Datastore and importing an external database link as option of Datastore.</p>

<h1>SAP BODS - Workflow Introduction</h1>
<p>Workflows are used to determine the process for execution. The main purpose of workflow is to prepare for executing the data flows and to set the state of system, once the data flow execution is completed.</p>
<p>The Batch jobs in ETL projects are similar to the Workflows with the only difference that the job does not have parameters.</p>
<p>Various objects can be added to a work flow. They are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Work flow</li>
<li>Data flow</li>
<li>Scripts</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Conditions</li>
<li>Try or Catch Blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also make a work flow call other work flow or a work flow can call itself.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In workflow, steps are executed in a left to right sequence.</p>
<h2>Example of Work Flow</h2>
<p>Suppose there is a fact table that you want to update and you have created a data flow with the transformation. Now, if you want to move the data from source system, you have to check the last modification for fact table so that you extract only rows that are added after last update.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, you have to create one script, which determines the last update date and then pass this as input parameter to the data flow.</p>
<p>You also have to check if the data connection to a particular fact table is active or not. If it is not active, you need to setup a catch block, which automatically sends an email to the administrator to notify about this problem.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Creating Workflows</h1>
<p>Workflows can be created using the following methods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Object Library</li>
<li>Tool Palette</li>

</ul>
<h2>Text Data Processing</h2>
<p>Text Data Processing allows you to process large volume of text data.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Adding Transform to a Dataflow</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you will see how to add <b>Transform</b> to a Data Flow.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to Object Library &rarr; Transform tab.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/transform_tab.jpg" alt="Transform Tab" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Select the Transform that you want to add to the data flow. If you add a transformation that has option to select configuration, a prompt will open.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Draw the data flow connection to connect the source to a transform.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Double click the Transformation name to open the transformation editor.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/transformation_editor.jpg" alt="Transformation Editor" />
<p>Once the definition is complete, click <b>OK</b> to close the editor.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Query Transform</h1>
<p>This is the most common transformation used in Data Services and you can perform the following functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Data filtering from sources</li>
<li>Joining data from multiple sources</li>
<li>Perform functions and transformations on data</li>
<li>Column mapping from input to output schemas</li>
<li>Assigning Primary keys</li>
<li>Add new columns, schemas and functions resulted to output schemas</li>
</ul>
<p>As Query transformation is the most commonly used transformation, a shortcut is provided for this query in the tool palette.</p>
<p>To add Query transform, follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Click the query-transformation tool palette. Click anywhere on the Data flow workspace. Connect this to the inputs and outputs.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/connect_inputs_outputs.jpg" alt="Connect Inputs Outputs" />
<p>When you double click the Query transform icon, it opens a Query editor that is used to perform query operations.</p>
<p>The following areas are present in Query transform &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Input Schema</li>
<li>Output Schema</li>
<li>Parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>The Input and Output schemas contain Columns, Nested Schemas and Functions. Schema In and Schema Out shows the currently selected schema in transformation.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/input_output_schemas.jpg" alt="Input Output Schemas" />
<p>To change the output schema, select the schema in the list, right click and select Make Current.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/change_output_schema.jpg" alt="Change Output Schema" />
<h2>Data Quality Transform</h2>
<p>Data Quality Transformations cannot be directly connected to the upstream transform, which contains nested tables. To connect these transform you should add a query transform or XML pipeline transform between transformation from nested table and data quality transform.</p>
<h3>How to use Data Quality Transformation?</h3>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to Object Library &rarr; Transform tab</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/library_transform_tab.jpg" alt="Library Transform Tab" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Expand the Data Quality transform and add the transform or transform configuration you want to add to data flow.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Draw the data flow connections. Double click the name of the transform, it opens the transform editor. In input schema, select the input fields that you want to map.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; To use Associate Transform, you can add user defined fields to input tab.</p>
<h2>Text Data Processing Transform</h2>
<p>Text Data Processing Transform allows you to extract the specific information from large volume of text. You can search for facts and entities like customer, product, and financial facts, specific to an organization.</p>
<p>This transform also checks the relationship between entities and allows the extraction. The data extracted, using text data processing, can be used in Business Intelligence, Reporting, query, and analytics.</p>
<h2>Entity Extraction Transform</h2>
<p>In Data Services, text data processing is done with the help of Entity Extraction, which extracts entities and facts from unstructured data.</p>
<p>This involves analyzing and processing large volume of text data, searching entities, assigning them to appropriate type and presenting metadata in standard format.</p>
<p>The Entity Extraction transform can extract information from any text, HTML, XML, or certain binary-format (such as PDF) content and generate structured output. You can use the output in several ways based on your work flow. You can use it as an input to another transform or write to multiple output sources such as a database table or a flat file. The output is generated in UTF-16 encoding.</p>
<p><b>Entity Extract Transform can be used in the following scenarios &minus;</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Finding a specific information from large amount of text volume.</li>
<li>Finding structured information from unstructured text with existing information to make new connections.</li>
<li>Reporting and analysis for product quality.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Differences between TDP and Data Cleansing</h2>
<p>Text data processing is used for finding relevant information from unstructured text data. However, data cleansing is used for standardization and cleansing structured data.</p>

<h1>SAP BODS - Data Services Overview</h1>
<p>Data Services administration includes creating real time and batch jobs, scheduling jobs, embedded data flow, variables and parameters, recovery mechanism, data profiling, Performance tuning, etc.</p>
<h2>Real Time Jobs</h2>
<p>You can create real time jobs to process real time messages in Data Services designer. Like a batch job, real time job extracts the data, transforms and loads it.</p>
<p>Each real time job can extract data from a single message. You can also extract data from other sources like tables or files.</p>
<p>Real time jobs are not executed with the help of triggers unlike batch jobs. They are executed as real time services by administrators. Real time services wait for messages from access server. Access server receives this message and passes it to real time services, which is configured to process the message type. Real time services execute the message and returns the result and continues to process the messages until they get an instruction to stop executing.</p>
<h2>Real Time vs Batch Jobs</h2>
<p>Transforms like the branches and control logic are used more often in real time job, which is not the case with batch jobs in designer.</p>
<p>Real time jobs are not executed in response of a schedule or internal trigger unlike the batch jobs.</p>
<h2>Creating Real Time Jobs</h2>
<p>Real time jobs can be created using same objects like data flows, work flows, loops, conditionals, scripts, etc.</p>
<p>You can use the following data models for creating real time jobs &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Single data flow model</li>
<li>Multiple data flow model</li>
</ul>
<h3>Single data flow model</h3>
<p>You can create a real time job with single data flow in its real time processing loop and it includes a single message source and single message target.</p>
<p><b>Creating Real Time job using single data model &minus;</b></p>
<p>To create Real Time job using single data model, follow the given steps.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to Data Services Designer &rarr; Project New &rarr; Project &rarr; Enter the Project Name</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/services_designer.jpg" alt="Services Designer" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Right click on the white space in Project area &rarr; New Real time job.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/real_time_job.jpg" alt="Real Time Job" />
<p>Workspace shows two components of Real time job &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>RT_Process_begins</li>
<li>Step_ends</li>
</ul>
<p>It shows the beginning and the end of real time job.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/beginning_and_end.jpg" alt="Beginning and End" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; To create a real time job with single data flow, select data flow from the tool palette on the right pane and drag it to the work space.</p>
<p>Click inside the loop, you can use one message source and one message target in real time processing loop. Connect the starting and the end marks to the data flow.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/real_time_loop.jpg" alt="Real Time Loop" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Add configure objects in data flow as required and save the job.</p>
<h3>Multiple data flow model</h3>
<p>This allows you to create a real time job with multiple data flow in its real time processing loop. You also need to ensure that the data in each data model is fully processed before it moves to the next message.</p>
<h2>Testing Real Time Jobs</h2>
<p>You can test the real time job by passing the sample message as source message from the file. You can check if the Data Services generate the expected target message.</p>
<p>To ensure that your job gives you the expected result, you can execute the job in view data mode. Using this mode, you can capture output data to make sure that your real time job is working fine.</p>
<h2>Embedded Data Flows</h2>
<p>Embedded data flow is known as data flows, which are called from another data flow in the design. The embedded data flow can contain multiple number of source and targets but only one input or output pass data to main data flow.</p>
<p>The following types of embedded data flows can be used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>One Input</b> &minus; Embedded data flow is added at the end of dataflow.</p></li>
<li><p><b>One Output</b> &minus; Embedded data flow is added at the beginning of a data flow.</p></li>
<li><p><b>No input or output</b> &minus; Replicate an existing data flow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Embedded data flow can be used for the following purpose &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>To simplify the data flow display.</li>
<li>If you want to save the flow logic and reuse it in other data flows.</li>
<li>For debugging, wherein you create sections of data flow as embedded data flow and execute them separately.</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/embedded_data_flow.jpg" alt="Embedded Data Flow" />
<h1>SAP BODS - Creating Embedded Dataflow</h1>

<p>Right click on the object and select to make it Embedded Data flow.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/make_embedded_dataflow.jpg" alt="Make Embedded Data Flow" />
<h2>Option 2</h2>
<p>Drag the complete and validate data flow from object library into an open data flow in the work space. Next, open the data flow that has been created. Select the object you want to use as the input and output port and click <b>make port</b> for that object.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/click_make_port.jpg" alt="Click Make Port" />
<p>Data Services add that object as connection point for embedded data flow.</p>
<h2>Variables and Parameters</h2>
<p>You can use local and global variables with data flow and work flow, which provide more flexibility in designing jobs.</p>
<p>The key features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Data type of a variable can be a number, integer, decimal, date or a text string like character.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables can be used in the data flows and work flows as function in the <b>Where</b> clause.</p></li>
<li><p>Local variables in data services are restricted to object in which they are created.</p></li>
<li><p>Global variables are restricted to jobs in which they are created. Using global variables, you can change values for default global variables at run time.</p></li>
<li><p>Expressions that are used in work flow and data flow are known as <b>parameters</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>All the variables and parameters in work flow and data flows are shown in variable and parameters window.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To view variables and parameters, follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<p>Go to Tools &rarr; Variables.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/variables_and_parameters.jpg" alt="Variables and Parameters" />
<p>A new window <b>Variables and parameters</b> is displayed. It has two tabs &minus; Definitions and Calls.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/definitions_and_calls.jpg" alt="Definitions and Calls" />
<p>The <b>Definitions</b> tab allows you to create and view variables and parameters. You can use local variables and parameters at work flow and data flow level. Global variables can be used at job level.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="width:18%;vertical-align:middle;">Job</td>
<td style="width:25%"><p>Local variables</p>
<p>Global variables</p>
</td>
<td><p>A script or conditional in the job</p>

<p>Parent objects to pass local variables. Work flows may also return variables or parameters to parent objects.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data flow</td>
<td>Parameters</td>
<td>A WHERE clause, column mapping, or a function in the dataflow. Data flow. Data flows cannot return output values.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the call tab, you can see the name of the parameter defined for all objects in a parent object’s definition.</p>
<h2>Defining Local Variable</h2>
<p>To define the Local Variable, Open the Real time job.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to Tools &rarr; Variables. A new <b>Variables and Parameters</b> window will open.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Go to Variable &rarr; Right click &rarr; Insert</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/variable_insert.jpg" alt="Variable Insert" />
<p>It will create a new parameter <b>$NewVariable0</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Enter the name of the new variable. Select the data type from the list.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/select_datatype.jpg" alt="Select Datatype" />
<p>Once it is defined, close the window. In a similar way, you can define the parameters for data flow and work flow.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/dataflow_and_workflow.jpg" alt="Dataflow and Workflow" />
<h1>Debugging &amp; Recovery Mechanism</h1>
<p>In case your job does not run successfully, you should fix the error and rerun the job. In case of failed jobs, there is a possibility that some tables have been loaded, altered or partially loaded. You need to rerun the job to get all the data and to remove any duplicate or missing data.</p>
<p>Two techniques that can be used for recovery are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Automatic Recovery</b> &minus; This allows you to run unsuccessful jobs in recovery mode.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Manually Recovery</b> &minus; This allows you to rerun the jobs without considering partial rerun previous time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>To run a job with Recovery option enabled in Designer</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Right Click on job name &rarr; Execute.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/click_job_name.jpg" alt="Click Job Name" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Save all changes and Execute &rarr; Yes.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Go to the Execution tab &rarr; Enable Recovery check box. If this box is not checked, Data services will not recover the job, if it fails.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/enable_recovery_checkbox.jpg" alt="Enable Recovery Checkbox" />
<p><b>To run a job in Recovery mode from Designer</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Right click and execute the job as above. Save changes.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Go to the Execution Options. You have to ensure that the option <b>Recover from last failed execution</b> box is checked.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; This option is not enabled, if a job is not yet executed. This is known as Automatic recovery of a failed job.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/automatic_recovery.jpg" alt="Automatic Recovery" />
<h1>Data Assessment &amp; Data Profiling</h1>
<p>Data Services Designer provides a feature of Data Profiling to ensure and improve the quality and structure of source data.</p>
<p>Data Profiler allows you to &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Find anomalies in source data, validation and corrective action and quality of source data.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the structure and relationship of source data for better execution of jobs, work flows and data flows.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the content of source and target system to determine that your job returns an expected result.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you are connected, a list of profiler repositories will be displayed. Select <b>Repository</b> and click <b>Connect</b>.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Tuning Techniques</h1>
<p>The performance of an ETL job depends on the system on which you are using Data Services software, number of moves, etc.</p>
<p>There are various other factors that contribute to the performance in an ETL task. They are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Source Data Base</b> &minus; Source database should be set to perform the <b>Select</b> statements quickly. This can be done by increasing the size of database I/O, increasing the size of the shared buffer to cache more data and not allowing parallel for small tables, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Source Operating System</b> &minus; Source Operating System should be configured to read the data quickly from the disks. Set the read ahead protocol to 64KB.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Target Database</b> &minus; Target Database must be configured to perform <b>INSERT</b> and <b>UPDATE</b> quickly. This can be done by &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Disabling the Archive logging.</li>
<li>Disabling the Redo logging for all tables.</li>
<li>Maximizing the size of the shared buffer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><b>Target Operating System</b> &minus; Target Operating System has to be configured in order to write the data to the disks quickly. You can turn on asynchronous I/O to make the Input/output operations as fast as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Network</b> &minus; Network bandwidth should be enough to transfer the data from source to target system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>BODS Repository Database</b> &minus; To improve the performance of BODS jobs, the following can be performed &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Monitor Sample Rate</b> &minus; In case you are processing a large amount of data set in an ETL job, monitor Sample Rate to a higher value to reduce the number of I/O calls to the log file thereby improving the performance.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also exclude the Data Services logs from the virus scan if the virus scan is configured on the job server as it can cause a performance degradation</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Job Server OS</b> &minus; In Data Services, one data flow in a job initiates one <b>‘al_engine’</b> process, which initiates four threads. For maximum performance, consider a design that runs one <b>‘al_engine’</b> process per CPU at a time. The Job Server OS should be tuned in such a way that all the threads are spread to all the available CPUs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP BODS - Central vs Local Repository</h1>
<p>SAP BO Data Services support multiuser development where each user can work on an application in their own local repository. Each team uses central repository to save the main copy of an application and all the versions of the objects in the application.</p>
<p>The key features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In SAP Data Services, you can create a central repository for storing team copy of an application. It contains all the information that is also available in local repository. However, it just provides a storage location for the object information. To make any changes, you should need to work in local repository.</p></li>
<li><p>You can copy objects from central repository to local repository. However, if you have to make any changes, you need to check out that object in central repository. Due to this, the other users cannot check out that object in central repository and hence, they cannot make changes to the same object.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you make the changes to the object, you need to check in for the object. It allows Data Services to save new modified object in central repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Services allow multiple user with local repositories to connect to the central repository at the same time but only one user can check out and make changes to a specific object.</p></li>
<li><p>The central repository also maintains the history of each object. It allows you to revert to the previous version of an object, if the changes do not result as required.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Multiple Users</h2>
<p>SAP BO Data Services allow multiple users to work on the same application at the same time. The following terms should be considered in a multi-user environment &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;width:28%;">Highest level object</td>
<td>The highest level object is the object that is not a dependent of any object in the object hierarchy. For example, if Job 1 is comprised of Work Flow 1 and Data Flow 1, then Job 1 is the highest level object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Object dependents</td>
<td>Object dependents are objects associated beneath the highest level object in the hierarchy. For example, if Job 1 is comprised of Work Flow 1 which contains Data Flow 1, then both Work Flow 1 and Data Flow 1 are dependents of Job 1. Further, Data Flow 1 is a dependent of Work Flow 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;">Object version</td>
<td>An object version is an instance of an object. Each time you add or check in an object to the central repository, the software creates a new version of the object. The latest version of an object is the last or most recent version created.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>To update the local repository in multiuser environment, you can get the latest copy of each object from central repository. To edit an object, you can use check out and check in option.</p>
<h1>SAP BODS - Central Repository Security</h1>
<p>There are various security parameters that can be applied on a central repository to make it secure.</p>
<p>Various security parameters are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Authentication</b> &minus; This allows only authentic users to log in to the central repository.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Authorization</b> &minus; This allows the user to assign different level of permissions for each object.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Auditing</b> &minus; This is used to maintain the history of all the changes made to an object. You can check all the previous versions and revert to the older versions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Non Secure Central Repository</h2>
<p>In a multiuser development environment, it is always advisable to work in central repository method.</p>
<p>To create a non-secure central repository follow the given steps &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Create a database, using database management system, which will act as a central repository.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Go to a Repository Manager.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/repository_manager.jpg" alt="Repository Manager" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Select the Repository type as Central. Enter the database details such as User Name and Password and click <b>Create</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/repository_type.jpg" alt="Repository Type" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; To define a connection to the Central Repository, <b>Tools &rarr; Central Repository</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/central_repository.jpg" alt="Central Repository" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Select the Repository in Central Repository connection and click the <b>Add</b> icon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/central_repository_connections.jpg" alt="Central Repository Connections" />
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Enter the password for the central repository and click the <b>Activate</b> button.</p>
<h2>Creating a Secure Central Repository</h2>
<p>To create a secure Central Repository, go to the Repository Manager. Select the Repository Type as Central. Click the <b>Enable Security</b> Check box.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_bods/images/secure_central_repository.jpg" alt="Secure Central Repository" />
<h1>Creating a Multi-user Environment</h1>
<p>For a successful development in the multiuser environment, it is advisable to implement some processes like check in and check out.</p>
<p>You can use the following processes in a multiuser environment &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Filtering</li>
<li>Checking out objects</li>
<li>Undoing check out</li>
<li>Checking in Objects</li>
<li>Labelling Objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Filtering is applicable when you add any objects, check in, check out and label objects to the central repository.</p>
<h2>Migrating Multiuser Jobs</h2>
<p>In SAP Data Services, job migration can be applied at different levels i.e. Application Level, Repository Level, Upgrade level.</p>
<p>You cannot copy the content of one central repository to other central repository directly; you need to make use of local repository.</p>
<p>The first step is to get the latest version of all objects from the central repository to the local repository. Activate the central repository in which you want to copy the contents. Add all the objects you want to copy from the local repository to the central repository.</p>
<h2>Central Repository Migration</h2>
<p>If you update the version of SAP Data Services, you need to update the version of Repository also.</p>
<p>The following points should be considered when migrating a central repository to upgrade the version &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Take a backup of the central repository of all tables and objects.</p></li>
<li><p>To maintain the version of objects in data services, maintain a central repository for each version. Create a new central history with new version of Data Services software and copy all the objects to this repository.</p></li>
<li><p>If you install a new version of Data Services, it is always recommended, you should upgrade your central repository to a new version of objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade your local repository to the same version, as different versions of the central and the local repository may not work at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Before migrating the central repository, check in all the objects. As you do not upgrade central and local repository simultaneously, so there is a need to check in all the objects. Once you have your central repository upgraded to a newer version, you will not be able to check in objects from the local repository, which has an older version of the Data Services.</p></li>
