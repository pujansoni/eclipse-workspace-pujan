<h1>SAP PI - Introduction</h1>
<p>SAP Process Integration is a part of the SAP NetWeaver platform. It is called SAP NetWeaver Exchange Infrastructure XI in NetWeaver 7.0 ehp2 and older versions. SAP NetWeaver Process Integration is a part of the NetWeaver software component and is used for exchange of information in company’s internal system or with external parties.</p>
<p>SAP PI/XI enables you to set up cross system communication and integration and allows you to connect SAP and non-SAP systems based on different programming language like Java and SAP ABAP. It provides an open source environment that is necessary in complex system landscape for the integration of systems and for communication.</p>
<p>SAP Process Integration is a middleware to allow seamless integration between SAP and non-SAP application in a company or with systems outside the company.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>An application that is run on different systems that are part of different business units in a company or implemented in a distributed environment between different companies that have a business relationship with each other. In this environment, there is a need for seamless integration and transfer of information between different systems. SAP PI provides a middleware platform that doesn’t deal with how application components are implemented with a business logic and focuses more on data exchange between the different components.</p>
<p>You can consider SAP PI as a central instance or middleware that interconnects different systems. This middleware can be referred as SAP PI runtime engine and this communication is called mediated communication. When you compare this communication with a point to point scenario, it is easy to manage the systems and connections. In addition to all this, information related to integration is available at one central point.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/sap_pi_communication.jpg" alt="SAP PI Communication" />
<p>The message exchange between the different systems using SAP PI contains business data. The communication message protocol is based on W3C standard SOAP messages.</p>
<h2>Why do We Need SAP PI?</h2>
<p>In an organization, SAP ERP doesn’t contain a single system but consists of a number of integrated systems like SAP CRM, FICO, EWM, etc. SAP PI provides a platform as single point of integration for all systems without touching complex legacy system for all data and information exchange.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/need_of_sap_pi.jpg" alt="Need of SAP PI" />
<p>The following are the key capabilities provided by SAP Process Integration &minus;</p>
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p>Using SAP PI, you can connect different applications and systems that have different technical ways of communication. SAP PI provides you with a variety of adapters that allow you to connect applications based on different protocols like HTTPS or Remote Function Call (RFC).</p>
<h3>Routing</h3>
<p>Routing defines the rules for flow of messages between different systems at runtime.</p>
<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>SAP PI is used to connect different applications or systems in a distributed environment that can be set up between different companies, so there is a possibility that the structure of data exchange between two components differs from each other.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/mapping.jpg" alt="Mapping" />
<p>Mapping determines the structure of data in a source system to structure of data in a target system. It also determines the conversion rules that are applied to the data between source and target system.</p>
<h1>SAP PI - Installation Options</h1>
<p>When you run a scenario in SAP PI, the communication and processing capabilities depend on runtime engines that are installed with the installation of SAP PI. You can install one or more runtime engines on a host system. SAP PI provides the following two installation options &minus;</p>
<h2>Type 1 — Dual Usage Type</h2>
<p>This installation is based on ABAP and Java and provides tools for designing and configuring integration content and also these runtime engines &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Integration Engine</li>
<li>Business Process Engine</li>
<li>Advanced Adapter Engine</li>
</ul>
<h2>Type 2 — Advance Adapter Engine Extended AEX</h2>
<p>This installation is based on Java and provides tools for designing and configuring integration content and contains Advance adapter engine as runtime engine.</p>
<h1>SAP PI - Netweaver PI Architecture</h1>
<p>SAP PI architecture consists of multiple components which are used at design time, configuration time and runtime. In SAP PI, the sender system is known as the source and the receiver is called the target system and the architecture is known as <b>Hub and Spoke structure</b>. The Spoke is used to connect with external systems and Hub is used to exchange messages.</p>
<p><b>A SAP PI system is divided into the following components</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Integration Server</li>
<li>Integration Builder</li>
<li>System Landscape Directory SLD</li>
<li>Configuration and Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/sap_pi_architecture.jpg" alt="SAP PI Architecture" />
<h2>Runtime Workbench</h2>
<p>This is a tool used to provide central monitoring of PI components and messages.</p>
<h2>Integration Server</h2>
<p>This is one of the key components of the SAP PI system and is used for processing of messages.</p>
<p>It consists of the following three engines &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Business Process Engine</li>
<li>Integration Engine</li>
<li>Central Advanced Adapter Engine AAE</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business Process Engine</h2>
<p>This engine is used for message correlation and deals with the processing of messages in ccBPM.</p>
<h2>Integration Engine</h2>
<p>This engine is used for routing and mapping and provides central integration server services. If the source structure is different from the target structure, the integration engine calls mapping runtime as shown in the illustration below wherein, the source structure is converted to target structure.</p>
<p>A mapping runtime is based on Java Stack as mentioned under the SAP PI platform topic.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/integration_engine.jpg" alt="Integration Engine" />
<p>A message can be of the following two types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Synchronous message</b> is defined as message contains both the request-response part</p></li>
<li><p><b>Asynchronous message</b> is defined as message contains either request or the response part only</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In SAP PI, a message is represented by an interface. An Interface contains the structure of the message in XML format and the direction.</p>
<h2>Central Advanced Adapter Engine (AAE)</h2>
<p>As Integration Engine handles messages in XML and SOAP protocol, if the business system doesn’t contain data in a specific format, adapters are used to convert the messages specific protocol and message format required by the Integration Engine.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/aae.jpg" alt="AAE" />
<p>In SAP PI architecture, you can consider Adapter Engine as Spoke and Integration Engine as HUB to connect to external systems.</p>
<p>In SAP PI older releases dual stack system, most of the adapters were part of Java stack and only two adapters were part of ABAP stack.</p>
<h2>Java Stack Adapters</h2>
<p>The following adapters run on Java Stack &minus;</p>
<p>RFC adapter, SAP Business Connector adapter, file/FTP adapter, JDBC adapter, JMS adapter, SOAP adapter, Marketplace Adapter, Mail adapter, RNIF adapter, CIDX adapter</p>
<h2>ABAP Stack Adapters</h2>
<p>The following adapters run on ABAP Stack &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>Sr.No</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">ABAP Stack Adapter &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><p><b>IDOC and HTTP Adapter</b></p>
<p>In the latest releases when SAP PI moved to the single stack system, these two adapters also moved to the Java stack and the new engine thus formed is known as Advanced Adapter Engine AAE.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><p><b>Service Repository</b></p>
<p>Services Registry is a UDDI complaint registry, listing available Web Service Definitions (based on WSDL), extended with a classification system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><p><b>Enterprise Service Repository</b></p>
<p>This is used to store design time repository objects like mapping, interfaces and process definitions in the PI system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><p><b>System Landscape Directory (SLD)</b></p>
<p>This contains the information about landscape and software component versions. A SAP system can be configured to register under SLD.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><p><b>Integration Repository</b></p><p>This is used to configure the scenarios in PI system for exchange of messages between different systems.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h1>SAP PI - UI Tools</h1>
<p>You can use different SAP PI user interface tools to access different components of SAP PI system architecture. The most common UI tools are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>ES Builder</b> &minus; This tool provides Java user interface for working in Enterprise Service Repository ESR.</p></li>
<li><p><b>SAP NW Developer Studio</b> &minus; This is Java Eclipse-based tool to view and edit some object types in Enterprise Service Repository.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integration Builder</b> &minus; This tool provides Java-based user interface to work in the Integration Directory.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP GUI</h2>
<p>This is SAP client tool to access ABAP stack of the SAP PI system.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the different UI tools of SAP PI and the components that can be accessed using these tools &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/sap_gui.jpg" alt="SAP GUI" />
<h2>SAP PI — Platform</h2>
<h3>Single Stack Vs Dual Stack</h3>
<p>In SAP PI older releases, not all the components were based on a single platform. Few components like Integration Engine, Business Process Engine and Integration Builder were based on ABAP stack and other components like Enterprise Service Repository ESR, Integration Directory (SLD, Adapter Engine, etc.) were based on Java Stack. So these type of systems were called dual stack systems as PI required both ABAP and Java stack to run.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;" >
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:50%">ABAP Stack</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Java Stack</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Integration Engine</td>
<td>Enterprise Service Repository ESR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Business Process Engine</td>
<td>Integration Directory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle">Integration Builder</td>
<td>(Runtime Workbench, System Landscape, Adapter Engine, Mapping Runtime)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the latest releases of SAP PI, ABAP stack components are modified to work on Java stack so, SAP PI needs only Java stack to run and is called the single stack system.</p>
<h1>SAP PI - Home Page</h1>
<p>To open SAP PI Tools home page, use the following URL &minus;</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%;"><b>http://&lt;host&gt;:5&lt;instance#&gt;00/dir/start/index.jsp</b></p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; http://scmehp2:50200/dir/start/index.jsp</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/sap_pi_tab.jpg" alt="SAP PI Tab" />
<p>SAP PI home page has the following four Java links &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Enterprise Services Repository (ESR)</li>
<li>Integration Directory (ID)</li>
<li>System Landscape (SL)</li>
<li>Configuration and Monitoring (CM)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enterprise Services Repository (ESR)</h2>
<p>In SAP PI, Enterprise Service Repository is used to design and create objects to be used in the integration scenario. You can design Interface Objects, Mapping Objects and the different integration processes.</p>
<h3>Interface Objects</h3>
<p>The following are the Interface Objects &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Service Interface</li>

<h1>SAP PI - Communication</h1>
<p>In SAP PI, you can define two types of communication — <b>Synchronous</b> and <b>Asynchronous</b>.</p>
<h2>Synchronous Communication</h2>
<p>Synchronous communication is invoked by request and response operation and process output is returned immediately after the operation. In general terms, you can say that a synchronous scenario is when a sender process sends a request to the receiver and waits for a response. If an error occurs at the receiver side, the sender application is responsible for sending the message again.</p>
<p>In this approach, there is a possibility that the sender might resend the message after time out and a duplicate message may exist. This approach in PI is known as <b>BE (Best Effort)</b>.</p>
<p>Consider two systems – <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. And, you introduce an intermediate system I between the two systems. Communication between System A and System I is synchronous and System A and System B is asynchronous.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/synchronous_communication.jpg" alt="Synchronous Communication" />
<p>The following types of errors can occur in this communication scenario &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Application Error</b> &minus; There is an error at the receiver end while processing a message and the sender is not aware about this error and keeps waiting for the reply.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Network level Error</b> &minus; In this error, there is an error in communication network between the sender and the receiver. Sender is not aware about this and the message is stuck in between and the sender waits till the operation timeout.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/errors.jpg" alt="Errors" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Error in Response Message</b> &minus; In this scenario, an error occurs and the response message gets stuck in between and sender keeps on waiting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>The following are the key advantages of using Synchronous Communication &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>There is no need to configure response message routing.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no need to correlate response to a request.</p></li>
<li><p>In this communication, response is received immediately.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommended Scenario</h3>
<p>This is suitable for operations that involve read operations, for example, viewing a purchase order.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<p>The following are the key disadvantages of using Asynchronous Communication &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In case of a failure, the sender needs to send a message again.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>receiving system</b> should be configured to check duplicate messages.</p></li>
<li><p>In this scenario, the sender application is blocked till a response is received or a time out error occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>You can’t configure multiple receivers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Asynchronous Communication</h2>
<p>In Asynchronous Communication, you add an intermediate system or a middleware between two systems. When a Sender Application sends a request, it does not wait for the Receiver Application to send the response. If there is a failure due to some reason, the middleware is responsible for resending the message. If required, the receiving system can send a response back to Sender as a separate asynchronous call.</p>
<p>This approach in SAP PI is called <b>Exactly Once (EO)</b> or <b>Exactly Once in Order (EOIO)</b>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/asynchronous_communication.jpg" alt="Asynchronous Communication" />
<p>An intermediate system is a queue and message from A is first added to the queue and at receiver end, it is pulled from queue and send to receiver. The response message from system B follows the</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/approach_in_sap_pi.jpg" alt="Approach in SAP PI" />
<p>You can also maintain order in certain situations as per business requirement by using First In First Out (FIFO). This scenario is called Asynchronous with order maintained or Exactly Once in Order (EOIO).</p>
<p>Asynchronous communication assures guaranteed delivery. If the receiver system is not available for sometime, then the intermediate queue keeps the message and it remains there till the receiver system is available and the message is pulled from queue and sent to receiver system.</p>
<h3>Recommended Scenario</h3>
<p>This is recommended for modify operations like creating a purchase order or modify a purchase order</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>The following are the key advantages of asynchronous communication &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In case of failure, the SAP PI system ensures guaranteed delivery and will resend the message.</p></li>
<li><p>No configuration required for duplicate checks.</p></li>
<li><p>You can configure multiple receivers in this scenario.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the sender system and the receiver system need not be online at same time.</p></li>
<li><p>PI logs all the messages sent via asynchronous communication.</p></li>
<li><p>No time out as intermediate system keeps the message and response request.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<p>The following are the key disadvantages of asynchronous communication &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In this scenario, the sender needs to correlate responses to request on its own.</p></li>
<li><p>Response message needs to be implemented and routed separately.</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn’t provide an immediate response.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP PI — Technologies</h2>
<p>SAP provides a middleware based on NetWeaver called the SAP NetWeaver Process Integration. SAP NetWeaver PI delivers a message in specific format called the Simple <b>Object Access Protocol (SOAP-HTTP)</b>. This message contains a header and payload. The header contains general information such as the sender and receiver information and the payload contains the actual data.</p>
<p>System can communicate with SAP NetWeaver PI directly or with the use of adapters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Communication using Application Adapters</li>
<li>Communication using Technical Adapters</li>
<li>Communication using Industry Standard Adapters</li>
<li>Communication using Transaction Adapters</li>
<li>Direct communication using Proxies</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP PI - Securing Objects</h1>
<p>For transferring information in the form of objects from one Enterprise Service Repository to other, you can select from the three means of transport &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>File System Based Transport</li>
<li>Change Management Service (CMS)</li>
<li>Change and Transport System (CTS)</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/esr.jpg" alt="Enterprise Service Repository" />
<p>The illustration shows two software components — Version A and Version B that have been transferred from ESRep_1 and ESRep_2 to other ESRep’s.</p>
<h2>Transport Level Security</h2>
<p>Transport Level Security includes the security of design objects while transferring over the network. While transferring objects you perform authentication and encryption at the transport level and authorization at end point. For internal communication you use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for encryption and decryption of data across a secure connection. For external communication between SAP and non-SAP system, the type of encryption depends on the type of adapter used for communication.</p>

<h2>Transport Level Authorization</h2>
<p>To achieve transport level authorization, you can use HTTP with client authentication. HTTP transport level authentication can use user name and password, X.509 certificates or SAP logon tickets.</p>
<h2>Message Level Security</h2>
<p>Message level security can be achieved using encryption techniques and digital signatures. Message to be sent over network is first encrypted by an encryption algorithm that includes a session key and a public key for encryption. Same session key and public key is used at the receiver’s side for decryption of message to see the content.</p>
<h2>HTTP Transport Level</h2>
<p>You can use the following mechanisms for HTTP Transport Level &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>User Id and Password</li>
<li>X.509 certificates</li>
<li>SAP Logon tickets</li>
<li>Message Level Security</li>
<li>S/MIME</li>
<li>WS Security</li>
<li>XML Signature</li>
<li>XML Encryption</li>

<h1>SAP PI - Creating Objects</h1>
<p>SAP PI is runtime environment that assigns inbound messages to receivers and maps them to another structure or protocol. SAP NW PI requires information about how the messages are to be processed. The information about the design objects are there in PI Enterprise Service Repository ESR and Integration Directory.</p>
<p>Systems that are connected to SAP PI are maintained in the System Landscape Directory (SLD). The data in SLD can be divided into the following categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Software Component Information</li>
<li>System Landscape Description</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software Component Information</h2>
<p>It includes information about all available SAP software modules. It also includes possible combinations of software modules along with dependencies. For example, software component, release, support packages, OS versions and database etc.</p>
<p>To check this, go to System Landscape Directory (SLD)</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/system_landscape.jpg" alt="System Landscape" />
<p>To see all technical systems, their type, versions and last update, go to the Technical System tab.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/technical_system_tab.jpg" alt="Technical System Tab" />
<p>To view products and software components, go to the Software Catalog option.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/software_catalog.jpg" alt="Software Catalog" />
<p>Once you click the Product tab, you can see all the products, and also their version and vendor name.</p>

<h1>SAP PI - Modeling Scenarios</h1>
<p>A Model shows the exchange of messages between applications and its Design Objects like message types, data types, etc. Model is the basis of an integration configuration scenario and the input and output processing defines the routing of messages. SAP PI modeling scenarios are used to design an integration scenario in SAP PI.</p>
<p>You can use the following two integration scenario models &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Process Component Architecture Model</li>
<li>Process Integration Scenario Model</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process Component Architecture Model</h2>
<p>The Process Component Architecture Model is used for application role SOA backbone. This model includes process component model, integration scenario model and process component interaction model. The process component model provides the detail of internal structure of a process component. The integration scenario model defines the complete scenario across different deployment units and process component. Process component model defines how different components interact with each other.</p>
<h2>Process Integration Scenario Model</h2>
<p>This is used for application role process integration scenarios. It is the design object of Enterprise Service Builder and is uniquely identified by a name and namespace and you can create multiple versions.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/scenarios_model.jpg" alt="Scenario Model" />
<p>You need to define a business scenario and business process before you create a process integration model. Process integration steps are performed in applications. An application runs in the form of software component. You can also create multiple versions of software components and the relationship between application and software component is 1:1.</p>
<h1>SAP PI - Design Objects</h1>
<p>A Design Object is uniquely identified by the name and namespace and is assigned to one software component. You can create different design objects to perform various functions and few are mandate objects and others are optional in an integration scenario. Most common design objects include process integration scenario, message types, data types, mappings, etc.</p>
<p>The following table defines common design objects, their functions and use in a scenario &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">

<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Name the field that determines the name of the business system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/name_business_system.jpg" alt="Name Business System" />
<h1>SAP PI - Integration Scenarios</h1>
<p>To create an integration scenario in SAP PI, you need to create technical and business system in System Landscape Directory.</p>
<p>The SLD is implemented as a Java software component (SAP _JTECHT) on the SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java. It is based on the open Common Information Model (CIM) standard, and is defined and published by the Distributed Management Task Force, Inc. at <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >www.dmtf.org</a>.</p>
<p>The SLD is the central listing tool for application component information, products and software components, and system landscape data (technical and business systems).</p>
<p>In SLD, to move from business model to technical model you use relationship between process step and software component.</p>
<h2>How to Transfer Software Components in SLD?</h2>
<p>When you install the System Landscape Directory, the initial catalog is installed.</p>
<p>From SAP Market Place, you can import more up to date catalog.</p>
<p>You can also import your own software components and products depending on the project and integration scenario.</p>
<p>For A2A scenarios, business systems are used and they exist in SLD. For B2B scenario, you use business objects and they reside in Integration Directory.</p>
<h3>Technical System</h3>
<p>Technical systems are part of the System Landscape Directory (SLD) and contain information about version, database and patch levels, operating system, etc.</p>
<p>There are different modes on the technical system &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>AS ABAP System</li>
<li>AS Java System</li>
<li>Standalone Java system</li>
<li>Third Party</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different import tools that can be used to transfer data from the technical system to SLD. SAP NetWeaver Administrator is common SAP AS JAVA &gt; 7.1 import tool.</p>
<h3>Business System</h3>
<p>Business system acts as a sender and a receiver in SLD. They inherit the software components from technical systems as products. No new software components can be added to the business systems in SLD.</p>
<p>With SAP AS ABAP, each client is defined as one business system. In SAP AS Java, each technical system acts as a business system.</p>

<h1>SAP PI - Connectivity</h1>
<p>SAP PI connectivity deals with the connectivity of source or target system with the integration server. This connectivity deals with the exchange of messages with integration server. The message format to be exchanged should be in SAP PI protocol format or an adapter should be used to convert an external format to SAP PI specific format.</p>
<p>SAP PI provides you with a wide range of adapters that allows you to connect applications from different protocols. In the case of the sender, the adapter converts the inbound message encrypted in the sender protocol into a PI-SOAP message; in the case of the receiver, the PI-SOAP message is converted then into the receiver's protocol.</p>
<h2>Available Adapters in SAP NetWeaver PI</h2>

<h1>SAP PI - ccBPM Overview</h1>
<p>Business Process Management deals with <b>cross component BPM</b>. This includes SAP workflow in SAP backend and processing of message on Integration Server.</p>
<p>Cross Component Business Process Management provides SAP NetWeaver Process Integration with functions for stateful message processing, that is, the status of an integration process is persisted on the Integration Server. This means that an integration process can, for example, wait infinitely until further messages are received or until a particular deadline is reached. Moreover, it is possible to process messages further within an integration process.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_pi/images/ccbpm_overview.jpg" alt="ccBPM Overview" />
<p>The above illustration shows that message from system 1, 2, 3 has been sent to the Integration Server and only when all the messages arrived, the composite message has been sent to the target system business system 4. Using cross component BPM, the message that is already on the Integration Server, is made persistent. Any other message that comes to the Integration Server, a relationship is defined between messages to ensure that all messages are sent correctly. Business Process Engine is responsible to perform this task in ccBPM.</p>
<h1>SAP PI - ccBPM Configuration</h1>
<p>While using ccBPM, the integration process used in ccBPM receives inbound message but also sends messages to the corresponding receiver business system.</p>
<p>ccBPM consists of a Graphical Process Editor and a Business Process Engine. Business Process Editor opens when you select an integration process.</p>
<p>To open Business Process Editor, go to ESR &rarr; ES Builder &rarr; Design Objects Integration directory on SAP PI tools page.</p>

<h2>Where SAP PI is Not Recommended?</h2>
<p>SAP PI is not recommended for a synchronous request/response scenario. In synchronous communication, it is invoked by request and response operation and process output is returned immediately after the operation. The load is more on infrastructure in case of synchronous communication.</p>
<p>In a non-SAP backend like Java, DOT NET, SAP PI is not recommended as middleware tool in UI driven scenario.</p>
<p>When a backend system is exposed as UI service, SAP PI is not recommended for UI driven scenarios.</p>
