<h1>SAP Testing - Overview</h1>
<p>Many organizations implement SAP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) to manage their business operations and adapt according to new market challenges. SAP R/3 is an integrated ERP software that allows organizations to manage their business efficiently. Organizations can reduce the cost to run their operations by using SAP R/3 ERP packages.</p>
<p>SAP R/3 also allows customers to interact with different databases to run different applications with the help of a user-friendly GUI. The SAP R/3 system is divided into different modules to cover the functionality of different business operations in an organization.</p>
<p>The most common SAP R/3 modules are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAP Material Management.</li>
<li>SAP Financial Accounting and Controlling.</li>
<li>SAP Sales and Distribution.</li>
<li>SAP Human Resource.</li>
<li>SAP Supply Chain Management.</li>
<li>SAP Plant Management.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SAP Testing</b> is about testing the functionality of these modules and to ensure that they perform as per the configuration.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_testing/images/sap_testing.jpg" alt= "SAP Testing" />
<p>A SAP system undergoes various changes like patch management and fixes, new module implementations, and various other configuration changes. All these modifications raise a need for Regression testing that is to be performed in SAP environments. SAP testing automation tools like SAP Test Acceleration and Optimization tools can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p><b>SAP TAO</b> is an automation tool to generate test cases for end-to-end scenarios for SAP applications. Apart from this, there are various other Automation testing tools for SAP testing like HP QTP, and ECATT, etc. that can be used.</p>
<h2>Importance of Testing</h2>
<p>Here is a list of key reasons why SAP testing is performed and why it is an important function in the growth of an organization &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>System Validation</b> &minus; SAP Testing involves complete end-to-end testing and validation of all SAP modules in SAP ERP environment.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Quality and Revenue</b> &minus; SAP Testing is an output-based testing and not like conventional testing methods which are input-based. It ensures the quality of SAP system and also focuses on revenue and cost of the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cost and Predictability</b> &minus; SAP Testing involves reducing the SAP development costs and improve predictability.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Compliance Requirement</b> &minus; SAP Testing ensures that the SAP implementation is meeting the new compliance requirements in a specific organization and all the modules are working as per the expected configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><b>New Implementation and Configuration Changes</b> &minus; There are different types of changes implemented in a SAP system, like patches and fixes, new implementation, configurational changes. Therefore, SAP testing ensures that all the modules are performing as per requirement in this dynamic system environment.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integration</b> &minus; SAP testing is performed to test various reports, data flows and work flows, GUI forms, etc. It is used to check system integration between different modules. For example, if an order posting is done that requires an action in Sales and Distribution, MM and FICO, then SAP testing checks the integration between these systems.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Performance</b> &minus; It is also used to ensure if the system will be able to meet the Service Level agreements, time taken by system to perform specific actions, performance of the system, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - Types</h1>
<p>There are different testing methods that can be used to test the functionality of a software, system, or an application.</p>
<p>The most common testing techniques are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Unit Testing</b> &minus; It is a type of white-box testing that involves testing a single unit or group of units.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Integration Testing</b> &minus; In this testing, multiple systems are combined together to test the output of the integrated system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Functional Testing</b> &minus; It checks the functionality of each module as per the desired result.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Usability Testing</b> &minus; It checks the ease of use of an application or a system. It checks how easy it would be for a new user to use an application or to understand the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Acceptance Testing</b> &minus; Acceptance testing is performed to test if a system meets the user requirement and whether to accept the application or system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>System Testing</b> &minus; Entire system is tested as per the requirement and specification.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Stress Testing</b> &minus; In this testing, the system is put into stress beyond its specification to check when it fails.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Performance Testing</b> &minus; This testing is performed to check if the system meets the performance requirement.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Regression Testing</b> &minus; It includes testing the full application or system for the modifications.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Beta Testing</b> &minus; The aim of beta testing is to cover unexpected errors. It falls under the class of black-box testing. It is performed by releasing the pre-version of the final product, called Beta.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Database Testing</b> &minus; Database testing is used to test the data in the database. It is performed using SQL statements.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ETL Testing</b> &minus; ETL testing is performed to ensure if data is correctly extracted, transformed, and loaded from a source system to a target system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - Manual &amp; Automation</h1>
<h2>Manual Testing</h2>
<p>Manual testing means you are testing a software manually without using any automated tools or any script. In this type of testing, the tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify bugs or any unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>There are different stages of a manual testing. They are &minus; unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.</p>
<p>Various test plans, test cases, or test scenarios are used by a manual tester to ensure the completeness of testing. Manual testing can also be called <b>exploratory testing</b> because the testers explore the software to identify errors in it manually.</p>
<h2>Automation Testing</h2>
<p>In Automation testing, the tester writes the scripts and uses software tools to test the product. This process involves the automation of a manual process. Automation testing includes re-running the test-cases multiple times that were performed manually.</p>
<p>Automation testing is also used to test the application from load, performance, and stress purpose. It is used to increase the coverage of test. Automation testing improves the accuracy and saves time and money in comparison to manual testing.</p>
<h2>Software Testing Tools</h2>
<p>The following tools can be used for Automation testing &minus; </p>
<ul class="list">
<li>HP Quick Test Professional (QTP)</li>
<li>Selenium</li>
<li>SAP TAO</li>
<li>ECATT</li>
<li>IBM Rational Functional Tester</li>
<li>SilkTest</li>
<li>TestComplete</li>
<li>Testing Anywhere</li>
<li>WinRunner</li>
<li>LaodRunner</li>
<li>Visual Studio Test Professional</li>
<li>WATIR</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - SDLC</h1>
<p>Software Development Life Cycle determines the series of steps to be performed to develop an application or the efficiency of a software. In this chapter, we will discuss the phases defined in SDLC. Each phase has its own process and deliverables that goes into the next phase.</p>
<h2>Feasibility Study</h2>
<p>The first stage of SDLC is <b>requirement gathering</b>. After the requirements are gathered, the team comes up with a rough plan of software process. At this step, the team analyzes if a software can be made to fulfill all the requirements of the user. It is found out if the project is financially, practically, and technologically feasible for the organization to take up. There are many algorithms available, which help the developers to conclude the feasibility of a software project.</p>
<h2>System Analysis</h2>
<p>At this step, the developers decide a roadmap of their plan and try to bring up the best software model suitable for the project. System analysis includes understanding of software product limitations, learning system-related problems or changes to be done in the existing systems, identifying and addressing the impact of the project on the organization and personnel etc. The project team analyzes the scope of the project and plans the schedule and resources accordingly.</p>
<h2>Software Design</h2>
<p>The next step is to bring the whole knowledge of requirements and analysis on to the desk and design the software product. The inputs from the users and the information gathered in the requirement gathering phase are the inputs of this step. The output of this step comes in the form of two designs; <b>logical design</b> and <b>physical design</b>. Engineers produce meta-data and data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow diagrams and in some cases pseudocodes.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>This step is also known as <b>programming phase</b>. The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing the program code in a suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>An estimate says that 50% of the whole software development process should be tested. Errors may ruin the software from critical level to its own removal. Software testing is done while coding by the developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing and testing the product at user’s end. Early discovery of errors and their remedy is the key to developing a reliable software.</p>
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>Software may need to be integrated with the libraries, databases, and other program(s). This stage of SDLC deals with the integration of the software with outer world entities.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Implementation or deployment means installing the software on user machines. At times, the software needs post-installation configurations at the user’s end. Software is tested for portability and adaptability and integration related issues are solved during implementation.</p>
<h2>Software Testing Life Cycle</h2>
<p>Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) consists of all the steps that are performed in a specific way to ensure that quality goals are met and each step has specific goals and deliverables.</p>
<p>STLC is used to improve the quality of a software product and to make it capable to meet the business requirements to achieve certain goals.</p>
<p>The different stages that come under Software Testing Life Cycle are as follows &minus; </p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Requirements phase</li>
<li>Test Planning</li>
<li>Test Analysis</li>
<li>Test Design Phase</li>
<li>Test Implementation</li>
<li>Test Execution Phase</li>
<li>Test Closure Phase</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_testing/images/stlc.jpg"alt="STLC"/>
<h3>Requirement Phase</h3>
<p>This is the first phase of Software Testing Life Cycle. During this phase, the tester’s job is to analyze the requirements. There are various methods for Requirement Analysis like conducting brainstorming sessions with business people, team members, and try to find out whether the requirements are testable or not.</p>
<p>This phase determines the scope of the testing. If a testing team finds any features that can’t be tested, then that should be communicated to the client.</p>
<h3>Test Planning</h3>
<p>In this phase, the tester identifies the activities and resources which would help to meet the testing objectives.</p>
<p>Various metrics are defined and there are methods available to determine and track those metrics. Test planning also includes identifying key performance indicators for testing evaluation.</p>
<h3>Test Analysis</h3>
<p>This phase determines the guidelines that has to be tested. It includes identifying the test conditions using the requirements document, any risks involved, and other test criteria.</p>
<p>Various factors are used to find out the test conditions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Product Complexity</li>
<li>Depth of Testing</li>
<li>Risk Involved</li>
<li>Skills Required</li>
<li>Knowledge of testing team members</li>
<li>Test management</li>
<li>Availability of the stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>Test conditions should be written in a detailed way.</p>
<p>Let us take an <b>example</b>. For a website selling products online, a test condition is that a customer should be able to make an online payment. You can add detailed conditions like, payment should be feasible using Credit card, NEFT transfer, debit card or net banking.</p>
<p>The advantage of writing the detailed test condition is that it increases the scope of testing because test-cases are normally written on the basis of the test condition. It allows to write more detailed test cases. It also helps in determining the condition of when to stop the testing of a software product.</p>
<h3>Test Design Phase</h3>
<p>This phase determines how the tests are performed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Break down the test conditions into multiple sub-conditions to increase its coverage.</li>
<li>Get the test data.</li>
<li>Set up the test environment.</li>
<li>Get the requirement traceability metrics.</li>
<li>Create the test coverage metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test Implementation Phase</h3>
<p>This phase includes the creation of detailed test-cases as per the test conditions and metrics defined.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Prioritize the test case.</li>
<li>Test-case to be used for Regression.</li>
<li>Ensure the correctness of the test-cases.</li>
<li>Sign off of the test-cases before the actual execution starts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test Execution Phase</h3>
<p>This phase of Software Testing Life Cycle involves actual execution of test-cases.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Execute the test-cases.</li>
<li>Log the defects.</li>
<li>Check traceability metrics to track progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test Closure</h3>
<p>This phase includes checking for the completion of the test.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Check if all the test-cases are executed and opened defects.</li>
<li>Note down the lessons learnt.</li>
<li>Close the Testing phase.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Testing Types In SAP</h1>
<p>There are different types of testing methods available that can be used to perform SAP testing.</p>
<h2>Unit Testing</h2>
<p>Unit testing is used to test the functionality of a SAP system and its various components. It is performed by domain and configuration experts who know the functionality of each unit in a system.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose the task is to create a sales order and save it. To perform unit testing for this task, the tester should know that the sales order can be saved using the SAP organization elements like customer master data, partner functions, material master data, company code, credit control area, sales organization, etc.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In ABAP development, Unit testing can be performed to check if a report can be created from developer-generated data. It requires assistance from the domain expert.</p>
<h2>System Testing</h2>
<p>System Testing involves the integration of elements of a SAP system to ensure that related SAP functionality are linked together in the development environment.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>If you say a cash flow for a quotation in an organization would show that a quote can be used to create a sales order, a delivery can be created and processed from the order, the delivery can be billed, the billing released to accounting, and a customer payment applied against the accounting invoice.</p>
<p>Each unit is tested like this and then the test results are combined using system testing.</p>
<h2>Scenario-based Testing</h2>
<p>Scenario testing, as the name suggests, is performed as per specific business cases.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose there are a few tasks that are specific to a customer segment or a given product line or a set of services. For these specific line of target, you have different scenarios that you need to test. This testing is also performed in the development environment.</p>
<h2>Integration Testing</h2>
<p>In this testing, testing data comes from a real data extraction source. Data is known to business end-users.</p>
<p>Integration testing is used to present that the business process, as designed and configured in SAP, runs using real-world data. In addition the testing shows that the interface triggers, reports, workflows are working.</p>
<h2>SAP Interface Testing</h2>
<p>Interface testing ensures that a business process on a SAP system runs automatically, the events are triggered, and the results are transferred to the receiver system. Interface testing involves execution on the sending system followed by automatic generation of the interface output, and then the receiving system consuming that file and proving that a business process continues on the receiver.</p>
<p>Ideally, interface testing involves larger testing activities as a project progresses. Interface testing shows that triggering works, the data selection is accurate and complete, data transfer is successful, and the receiver is able to consume the sent data.</p>
<h2>SAP User Acceptance Testing</h2>
<p>SAP UAT is used to ensure that the end-users are able to perform the assigned job functions with the new system. The important aspect of this testing is to understand the business requirement and to ensure that the expected features, functions and capabilities are available.</p>
<h2>SAP System Performance Testing</h2>
<p>Performance testing checks the following aspects &minus; </p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Whether the system response time is acceptable as per the business requirement</li>
<li>Whether periodic processes are running within permissible time,</li>
<li>Whether the expected concurrent user load can be supported</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance testing identifies bottlenecks and coding inefficiencies in the SAP system. It is not likely that system performance tuning is perfectly set up and the program is running with optimized code.</p>
<h2>SAP Load Testing</h2>
<p>In Load Testing, the tester applies maximum load on a system, either online users or periodic batch processing, and identifies whether the system is capable enough to handle the load. If not, it finds out the steps needed to improve performance.</p>
<h2>SAP Security and Authorizations Testing</h2>
<p>Security and Authorizations Testing is used to ensure that users are only able to execute transactions and access appropriate data that is relevant to their project.</p>
<p>As with the implementation of Security standards, this is really important to test if security and authorization is placed in a system. Test IDs for job roles are created and used to both confirm what a user can do and what a user cannot do.</p>
<h2>SAP Cutover Testing</h2>
<p>Cutover testing is usually performed once in a project lifecycle. Here a full-scale execution is done of all the tasks involved to extract data from legacy systems. Then, to perform any kind of data conversion, load the results into the SAP system and fully validate the results, including a user sign-off.</p>
<h2>SAP Regression Testing</h2>
<p>Regression testing is used to find new functionalities and to test previous functionalities in a system when it is upgraded or a new system is set up. The key role of regression testing is to test the existing functionality and newly updated configuration and codebase.</p>
<p>When you upgrade your SAP system or apply a patch, it shouldn’t affect the functionality that is expected to be performed by the users. In addition, it should not affect the new features that are supposed to be introduced in a new release.</p>
<h1>SAP Testing - Process</h1>
<p>SAP testing process is usually divided into three phases &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Test Planning</li>
<li>Test System setup</li>
<li>Test Execution and evaluation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Planning</h2>
<p>Test planning includes the steps that are involved in the initial phase of testing.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Gathering the requirement. What needs to be tested? Functional requirements to be collected for system and application testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Test-case development for manual and automation testing. In automation testing, various tools can be used for creating test-cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewing the test-cases.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Test System Setup</h2>
<p>Test system setup involves setting up the test environment to run the test-cases. Here, the tester needs to define key metrics for reporting.</p>
<h2>Test Execution and Evaluation</h2>
<p>Test execution and evaluation involves executing the test-cases and noting down the output. It includes the following activities &minus; </p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Defect handling and reporting.</li>
<li>Assessment of Test plans as per result.</li>
<li>Documentation of all defects and compare the results with key metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SAP Testing – Critical Process</h2>
<p>In SAP system testing, you need to identify critical business processes that will be affected by implementing changes in a SAP system. It mostly comes under Regression testing, where you apply a patch or implement a new system.</p>
<p>The first step before applying these changes is to perform <b>change impact analysis</b>. This covers critical processes that will be affected by implementing the change.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us take an example. Suppose the planned changes are as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Planned changes</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>SAP support pack 7</li>
<li>Custom code</li>
<li>SAP enhance package</li>
</ul>
<h3>System effected</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sales Order</li>
<li>Delivery of goods</li>
<li>Payment method</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact Analysis for Critical Processes</h3>
<p>Here, the following activities are to be carried out in Impact Analysis &minus; </p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Identification of the critical business processes impacted by change implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Business justification to be provided as to why this change has to be implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating the test plan to monitor critical processes for SAP testing while performing the change.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation of impact of change on critical processes and the purpose to implement the change.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - Navigation</h1>
<p>SAP testing navigation ensures that you cover each module of your SAP system and perform at least one test for each functionality. It also reduces the manual testing effort and covers most of the testing paths in a SAP system.</p>
<p>OPA tests can be performed to check SAP Testing Navigation. OPA is known as <b>Open Source Programming</b> language and it is mostly used for developing web applications. For compilation of OPA program, you can use Node.js on the server and JavaScript on the client side.</p>
<h2>Creating a Test using OPA</h2>
<p>OPA allows you to use three objects in <b>Qunit.</b> These functions should be defined in a test so that OPA knows what actions to be taken.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Given</b> &minus; to pass arrangements.</p></li>
<li><p><b>When</b> &minus; actions to be taken.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Then</b> &minus; assertion.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how to use all the 3 objects in Qunit &minus; </p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
jQuery.sap.require("sap.ui.test.Opa");
jQuery.sap.require("sap.ui.test.opaQunit");

opaTest("press a Button", function (Given, When, Then) {
   // Arrangements
   Given.iStartMyApp();
	
   //Actions
   When.iPressOnTheButton();
	
   // Assertions
   Then.theButtonShouldHaveADifferentText();
}
</pre>
<p>The next step is to define the three functions.</p>
<h3>Defining the Functions</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var arrangements = new sap.ui.test.Opa ({
   iStartMyApp : function (){
      return this.iStartMyAppInAFrame("../index.html");
   }
}); 
</pre>
<p>In the above function, we have assumed that the app runs in a page called index.html. Our OPA test is located in the test/opa.html folder.</p>
<h3>Defining Arrangements</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var actions = new sap.ui.test.Opa ({

   iPressOnTheButton : function (){
      return this.waitFor ({
         viewName : "Main", id : "pressMeButton", success : function (oButton) {
            oButton.$().trigger("tap");
         },
         errorMessage : "No Button found"
      });
   }
})
</pre>
<h3>Defining Assertions</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var assertions = new sap.ui.test.Opa ({

   theButtonShouldHaveADifferentText : function () {
      return this.waitFor ({
         viewName : "Main",
         id : "pressMeButton",
			
         matchers : new sap.ui.test.matchers.PropertyStrictEquals ({
            name : "text",
            value : "got pressed"
         }),
			
         success : function (oButton) {
            Opa.assert.ok(true, "The button's text changed to: " + oButton.getText());
         },
			
         errorMessage : "No change in Button's text"
      )}
   }
})        
</pre>
<h3>Running the OPA test</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
sap.ui.test.Opa.extendConfig ({
   arrangements : arrangements,
   actions : actions,
   assertions : assertions,
   viewNamespace : "view."
});
</pre>
<h1>SAP Testing - Screen Flow</h1>
<p>Screen flow logic in SAP Testing is like an ABAP code and it is used to contain the processing blocks. It contains the procedural part of the screen. It is created in screen painter and this screen painter is similar to an ABAP editor.</p>
<p>Screen flow logic involves no external data declaration and each processing block is defined with a prefix ‘PROCESS’. For example,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>PROCESS AFTER INPUT</li>
<li>PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT</li>
<li>PROCESS ON HELP-REQUEST</li>
<li>PROCESS ON VALUE-REQUEST</li>
</ul>
<p>Each screen flow logic should contain PROCESS AFTER INPUT and PROCESS BEFORE OUTPUT keywords.</p>
<p>In an event block, you can use keywords like MODULE, FIELD, ON, VALUES, CALL, etc.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Screen Flow Logic Keyword &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>

</table>
<h2>Creating Screen Flow</h2>
<p>In the Repository browser, double-click on the name of a screen and it will display the flow logic of the screen.</p>
<p>The Flow Logic Editor of the Screen Painter will open and you edit the screen flow logic. You can use any of the available ABAP source code editors to define the flow logic.</p>
<p>You can use the following keywords to create the screen flow logic &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">keywords &amp; Description</th>

</table>
<h2>Testing Screens</h2>
<p>Testing screens are used to test the appearance of a screen as it will appear at runtime. If you have already programmed the flow logic, you can choose whether to simulate the screen with or without it.</p>
<p>To perform Screen test, follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Select Screen &rarr; Test.</li>
<li>The system will display a dialog box for the runtime simulation.</li>
<li>You can change the window coordinates, if it is required.</li>
<li>Next, define the scope of simulation.</li>
<li>To include the flow logic, click 'choose complete flow logic'.</li>
<li>Click Continue and the screen simulation will appear.</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - Modules</h1>
<p>There are different SAP modules implemented in an organization that can be tested using various testing tools like HP Quick Test Professional (QTP), IBM Rational Functional Tester (RFT), and SAP Test Acceleration and Optimization (TAO) tool.</p>
<h2>Common SAP Modules</h2>
<p>The common SAP modules are listed below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Financial Modules</b> &minus; Finance Accounting and Controlling (FICO), Treasure (TR), and Enterprise Control (EC).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Logistics Modules</b> &minus; Material Management (MM), Plant Maintenance (PM), Sales and Distribution (SD), Quality Management (QM), etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Human Resource Management</b> &minus; Accounting Payroll, Time Management, Training and Event Management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All these modules are inter-dependent and the functionality of one module affects the functionality of other modules.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose you have to create a Sales Order in Sales and Distribution (SD) module. Here, you first need to enter the <b>transaction code</b>(e.g., Transaction Code VA01). Next, check the stock of the item in Inventory module and check the credit limit available on Customer profile in Customer Relationship Module. It shows that all these modules are interdependent; if you customize any of these modules, it will affect the related ERP system.</p>
<p>To perform SAP testing, you need to understand the features, functionalities, and how the workflow takes place in these SAP modules. Most of the common reasons of failure of ERP implementation project is incorrect test planning and the use of wrong test-cases.</p>
<p>Non SAP ERP systems like PeopleSoft, Edwards, Oracle E business suite have different customers and capabilities. The testing team needs to understand the functionality of complete system.</p>
<h2>Types of Testing Team</h2>
<p>There are normally two types of testers available in SAP projects &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Core Testers</b> &minus; who are responsible to perform basic testing of ERP system and modules.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Implementation Testers</b> &minus; who work on implementation project and cover the customization functionalities of SAP modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Customization requests from clients can impact the modules of a SAP system. The testing team should be able to record each customization request and its impact on the other SAP modules.</p>
<p>ERP systems are large systems and therefore the testing process should ideally be automated. It is always advisable to perform automated testing for ERP systems, as manual testing is a very time-consuming and lengthy process. Without testing each component of the SAP system, it is really tough to achieve 100% quality and successful implementation of SAP project.</p>
<h3>Performing SAP testing for the above example using QTP</h3>
<p>To perform SAP testing for the above example, follow the steps given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The first step is to install HP QTP tool and to install necessary plug-ins within QTP to make it compatible to connect to ERP system.</p></li>
<li><p>The next step is to use HP Quality Center (QC) to develop the test plan and then to convert test plan design to Test Scripts. These test plans can be converted to scripts using HP QTP.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, record the R/3 GUI screen of SAP system for SD module while creating Sales Order or creating PR in MM.</p></li>
<li><p>After you are done with the recording in QTP tool, create a script in VB.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
SAPGuiSession("Session").SAPGuiWindow("SAP Easy Access - User")
   .SAPGuiOKCode("OKCode").Set "/nVA01"

SAPGuiSession("Session").SAPGuiWindow("SAP Easy Access - User"). SendKey ENTER
</pre>
<p>You can also add different parameters and customizations as per your requirement.</p>
<h1>SAP Testing - Interfaces</h1>
<p>An Interface in an ERP system is known as a tool that is responsible to get data from one system and move that data to another system. For example, assume you have a program that produces a report in XML format and then this program reads the XML file to provide input to another system. You can also manipulate while passing the information from one system to other.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider a vendor tool that takes care of employee attendance. Now, the system interface will take this information and populate it in the SAP HR system.</p>
<p>Interface testing ensures that this job is running successfully to ensure that the data is transferred completely and there is no error while transferring the data to the SAP HR system.</p>
<h3>Points to be considered while performing SAP Interface Testing</h3>
<p>SAP Interface testing is purely dependent on the operations and organizational processes. While performing SAP Interface Testing, you need to consider the following key points &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>What is the purpose of using SAP Interface and what business scenarios are processed by the interface?</p></li>
<li><p>Check if the Interface is processing all business scenarios accurately as per the test strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>To perform Interface testing, the best practice is to start with performing Unit testing.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to check if the outbound interface is alright, which means that it ensures to perform file meeting specifications in terms of layout, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to check if the inbound interface is okay. Check if it is reading the file correctly and if it is performing the correct steps in the target system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - Cases</h1>
<p>SAP test-cases are required to perform a check on the installation and configuration of the SAP system, any new implementation, multi-language and device testing, intranet testing, real-time testing, etc.</p>
<p>An ERP system is a common centralized system and is used by multiple users simultaneously in real time. Hence it creates a need to write the test-cases with lot of effort and dedication.</p>
<p>An ERP system also involves various FI transactions, so each test-case should cover the scope of all the configuration and implementation part. Test data should be passed carefully and each test should have a column with name output data.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><b>Test Case ID</b> &minus; XYZ_ERP_SD_A20301</p>
<p><b>Module</b> &minus; SAP Sales &amp; Distribution SD</p>
<p>Let us check the transaction <b>VA01</b> to create a sales order in the Sales and Distribution (SD) system.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_testing/images/transaction_va01.jpg" alt="Transaction VA01" />
<p>Fields to be entered while creating an Order &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Order Date</li>
<li>Order Type</li>
<li>Expiry Date</li>
<li>Customer ID</li>
<li>Shipping Id, Shipping Details, etc</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_testing/images/initial_screen.jpg" alt="Initial Screen" />
<p>Once you enter the details, press Enter and add all the details in the Sales Order.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_testing/images/overview.jpg" alt="Overview" />
<p>To create a SAP test-case, you can pass input data (correct and Incorrect and see the outcome) &minus;</p>
<h3>Correct Input Data</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Order Date 01/01/2016, Order Type Sales Order</li>
<li>Expiry Date 15/01/2016, Shipping Date 10/01/2016,</li>
<li>Select Payment Due Date 10/01/2015, Item Qty 10, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Incorrect Input Data</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Order Date 01/01/2017, Order Type Sales Order</li>
<li>Expiry Date 15/01/2017, Shipping Date 10/01/2017,</li>
<li>Select Payment Due Date 10/01/2017, Item Qty 0, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Data - With Correct Data</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Order is successfully saved in SAP module and invoiced.</li>
<li>Next is Packing slip number.</li>
<li>Next is Shipping Order number, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Data - With incorrect Data</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Error message for incorrect data input. Text message for incorrect input data should be defined in the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Expected Output</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sales Order#</li>
<li>Sales Invoice#</li>
<li>Packing List#, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Testing - TAO</h1>
<p>SAP Testing TAO (Test Acceleration and Optimization) is a tool used to perform automated testing of SAP systems. SAP TAO helps customers to fasten the process of creating automated test cases for SAP systems. Automation testing using TAO is performed by creating test components for various transactions in SAP modules.</p>
<p>Test components using TAO are uploaded to HP Quality Center. Test components created like this are normally for the single transactions and can be later used to create test scenarios. This tool can be easily integrated with SAP Solution Manager to maintain the different test components.</p>
<p>In short, you can say that SAP TAO enables SAP clients in automating the business needs by automatically creating draft test-cases and test components.</p>
<h2>Key Features of TAO</h2>
<p>SAP TAO enables customers to breakdown a single software into multiple parts which can be integrated to test cases using a simple interface by dragging and dropping each part.</p>
<ul class="list">
