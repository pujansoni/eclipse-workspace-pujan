<h1>Front Office Management - Introduction</h1>
<p>Every multi-departmental physical business needs to have a front office or reception to receive the visitors. Front Office Department is the face and as well as the voice of a business.

For a business such as hospitality, the front office department comes with an aspect of elevating customer experience with the business.</p>
<p>Front Office department is a common link between the customers and the business. Let us learn more about it.</p>
<h2>What is Front Office Department?</h2>
<p>It is the one of the many departments of the hotel business which directly interacts with the customers when they first arrive at the hotel. The staff of this department is very visible to the guests.</p>
<p>Front office staff handles the transactions between the hotel and its guests. The staff receives the guests, handles their requests, and strikes the first impression about the hotel into their minds.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/front_office_management/images/front_office_department.jpg" alt="Front Office Department" />

<li>Uniformed services</li>
<li>Concierges</li>
<li>Front Office Accounting System</li>
<li>Private Branch Exchange (PBX), a private telephone network used within an organization</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Responsibilities of Front Office Department</h3>
<p>Following are the most basic responsibilities a front office can handle.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Creating guest database</li>
<li>Handling guest accounts</li>
<li>Coordinating guest service</li>
<li>Trying to sell a service</li>
<li>Ensuring guest satisfaction</li>
<li>Handling in-house communication through PBX</li>
</ul>
<h2>Front Office Operations</h2>
<p>There are two categories of Front Office Operations &minus;</p>
<h3>Front-House Operations</h3>
<p>These operations are visible to the guests of the hotel. The guests can interact and see these operations, hence, the name Front-House operations. Few of these operations include &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Interacting with the guests to handle request for an accommodation.</li>
<li>Checking accommodation availability and assigning it to the guest.</li>
<li>Collecting detail information while guest registration.</li>
<li>Creating a guest’s account with the FO accounting system.</li>
<li>Issuing accommodation keys to the guest.</li>
<li>Settling guest payment at the time of check-out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Back-House Operations</h3>
<p>Front Office staff conducts these operations in the absence of the guests or when the guest’s involvement is not required. These operations involve activities such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Determining the type of guest (fresh/repeat) by checking the database.</li>
<li>Ensuring preferences of the guest to give a personal touch to the service.</li>
<li>Maintaining guest’s account with the accounting system.</li>
<li>Preparing the guest’s bill.</li>
<li>Collecting the balance amount of guest bills.</li>
<li>Generating reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guest Cycle in Hotel</h2>
<p>Generally, a guest’s interaction with the hotel is divided into the following four sequential phases &minus;</p>
<h3>Pre-arrival</h3>
<p>It is the stage when the customer is planning to avail an accommodation in the hotel. In this first stage, the customer or the prospective guest enquires about the availability of the desired type of accommodation and its amenities via telephonic call or an e-mail. The customer also tries to find out more information about the hotel by visiting its website.</p>
<p>At the hotel end, the front office accounting system captures the guest’s information such as name, age, contact numbers, probable duration of stay for room reservation and so on.</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>The front office reception staff receives the guest in the reception. The porters bring in the guest luggage. For the guest with confirmed reservation, the front office clerk hands over a Guest Registration Card (GRC) to the guest and requests the guest to fill in personal information regarding the stay in the hotel. The clerk then registers the guest in the database thereby creating a guest record and a guest account along with it. Later, the clerk hands over a welcome kit and keys of the accommodation. After the procedure of registration, the guest can start occupying the accommodation.</p>
<h3>Occupancy</h3>
<p>During occupancy, a front office accounting system is responsible for tracking guest charges against his/her purchases from the hotel restaurants, room service, bar, or any outgoing telephone calls made via the hotel’s communication systems. The front office staff is responsible to manage and issue the right keys of the accommodations to the right guests. On guests’ request, the staff also makes arrangement for transportation, babysitting, or local touring while the guest is staying in the hotel.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/front_office_management/images/guest_cycle_in_hotel.jpg" alt="Guest Cycle in Hotel" />
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p>During guest departure, the front office accounting system ensures payment for goods and services provided. If a guest’s bill is not completely paid, the balance is transferred from guest to non-guest records. When this occurs, collection becomes the responsibility of the back office accounting division.</p>
<p>At the time of guest departure, the front office staff thanks the guest for giving an opportunity to serve and arrange for handling luggage. In addition, if the guest requires airport or other drop service, the front office bell desk fulfils it.</p>

<h1>Front Office Management - Structure</h1>
<p>Front office area is commonly termed as ‘Reception’, as it is the place where the guests are received when they arrive at the hotel.

<p>The front office structure can be viewed in two ways: the physical setup and the operational structure of the department.</p>
<h2>Physical Setup of Front Office</h2>

<p>Any formal communication outside the hotel is mostly carried out using e-mails and phone calls. For sending coupons or other promotional material, renewing agreements with travel agents or airlines, the front office staff may opt for postal mail.</p>
<h2>Operational Structure of Front Office</h2>

<h1>Front Office Management - Reservation</h1>
<p>Reservation of the hotel accommodation is one of the important responsibilities of the front office department. A potential guest contacts a hotel for availability of the desired type of accommodation and any allied services that the hotel offers. The front office department needs to react to the enquiry of the guests.</p>
<p>For a guest, reservation increases the chances of a better deal for assured accommodation on arrival. For a hotel, reservation can enable a better management of guest experience during usual as well as peak seasons. Reservation procedure varies depending on the size and brand of the hotel and the reservation system employed.</p>
<p>Let us know the details how the front office handles reservations.</p>
<h2>Types of Hotel Reservation Systems</h2>
<p>An efficient and effective reservation system is what adds to the hotel’s profitability. Following are the most popular reservation systems &minus;</p>
<h3>Whitney System of Reservation</h3>
<p>It was developed in 1940 by Whitney Paper Corporation from New York, hence the name. This is a conventional manual reservation system the hotels used to follow during pre-computer days in the hotels. It contains the following setup for reservation &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Slip for request of accommodation reservation</li>
<li>Whitney slip that records guest name, accommodation type, number, and duration of stay</li>
<li>Temporary/Permanent arrival slip</li>
<li>Guest bill</li>
<li>Guest registration card</li>
<li>Correspondence file</li>
<li>Bedroom journal that records daily occupancy of the guest with date, guest name, room type, and room number</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us see how a Whitney slip and the bedroom journal looks like.</p>

<p>Though this system proved efficient, it generated a lot of paperwork with occasional scope for errors. The drawbacks were overcome by the central reservation system.</p>
<h3>Central Reservation System (CRS)</h3>
<p>It is a computerized reservation system that reduces paperwork and can handle large amount of reservation data effortlessly.</p>
<p>In this system, since the guest data and reservation data are stored on the storage disks of the computers, it can be accessed at wish. It is stored in the form of a database of collection of records which can enable searching, adding, removing, or updating any guest related data.</p>
<p>The computerized reservation system not only helps to make guest reservations but also helps to forecast how many accommodations can be reserved in an upcoming time period.</p>
<p>This is how a CRS typically works &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/front_office_management/images/crs.jpg" alt="CRS" />
<p>The guests of hotel sales agents call for checking room availability. It is forwarded to the front office reservation staff. The staff finds out details about the requirement and checks the availability of desired accommodation in the database. According to the reservation policies and procedures, the reservation staff member then notifies or suggests the reception about the accommodation availability and takes further appropriate action.</p>
<h2>The Role of Internet in Reservation</h2>
<p>The Internet has brought a momentum in the hospitality business as well. It facilitates seamless management of a hotel’s offices located at various places and their various departments.</p>
<p>The hotel businesses are actively working on the Internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Internet has simplified complex system of reservations. It enables Online Hotel Management Systems (OHMS) such as <b>Hotelogix</b> to help guests reserve accommodation of their choice fast and conveniently. The guests of the hotel can access rate charts, accommodation availability, check-in and check-out timings, details about the restaurants, and so on, at their own convenience.</p>
<h2>Sources of Reservations</h2>
<p>People travel for various reasons such as personal as well as for MICE. There are various sources from whom the requests of reservation pour in &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Direct Request from Guests</b> &minus; The prospective guests can approach individually to the hotel for reservation of accommodation mostly when they are single travelers or family travelers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Request from Travel Agent</b> &minus; They can approach the hotel for booking accommodations for group travelers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Request from Corporate Agent</b> &minus; An organization can request a hotel to reserve accommodations for their employees, clients, or visitors.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Request from Airlines</b> &minus; The airlines can reserve accommodations for their working staff for routine stay as well as in case of flight cancellations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Request from Institutions</b> &minus; Various SMERF or NGO institutions request to reserve hotels for sports people, delegations of embassies, or performing-art program groups, workshop groups, and alike who travel to different location.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Managing Reservations</h2>
<p>The first step in reserving an accommodation is to check if the requested kind of accommodation is available for selling for a specific period of time. It is done by checking forecast boards or computerized systems.</p>
<h3>Accepting Reservation of Accommodation</h3>
<p>Reservation of an accommodation is accepted if the desired type of accommodation is available in the hotel for selling. If it is not available during a rush season or if the guest is in urgent need, the staff member suggests for almost similar alternative accommodation by stating its amenities and facilities.</p>
<p>Reservation is accepted in the following cases in conjunction with the availability of the accommodation &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Is the guest new to the hotel?</li>
<li>Does the guest have good credentials with the hotel regarding payment and behavior?</li>
<li>Is the guest a VIP?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Denying Reservation of Accommodation</h3>
<p>Denial of reservation directly means loss of revenue. But there are certain situations when the reservation staff turns down the reservation for the guests or agents. The potential causes of denying reservation are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>All accommodations in hotel booked</b> &minus; In such case, the reservation staff refuses the reservation politely and suggests an alternative hotel in the same area or different property of the same owner in a nearby area.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Requested type of accommodation not available</b> &minus; In such case, the reservation staff suggests an alternate accommodation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Guest/Agent blacklisted</b> &minus; Some guests or agents are blacklisted due to their history of payment dues against the hotel. In such case, the reservation clerk seeks for reservation manager’s advice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the reservation section of the front office prepares the list of the reservations for the day and sends it to the front desk. The list also contains vital information such as if the guest is new or repeat, guest preferences about room location or décor. The rooms are then prepared by housekeeping.</p>
<h3>Cancelling a Reservation of Accommodation</h3>
<p>This is yet another event when the hotel loses business with a guest. Though the fact is overt loss of revenue, the front office staff must react to it politely and gracefully. The staff member also needs to convey any cancellation charges the guest must pay while cancelling the reservation. Cancellation is done in the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Finding out details of the guest and respective reserved accommodation.</li>
<li>Verifying charges of cancellation, if any.</li>
<li>Notifying the guest about cancellation charges.</li>
<li>Cancelling the reservation in the system.</li>
<li>Updating the system for accommodation availability.</li>
<li>Confirming the guest about the cancellation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generating Reservation Report</h3>
<p>Reservation reports are generated for the sake of helping the management find trends and making forecast about business.</p>
<p>The reports typically are of the following types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Occupancy report</li>
<li>Special arrival report</li>
<li>Revenue forecast report</li>
<li>Turnaway report</li>
</ul>
<h1>Guest Registration</h1>
<p>Guest registration is nothing but recording the guest’s information for official purposes. At the time of reservation, the front office staff asks the guests to enter their personal information on the GRC.</p>
<p>Registration activity is mandatory for both; the guest with reserved accommodation as well as for the walk-in guest. During registration, the guest is required to enter important information on the GRC such as guest name, contact number, purpose of stay at the hotel, and passport and visa details in case of foreign guest. It is the responsibility of the front office staff not to reveal the guest information to unauthorized persons.</p>
<p>Let us learn more about registration.</p>
<h2>Pre-registration Procedure</h2>
<p>This procedure involves the prospective guests enquiring about the availability of desired type of accommodation. Registration can also be conducted in advance before arrival. It can be done via telephonic conversation in case of frequent guests, VIPs, or group guests.</p>
<p>In case of new walk-in guest, pre-registration is absent as there is no prior interaction between the guest and the hotel. Pre-registration activity accelerates the actual registration process where the desired accommodation is marked as reserved.</p>
<h2>Verifying Guest's Identity</h2>
<p>Since terror attacks on 9/11, the hotels are mandatorily verifying guests’ identities. The staff verifies guest’s identity first by politely asking the guest’s name. The staff member then requests to show a photo ID such as driving license or a valid identity card from a well-known organization where the guest is working. If the guests are from a foreign country, the staff requests them to show passport. The staff member is authorized to ask any verifying questions politely.</p>
<p>The true copies of the passport or ID card are made to verify the guest’s identity and to prepare guest database.</p>
<h2>Registration Card Typical Format</h2>

<h2>Creating Registration Record</h2>
<p>When the guests arrive at the hotel, the front desk staff hands over the GRC to the guest to fill up the information. In case of VIPs, the staff enters the information on the card and receives the guest’s signature.</p>
<p>The staff then creates a registration record of the guest, countersigns, attaches the true copies of the passport or other ID cards, and files this set in the guest history file. The guest reservation record is created as a registration record in the software system.</p>
<h2>Establishing Payment Method</h2>
<p>Guests can pay in advance or at the time of checking-out. Those who have paid in advance are put under Paid-In-Advance (PIA) list. There are various modes of payment out of which a mode that guest prefers is recorded at the time of registration. Following payment methods are available &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cash Payment (which also include money order, travelers’ cheque).</li>
<li>Credit Card/Debit Card Payment (which are accepted only if the cards have not expired).</li>
<li>Cheque Payment (where post-dated cheques are not accepted).</li>
<li>Direct Billing.</li>
<li>Special Payment such as gift card and voucher.</li>
<li>The guests need to select one of the options of payment at the time of registration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assigning an Accommodation</h2>
<p>The front office staff assigns an accommodation to the guest only when the registration is complete. The staff member records the accommodation number into the PMS and describes about its positive attributes briefly.</p>
<p>The reservations staff also informs the bell-boy to take the guest luggage.</p>
<h2>Issuing Room Keys or Access Code</h2>
<p>After the accommodation is assigned, the front office staff gives away the keys or the computerized secret code keys for accessing the accommodation.</p>
<p>It is a general practice to not to speak anything about the room number or the computerized key loudly while giving it to the guest. The bell attendant then assists the guest with luggage handling to the accommodation and explaining the accommodation features. The attendant then gives the keys to the guest, greets for best stay, and leaves the accommodation by closing the door.</p>
<h2>Handling Special Requests</h2>
<p>If the guest is not satisfied with the accommodation for any unsatisfactory or unpleasant reasons, the bell attendant can bring this to the notice of the front desk staff. In addition, if the guest has special requirements such as a cradle for a baby or hot water bag or a shaving kit and alike, the front office staff is obliged to fulfil the request on time.</p>

For example, if a guest has some problem about the hotel policy, the manager calls the guest for interaction over a coffee or a drink and tries to resolve the same. The expenses towards this interaction are then recorded on the management account.</p>
<h2>Folios and Types</h2>
<p>A folio is a statement of all transaction that has taken place in a single account.</p>
<p>The front office staff records all the transactions between the guest and the hotel on the folio. The folio is opened with zero initial balance.

<p><b>By Guest</b> &minus; The guest settles own account by cash/credit card/cheque.</p>
<p><b>By Organization</b> &minus; The organization settles guest account by transferring money to the hotel account.</p>
<h3>Methods of Account Settlement</h3>
<p>There are following popular methods of account settlement &minus;</p>
<p><b>Account Settlement in Local Currency</b> &minus; A guest can pay in terms of a local currency where the payment is not chargeable with conversion fees.</p>
<p><b>Account Settlement in Foreign Currency</b> &minus; If the guest prefers to pay in foreign currency, the service of payment by the bank is chargeable for around 3% to 6% of the total payable amount.</p>

<p><b>Debit Card</b> &minus; Use of magnetic cards for payment against account is most common today. Paying by debit cards is as good as paying by cash as the amount of money is instantly transferred from the guest’s bank account into the hotel’s bank account.</p>
<p>In case of credit card settlement, the accounting staff mails the charge vouchers signed by guests to the credit card company; preferably within a specified time. The credit card company then settles the guest account by transferring money against it.</p>
<p><b>Credit Settlement by Organization</b> &minus; Many national, international, private, or public organizations send their employees or students for attending workshops, seminar, or meetings. Such organizations tie-up with the hotel for paying the bills of their employees on credit. The organizations reserve accommodations depending on the number of room nights (number of rooms × number of nights the representatives are expected to occupy). This is popularly known as account Settlement using Direct Billing.</p>
<p>In <b>direct billing account settlement</b>, the front office staff verifies guest folios and transfers the guest account to non-guest or city account. The hotel’s back-office accounting verifies the guest folios and is responsible to collect the direct billing amount from a direct billing agency such as embassy, university, or organizations.</p>
<p>The accounting section also notifies the guests that if the direct billing agency fails or refuses to pay the charges then the guests need to settle the account by paying them from their pocket.</p>
<p><b>Combined Account Settlement</b> &minus; A guest can settle account by paying partial amount in cash and remaining amount on credit. The front office staff needs to prepare the supporting document for such kind of payment and hands it over to the back-office accounts.</p>
<h1>Front Office Management - Communication</h1>
<p>Healthy communication in the organization fosters mutual trust and sense of cooperation among the staff members and the guests as well as between the staff members and the management body. Front office communication with other departments can make or break the guests’ stay at the hotel.</p>

<h2>Importance of Front Office Communication</h2>
<p>Front office department is responsible for communicating with all other departments in the hotel as well as different sections within the department. To get the front office and back office jobs done successfully, the front office staff members need to communicate with their peers as well as the colleagues and subordinates.</p>
<p>Within the department, the staff of front office communicate with each other to provide the best possible guest services such as reserving accommodations, registering guests, managing guest accounts, handling guest mails, and personalized guest services.</p>
<h3>Interdepartmental Communication</h3>

<h2>Switchboard Operators</h2>
<p>A vital link between the prospective guests and the hotel itself is switchboard operator who represents the hotel. When the customers call the hotel, the call first arrives at the switchboard operator.</p>
<p>Using knowledge of the portfolio, tone of speaking, and the command over language the switchboard operator can handle the influx of the calls. The operator represents the competency of the hotel in the market while speaking with the customers. Generally, the switchboard operator greets the guests and transfers their call to appropriate department.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/front_office_management/images/switchboard_operators.jpg" alt="Switchboard Operators" />
<p>There are two schools of thoughts regarding the area where a switchboard operator should work. Some experts say that they should be visible and some expert advice to assign a separate aloof place for them in the hotel. Today, the task of a switchboard operator for transferring the incoming calls to various departments is computerized and requires less human involvement.</p>
<p>The switchboard operators are informed not to transfer any call to the executive chef or to the banquet manager during busy work hours. Hence, the operator needs to take the message accurately and pass them on to the respective persons on time.</p>
