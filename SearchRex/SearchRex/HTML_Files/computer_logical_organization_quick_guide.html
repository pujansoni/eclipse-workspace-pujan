<h1>Computer Logical Organization - Overview</h1>
<p>In the modern world of electronics, the term <b>Digital</b> is generally associated with a computer because the term <b>Digital</b> is derived from the way computers perform operation, by counting digits. For many years, the application of digital electronics was only in the computer system. But now-a-days, digital electronics is used in many other applications. Following are some of the examples in which <b>Digital electronics</b> is heavily used.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Industrial process control</li>
<li>Military system</li>
<li>Television</li>
<li>Communication system</li>
<li>Medical equipment</li>
<li>Radar</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Signal</h2>
<p><b>Signal</b> can be defined as a physical quantity, which contains some information. It is a function of one or more than one independent variables. Signals are of two types.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Analog Signal</li>
<li>Digital Signal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analog Signal</h2>
<p>An <b>analog signal</b> is defined as the signal having continuous values. Analog signal can have infinite number of different values. In real world scenario, most of the things observed in nature are analog. Examples of the analog signals are following.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Pressure</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Voltage</li>
<li>Current</li>
<li>Power</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graphical representation of Analog Signal (Temperature)</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/analog_signal.jpg" alt="Analog Signal" />
<p>The circuits that process the analog signals are called as analog circuits or system. Examples of the analog system are following.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Amplifiers</li>
<li>Television receiver</li>
<li>Motor speed controller</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantage of Analog Systems</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Less accuracy</li>
<li>Less versatility</li>
<li>More noise effect</li>
<li>More distortion</li>
<li>More effect of weather</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Digital Signal</h2>
<p>A <b>digital signal</b> is defined as the signal which has only a finite number of distinct values. Digital signals are not continuous signals. In the digital electronic calculator, the input is given with the help of switches. This input is converted into electrical signal which have two discrete values or levels. One of these may be called low level and another is called high level. The signal will always be one of the two levels. This type of signal is called digital signal. Examples of the digital signal are following.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Binary Signal</li>
<li>Octal Signal</li>
<li>Hexadecimal Signal</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graphical representation of the Digital Signal (Binary)</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/digital_signal.jpg" alt="Digital Signal" />
<p>The circuits that process the digital signals are called digital systems or digital circuits. Examples of the digital systems are following.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Registers</li>
<li>Flip-flop</li>
<li>Counters</li>
<li>Microprocessors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantage of Digital Systems</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>More accuracy</li>
<li>More versatility</li>
<li>Less distortion</li> 
<li>Easy communicate</li>
<li>Possible storage of information</li>
</ul>

<h1>Digital Number System</h1>
<p>A digital system can understand positional number system only where there are a few symbols called digits and these symbols represent different values depending on the position they occupy in the number.</p>
<p>A value of each digit in a number can be determined using</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The digit</p></li>
<li><p>The position of the digit in the number</p></li>
<li><p>The base of the number system (where base is defined as the total number of digits available in the number system).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Decimal Number System</h2>
<p>The number system that we use in our day-to-day life is the decimal number system. Decimal number system has base 10 as it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. In decimal number system, the successive positions to the left of the decimal point represents units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on.</p>
<p>Each position represents a specific power of the base (10). For example, the decimal number 1234 consists of the digit 4 in the units position, 3 in the tens position, 2 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands position, and its value can be written as</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
(1&times1000) &plus; (2&times100) &plus; (3&times10) &plus; (4&timesl)
(1&times10<sup>3</sup>) &plus; (2&times10<sup>2</sup>) &plus; (3&times10<sup>1</sup>)  &plus; (4&timesl0<sup>0</sup>)
1000 &plus; 200 &plus; 30 &plus; 1
1234
</pre>
<p>As a computer programmer or an IT professional, you should understand the following number systems which are frequently used in computers.</p>

<h2>Decimal to Other Base System</h2>
<p>Steps</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value of the new base.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Get the remainder from Step 1 as the rightmost digit (least significant digit) of new base number.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base.</p></li>

<h1>Binary Codes</h1>
<p>In the coding, when numbers, letters or words are represented by a specific group of symbols, it is said that the number, letter or word is being encoded. The group of symbols is called as a code. The digital data is represented, stored and transmitted as group of binary bits. This group is also called as <b>binary code</b>. The binary code is represented by the number as well as alphanumeric letter.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Binary Code</h2>
<p>Following is the list of advantages that binary code offers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Binary codes are suitable for the computer applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Binary codes are suitable for the digital communications.</p></li>
<li><p>Binary codes make the analysis and designing of digital circuits if we use the binary codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Since only 0 &amp; 1 are being used, implementation becomes easy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification of binary codes</h2>
<p>The codes are broadly categorized into following four categories.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Weighted Codes</li>
<li>Non-Weighted Codes</li>
<li>Binary Coded Decimal Code</li>
<li>Alphanumeric Codes</li>
<li>Error Detecting Codes</li>
<li>Error Correcting Codes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Weighted Codes</h2>
<p>Weighted binary codes are those binary codes which obey the positional weight principle. Each position of the number represents a specific weight. Several systems of the codes are used to express the decimal digits 0 through 9. In these codes each decimal digit is represented by a group of four bits.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/weighted_code.jpg" alt="Weighted Code" />
<h2>Non-Weighted Codes</h2>
<p>In this type of binary codes, the positional weights are not assigned. The examples of non-weighted codes are Excess-3 code and Gray code.</p>
<h3>Excess-3 code</h3>
<p>The Excess-3 code is also called as XS-3 code. It is non-weighted code used to express decimal numbers. The Excess-3 code words are derived from the 8421 BCD code words adding (0011)2 or (3)10 to each code word in 8421. The excess-3 codes are obtained as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/excess3_code.jpg" alt="Excess-3 code" />
<h3>Example</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/bcd_excess3_code.jpg" alt="BCD to Excess-3 code" />
<h3>Gray Code</h3>
<p>It is the non-weighted code and it is not arithmetic codes. That means there are no specific weights assigned to the bit position. It has a very special feature that, only one bit will change each time the decimal number is incremented as shown in fig. As only one bit changes at a time, the gray code is called as a unit distance code. The gray code is a cyclic code. Gray code cannot be used for arithmetic operation.</p> 
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/gray_code.jpg" alt="Gray code" />
<h3>Application of Gray code</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Gray code is popularly used in the shaft position encoders.</p></li>
<li><p>A shaft position encoder produces a code word which represents the angular position of the shaft.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) code</h2>
<p>In this code each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary number. BCD is a way to express each of the decimal digits with a binary code. In the BCD, with four bits we can represent sixteen numbers (0000 to 1111). But in BCD code only first ten of these are used (0000 to 1001). The remaining six code combinations i.e. 1010 to 1111 are invalid in BCD.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/bcd_code.jpg" alt="BCD code" />
<h3>Advantages of BCD Codes</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>It is very similar to decimal system.</li>
<li>We need to remember binary equivalent of decimal numbers 0 to 9 only.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of BCD Codes</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The addition and subtraction of BCD have different rules.</p></li>
<li><p>The BCD arithmetic is little more complicated.</p></li>
<li><p>BCD needs more number of bits than binary to represent the decimal number. So BCD is less efficient than binary.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Alphanumeric codes</h2>
<p>A binary digit or bit can represent only two symbols as it has only two states '0' or '1'. But this is not enough for communication between two computers because there we need many more symbols for communication. These symbols are required to represent 26 alphabets with capital and small letters, numbers from 0 to 9, punctuation marks and other symbols.</p>
<p>The alphanumeric codes are the codes that represent numbers and alphabetic characters. Mostly such codes also represent other characters such as symbol and various instructions necessary for conveying information. An alphanumeric code should at least represent 10 digits and 26 letters of alphabet i.e. total 36 items. The following three alphanumeric codes are very commonly used for the data representation.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).</li>
<li>Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC).</li>
<li>Five bit Baudot Code.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASCII code is a 7-bit code whereas EBCDIC is an 8-bit code. ASCII code is more commonly used worldwide while EBCDIC is used primarily in large IBM computers.</p>
<h2>Error Codes</h2>
<p>There are binary code techniques available to detect and correct data during data transmission.</p>

<h1>Complement Arithmetic</h1>
<p>Complements are used in the digital computers in order to simplify the subtraction operation and for the logical manipulations. For each radix-r system (radix r represents base of number system) there are two types of complements.</p>

<h2>Binary system complements</h2>
<p>As the binary system has base r = 2. So the two types of complements for the binary system are 2's complement and 1's complement.</p>
<h3>1's complement</h3>
<p>The 1's complement of a number is found by changing all 1's to 0's and all 0's to 1's. This is called as taking complement or 1's complement. Example of 1's Complement is as follows.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/1s_complement.jpg" alt="1's complement"/>
<h3>2's complement</h3>
<p>The 2's complement of binary number is obtained by adding 1 to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of 1's complement of the number.</p>
<p>2's complement = 1's complement &plus; 1</p>
<p>Example of 2's Complement is as follows.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/2s_complement.jpg" alt="2's complement"/>
<h1>Binary Arithmetic</h1>
<p>Binary arithmetic is essential part of all the digital computers and many other digital system.</p>
<h2>Binary Addition</h2>
<p>It is a key for binary subtraction, multiplication, division. There are four rules of binary addition.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/addition_table.jpg" alt="Addition Table" />                                 
<p>In fourth case, a binary addition is creating a sum of (1 &plus; 1 = 10) i.e. 0 is written in the given column and a carry of 1 over to the next column.</p>

<h1>Boolean Algebra</h1>
<p>Boolean Algebra is used to analyze and simplify the digital (logic) circuits. It uses only the binary numbers i.e. 0 and 1. It is also called as <b>Binary Algebra</b> or <b>logical Algebra</b>. Boolean algebra was invented by <b>George Boole</b> in 1854.</p>
<h2>Rule in Boolean Algebra</h2>
<p>Following are the important rules used in Boolean algebra.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Variable used can have only two values. Binary 1 for HIGH and Binary 0 for LOW.</p></li>
<li><p>Complement of a variable is represented by an overbar (-). Thus, complement of variable B is represented as <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/b_bar.jpg" alt="B Bar" class="inline"/>. Thus if B = 0 then <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/b_bar.jpg" alt="B Bar" class="inline"/> = 1 and B = 1 then <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/b_bar.jpg" alt="B Bar" class="inline"/> = 0.</p></li>
<li><p>ORing of the variables is represented by a plus (+) sign between them. For example ORing of A, B, C is represented as A &plus; B &plus; C.</p></li>
<li><p>Logical ANDing of the two or more variable is represented by writing a dot between them such as A.B.C. Sometime the dot may be omitted like ABC.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Boolean Laws</h2>
<p>There are six types of Boolean Laws.</p>
<h3>Commutative law</h3>
<p>Any binary operation which satisfies the following expression is referred to as commutative operation.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/commutative.jpg" alt="Commutative Law" />
<p>Commutative law states that changing the sequence of the variables does not have any effect on the output of a logic circuit.</p>
<h3>Associative law</h3>
<p>This law states that the order in which the logic operations are performed is irrelevant as their effect is the same.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/associative.jpg" alt="Associative Law" />
<h3>Distributive law</h3>
<p>Distributive law states the following condition.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/distributive.jpg" alt="Distributive Law" />
<h3>AND law</h3>
<p>These laws use the AND operation. Therefore they are called as <b>AND</b> laws.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/and.jpg" alt="AND Law" />
<h3>OR law</h3>
<p>These laws use the OR operation. Therefore they are called as <b>OR</b> laws.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/or.jpg" alt="OR Law" />
<h3>INVERSION law</h3>
<p>This law uses the NOT operation. The inversion law states that double inversion of a variable results in the original variable itself.</p>

<h1>Combinational Circuits</h1>
<p>Combinational circuit is a circuit in which we combine the different gates in the circuit, for example encoder, decoder, multiplexer and demultiplexer. Some of the characteristics of combinational circuits are following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The output of combinational circuit at any instant of time, depends only on the levels present at input terminals.</p></li>
<li><p>The combinational circuit do not use any memory. The previous state of input does not have any effect on the present state of the circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>A combinational circuit can have an n number of inputs and m number of outputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Block diagram</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/combinational_circuit_blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram of combinational circuit" />
<p>We're going to elaborate few important combinational circuits as follows.</p>
<h2>Half Adder</h2>
<p>Half adder is a combinational logic circuit with two inputs and two outputs. The half adder circuit is designed to add two single bit binary number A and B. It is the basic building block for addition of two <b>single</b> bit numbers. This circuit has two outputs <b>carry</b> and <b>sum</b>.</p>

<h2>Full Adder</h2>
<p>Full adder is developed to overcome the drawback of Half Adder circuit. It can add two one-bit numbers A and B, and carry c. The full adder is a three input and two output combinational circuit.</p>
<h3>Block diagram</h3>

<h3>Circuit Diagram</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fulladder_circuitdiagram.jpg" alt="Full Adder Circuit Diagram" />  
<h2>N-Bit Parallel Adder</h2>
<p>The Full Adder is capable of adding only two single digit binary number along with a carry input. But in practical we need to add binary numbers which are much longer than just one bit. To add two n-bit binary numbers we need to use the n-bit parallel adder. It uses a number of full adders in cascade. The carry output of the previous full adder is connected to carry input of the next full adder.</p>
<h3>4 Bit Parallel Adder</h3>
<p>In the block diagram, A<sub>0</sub> and B<sub>0</sub> represent the LSB of the four bit words A and B. Hence Full Adder-0 is the lowest stage. Hence its C<sub>in</sub> has been permanently made 0. The rest of the connections are exactly same as those of n-bit parallel adder is shown in fig. The four bit parallel adder is a very common logic circuit.</p>
<h3>Block diagram</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fourbitadder_blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram of Four bit Adder" />
<h2>N-Bit Parallel Subtractor</h2>
<p>The subtraction can be carried out by taking the 1's or 2's complement of the number to be subtracted. For example we can perform the subtraction (A-B) by adding either 1's or 2's complement of B to A. That means we can use a binary adder to perform the binary subtraction.</p>
<h3>4 Bit Parallel Subtractor</h3>
<p>The number to be subtracted (B) is first passed through inverters to obtain its 1's complement. The 4-bit adder then adds A and 2's complement of B to produce the subtraction. S<sub>3</sub> S<sub>2</sub> S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>0</sub> represents the result of binary subtraction (A-B) and carry output C<sub>out</sub> represents the polarity of the result. If A &gt; B then Cout = 0 and the result of binary form (A-B) then C<sub>out</sub> = 1 and the result is in the 2's complement form.</p>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fourbitsubstractor_blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram of Four bit Substrator" />
<h2>Half Subtractors</h2>
<p>Half subtractor is a combination circuit with two inputs and two outputs (difference and borrow). It produces the difference between the two binary bits at the input and also produces an output (Borrow) to indicate if a 1 has been borrowed. In the subtraction (A-B), A is called as Minuend bit and B is called as Subtrahend bit.</p>

<h3>Circuit Diagram</h3>

<h2>Full Subtractors</h2>
<p>The disadvantage of a half subtractor is overcome by full subtractor. The full subtractor is a combinational circuit with three inputs A,B,C and two output D and C'. A is the 'minuend', B is 'subtrahend', C is the 'borrow' produced by the previous stage, D is the difference output and C' is the borrow output.</p>

<h2>Multiplexers</h2>
<p>Multiplexer is a special type of combinational circuit. There are n-data inputs, one output and m select inputs with 2m = n. It is a digital circuit which selects one of the n data inputs and routes it to the output. The selection of one of the n inputs is done by the selected inputs. Depending on the digital code applied at the selected inputs, one out of n data sources is selected and transmitted to the single output Y. E is called the strobe or enable input which is useful for the cascading. It is generally an active low terminal that means it will perform the required operation when it is low.</p>
<h3>Block diagram</h3>

<h2>Demultiplexers</h2>
<p>A demultiplexer performs the reverse operation of a multiplexer i.e. it receives one input and distributes it over several outputs. It has only one input, n outputs, m select input. At a time only one output line is selected by the select lines and the input is transmitted to the selected output line. A de-multiplexer is equivalent to a single pole multiple way switch as shown in fig.</p>
<p>Demultiplexers comes in multiple variations.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>1 : 2 demultiplexer</li>
<li>1 : 4 demultiplexer</li>
<li>1 : 16 demultiplexer</li>
<li>1 : 32 demultiplexer</li>

<h2>Decoder</h2>
<p>A decoder is a combinational circuit. It has n input and to a maximum m =  2n outputs. Decoder is identical to a demultiplexer without any data input. It performs operations which are exactly opposite to those of an encoder.</p>
<h3>Block diagram</h3>

<h2>Encoder</h2>
<p>Encoder is a combinational circuit which is designed to perform the inverse operation of the decoder. An encoder has n number of input lines and m number of output lines. An encoder produces an m bit binary code corresponding to the digital input number. The encoder accepts an n input digital word and converts it into an m bit another digital word.</p>
<h3>Block diagram</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/encoder_blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram of encoder" />
<p>Examples of Encoders are following.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Priority encoders</li>
<li>Decimal to BCD encoder</li>
<li>Octal to binary encoder</li>
<li>Hexadecimal to binary encoder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Priority Encoder</h2>
<p>This is a special type of encoder. Priority is given to the input lines. If two or more input line are 1 at the same time, then the input line with highest priority will be considered. There are four input D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and two output Y<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub>. Out of the four input D<sub>3</sub> has the highest priority and D<sub>0</sub> has the lowest priority. That means if D<sub>3</sub> = 1 then Y<sub>1</sub> Y<sub>1</sub> = 11 irrespective of the other inputs. Similarly if D<sub>3</sub> = 0 and D<sub>2</sub> = 1 then Y<sub>1</sub> Y<sub>0</sub> = 10 irrespective of the other inputs.</p>

<h1>Sequential Circuits</h1>
<p>The combinational circuit does not use any memory. Hence the previous state of input does not have any effect on the present state of the circuit. But sequential circuit has memory so output can vary based on input. This type of circuits uses previous input, output, clock and a memory element.</p>
<h2>Block diagram</h2>

<h2>Flip Flop</h2>
<p>Flip flop is a sequential circuit which generally samples its inputs and changes its outputs only at particular instants of time and not continuously. Flip flop is said to be edge sensitive or edge triggered rather than being level triggered like latches.</p>
<h2>S-R Flip Flop</h2>
<p>It is basically S-R latch using NAND gates with an additional <b>enable</b> input. It is also called as level triggered SR-FF. For this, circuit in output will take place if and only if the enable input (E) is made active. In short this circuit will operate as an S-R latch if E = 1 but there is no change in the output if E = 0.</p>

<h2>Master Slave JK Flip Flop</h2>
<p>Master slave JK FF is a cascade of two S-R FF with feedback from the output of second to input of first. Master is a positive level triggered. But due to the presence of the inverter in the clock line, the slave will respond to the negative level. Hence when the clock = 1 (positive level) the master is active and the slave is inactive. Whereas when clock = 0 (low level) the slave is active and master is inactive.</p>

<h2>Delay Flip Flop / D Flip Flop</h2>
<p>Delay Flip Flop or D Flip Flop is the simple gated S-R latch with a NAND inverter connected between S and R inputs. It has only one input. The input data is appearing at the output after some time. Due to this data delay between i/p and o/p, it is called delay flip flop. S and R will be the complements of each other due to NAND inverter. Hence S = R = 0 or S = R = 1, these input condition will never appear. This problem is avoid by SR = 00 and SR = 1 conditions.</p>

<h1>Digital Registers</h1>
<p>Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the digital data. To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, we have to use a group of flip-flop. Such a group of flip-flop is known as a <b>Register</b>. The <b>n-bit register</b> will consist of <b>n</b> number of flip-flop and it is capable of storing an <b>n-bit</b> word.</p>
<p>The binary data in a register can be moved within the register from one flip-flop to another. The registers that allow such data transfers are called as <b>shift registers</b>. There are four mode of operations of a shift register.</p> 
<ul class="list">
<li>Serial Input Serial Output</li>
<li>Serial Input Parallel Output</li>
<li>Parallel Input Serial Output</li>
<li>Parallel Input Parallel Output</li>
</ul>
<h2>Serial Input Serial Output</h2>
<p>Let all the flip-flop be initially in the reset condition i.e. Q<sub>3</sub> = Q<sub>2</sub> = Q<sub>1</sub> = Q<sub>0</sub> = 0. If an entry of a four bit binary number 1 1 1 1 is made into the register, this number should be applied to <b>D<sub>in</sub></b> bit with the LSB bit applied first. The D input of FF-3 i.e. D<sub>3</sub> is connected to serial data input <b>D<sub>in</sub></b>. Output of FF-3 i.e. Q<sub>3</sub> is connected to the input of the next flip-flop i.e. D<sub>2</sub> and so on.</p>
<h3>Block Diagram</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/siso_blockdiagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram of SISO Register" />
<h3>Operation</h3>
<p>Before application of clock signal, let Q<sub>3</sub> Q<sub>2</sub> Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>0</sub> = 0000 and apply LSB bit of the number to be entered to D<sub>in</sub>. So D<sub>in</sub> = D<sub>3</sub> = 1. Apply the clock. On the first falling edge of clock, the FF-3 is set, and stored word in the register is Q<sub>3</sub> Q<sub>2</sub> Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>0</sub> = 1000.</p> 
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/siso_operation1.jpg" alt="SISO Operation step 1" />
<p>Apply the next bit to D<sub>in</sub>. So D<sub>in</sub> = 1. As soon as the next negative edge of the clock hits, FF-2 will set and the stored word change to Q<sub>3</sub> Q<sub>2</sub> Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>0</sub> = 1100.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/siso_operation2.jpg" alt="SISO Operation step 2" />
<p>Apply the next bit to be stored i.e. 1 to D<sub>in</sub>. Apply the clock pulse. As soon as the third negative clock edge hits, FF-1 will be set and output will be modified to Q<sub>3</sub> Q<sub>2</sub> Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>0</sub> = 1110.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/siso_operation3.jpg" alt="SISO Operation step 3" />
<p>Similarly with D<sub>in</sub> = 1 and with the fourth negative clock edge arriving, the stored word in the register is  Q<sub>3</sub> Q<sub>2</sub> Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>0</sub> = 1111.</p>

<h2>Serial Input Parallel Output</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In such types of operations, the data is entered serially and taken out in parallel fashion.</p></li>
<li><p>Data is loaded bit by bit. The outputs are disabled as long as the data is loading.</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as the data loading gets completed, all the flip-flops contain their required data, the outputs are enabled so that all the loaded data is made available over all the output lines at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>4 clock cycles are required to load a four bit word. Hence the speed of operation of SIPO mode is same as that of SISO mode.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Parallel Input Serial Output (PISO)</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Data bits are entered in parallel fashion.</p></li>
<li><p>The circuit shown below is a four bit parallel input serial output register.</p></li>
<li><p>Output of previous Flip Flop is connected to the input of the next one via a combinational circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>The binary input word B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> is applied though the same combinational circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two modes in which this circuit can work namely - shift mode or load mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Load mode</h3>
<p>When the shift/load bar line is low (0), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become active they will pass B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> bits to the corresponding flip-flops. On the low going edge of clock, the binary input B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> will get loaded into the corresponding flip-flops. Thus parallel loading takes place.</p>
<h3>Shift mode</h3>
<p>When the shift/load bar line is low (1), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become inactive. Hence the parallel loading of the data becomes impossible. But the AND gate 1,3 and 5 become active. Therefore the shifting of data from left to right bit by bit on application of clock pulses. Thus the parallel in serial out operation takes place.</p> 
<h3>Block Diagram</h3>

<h2>Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO)</h2>
<p>In this mode, the 4 bit binary input B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub> is applied to the data inputs D<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> respectively of the four flip-flops. As soon as a negative clock edge is applied, the input binary bits will be loaded into the flip-flops simultaneously. The loaded bits will appear simultaneously to the output side. Only clock pulse is essential to load all the bits.</p>

<h2>Bidirectional Shift Register</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If a binary number is shifted left by one position then it is equivalent to multiplying the original number by 2. Similarly if a binary number is shifted right by one position then it is equivalent to dividing the original number by 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Hence if we want to use the shift register to multiply and divide the given binary number, then we should be able to move the data in either left or right direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Such a register is called bi-directional register. A four bit bi-directional shift register is shown in fig.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two serial inputs namely the serial right shift data input DR, and the serial left shift data input DL along with a mode select input (M).</p></li>

<h2>Universal Shift Register</h2>
<p>A shift register which can shift the data in only one direction is called a uni-directional shift register. A shift register which can shift the data in both directions is called a bi-directional shift register. Applying the same logic, a shift register which can shift the data in both directions as well as load it parallely, is known as a universal shift register. The shift register is capable of performing the following operation &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Parallel loading</li>
<li>Lift shifting</li>
<li>Right shifting</li>
</ul>
<p>The mode control input is connected to logic 1 for parallel loading operation whereas it is connected to 0 for serial shifting. With mode control pin connected to ground, the universal shift register acts as a bi-directional register. For serial left operation, the input is applied to the serial input which goes to AND gate-1 shown in figure. Whereas for the shift right operation, the serial input is applied to D input.</p>

<h1>Digital Counters</h1>

<ul class="list">

<h2>Asynchronous or ripple counters</h2>
<p>The logic diagram of a 2-bit ripple up counter is shown in figure. The toggle (T) flip-flop are being used. But we can use the JK flip-flop also with J and K connected permanently to logic 1.

<h2>Classification of counters</h2>
<p>Depending on the way in which the counting progresses, the synchronous or asynchronous counters are classified as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Up counters</li>
<li>Down counters</li>
<li>Up/Down counters</li>
</ul>
<h2>UP/DOWN Counter</h2>
<p>Up counter and down counter is combined together to obtain an UP/DOWN counter. A mode control (M) input is also provided to select either up or down mode. A combinational circuit is required to be designed and used between each pair of flip-flop in order to achieve the up/down operation.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Type of up/down counters</li>
<li>UP/DOWN ripple counters</li>
<li>UP/DOWN synchronous counter</li>
</ul>
<h2>UP/DOWN Ripple Counters</h2>
<p>In the UP/DOWN ripple counter all the FFs operate in the toggle mode. So either T flip-flops or JK flip-flops are to be used. The LSB flip-flop receives clock directly. But the clock to every other FF is obtained from (Q = Q bar) output of the previous FF.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>UP counting mode (M=0)</b> &minus; The Q output of the preceding FF is connected to the clock of the next stage if up counting is to be achieved. For this mode, the mode select input M is at logic 0 (M=0).</p></li>
<li><p><b>DOWN counting mode (M=1)</b> &minus; If M = 1, then the Q bar output of the preceding FF is connected to the next FF. This will operate the counter in the counting mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>3-bit binary up/down ripple counter.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>3-bit &minus; hence three FFs are required.</p></li>
<li><p>UP/DOWN &minus; So a mode control input is essential.</p></li>
<li><p>For a ripple up counter, the Q output of preceding FF is connected to the clock input of the next one.</p></li>
<li><p>For a ripple up counter, the Q output of preceding FF is connected to the clock input of the next one.</p></li>
<li><p>For a ripple down counter, the Q bar output of preceding FF is connected to the clock input of the next one.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the selection of Q and Q bar output of the preceding FF be controlled by the mode control input M such that,	If M = 0, UP counting. So connect Q to CLK. If M = 1, DOWN counting. So connect Q bar to CLK.</p></li>

<td><b>Case 2: With M = 1 (Down counting mode)</b></td>

<p>If M = 1, then AND gates 2 and 4 in fig. are enabled whereas the AND gates 1 and 3 are disabled.</p>
<p>Hence Q<sub>A</sub> bar gets connected to the clock input of FF-B and Q<sub>B</sub> bar gets connected to the clock input of FF-C.</p>
<p>These connections will produce a down counter. Thus with M = 1 the circuit works as a down counter.</p>

<h1>Memory Devices</h1>
<p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instruction. Computer memory is the storage space in computer where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.</p>
<p>The memory is divided into large number of small parts. Each part is called a cell. Each location or cell has a unique address which varies from zero to memory size minus one.</p>
<p>For example if computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory location. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>Memory is primarily of two types</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Internal Memory</b> &minus; cache memory and primary/main memory</p></li>
<li><p><b>External Memory</b> &minus; magnetic disk / optical disk etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/memory_hiearchy.jpg" alt="Memory Hiearchy" />
<p>Characteristics of Memory Hierarchy are following when we go from top to bottom.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Capacity in terms of storage increases.</li>
<li>Cost per bit of storage decreases.</li>
<li>Frequency of access of the memory by the CPU decreases.</li>
<li>Access time by the CPU increases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>RAM</h2>
<p>A RAM constitutes the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program and program result. It is read/write memory. It is called random access memory (RAM).</p>
<p>Since access time in RAM is independent of the address to the word that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other location &amp; takes the same amount of time. We can reach into the memory at random &amp; extremely fast but can also be quite expensive.</p> 
<p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup uninterruptible power system (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</p> 
<p>RAM is of two types</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li>
<li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Static RAM (SRAM)</h3>
<p>The word <b>static</b> indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power remains applied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage, so SRAM need not have to be refreshed on a regular basis.</p> 
<p>Because of the extra space in the matrix, SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space, thus making the manufacturing costs higher.</p> 
<p>Static RAM is used as cache memory needs to be very fast and small.</p>
<h3>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</h3>
<p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually <b>refreshed</b> in order for it to maintain the data. This is done by  placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory because it is cheap and small. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells. These cells are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p>
<h2>ROM</h2> 
<p>ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture.</p>
<p>A ROM, stores such instruction as are required to start computer when electricity is first turned on, this operation is referred to as bootstrap. ROM chip are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave oven.</p>
<p>Following are the various types of ROM &minus;</p>
<h3>MROM (Masked ROM)</h3>
<p>The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. These kind of ROMs are known as masked ROMs. It is inexpensive ROM.</p>
<h3>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</h3>
<p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM programmer. Inside the PROM chip there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p>
<h3>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h3>
<p>The EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of upto 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region. The charge is retained for more than ten years because the charge has no leakage path. For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid). This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge. During normal use the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker.</p>
<h3>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</h3>
<p>The EEPROM is programmed and erased electrically. It can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times. Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond). In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed. EEPROMs can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip. Hence, the process of re-programming is flexible but slow.</p>
<h2>Serial Access Memory</h2>
<p>Sequential access means the system must search the storage device from the beginning of the memory address until it finds the required piece of data. Memory device which supports such access is called a Sequential Access Memory or Serial Access Memory. Magnetic tape is an example of serial access memory.</p>
<h2>Direct Access Memory</h2>
<p>Direct access memory or Random Access Memory, refers to conditions in which a system can go directly to the information that the user wants. Memory device which supports such access is called a Direct Access Memory. Magnetic disks, optical disks are examples of direct access memory.</p>
<h2>Cache Memory</h2>
<p>Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by CPU. The parts of data and programs, are transferred from disk to cache memory by operating system, from where CPU can access them.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache memory is faster than main memory.</li>
<li>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</li>
<li>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.</li>
<li>It stores data for temporary use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Cache memory has limited capacity.</li>
<li>It is very expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes which are not completely available in memory. The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory. Virtual memory is the separation of user logical memory from physical memory.</p>
<p>This separation allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller physical memory is available. Following are the situations, when entire program is not required to be loaded fully in main memory.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>User written error handling routines are used only when an error occurred in the data or computation.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain options and features of a program may be used rarely.</p></li>
<li><p>Many tables are assigned a fixed amount of address space even though only a small amount of the table is actually used.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to execute a program that is only partially in memory would counter many benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>Less number of I/O would be needed to load or swap each user program into memory.</p></li>
<li><p>A program would no longer be constrained by the amount of physical memory that is available.</p></li>
<li><p>Each user program could take less physical memory, more programs could be run the same time, with a corresponding increase in CPU utilization and throughput.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Auxiliary Memory</h2>
<p>Auxiliary memory is much larger in size than main memory but is slower. It normally stores system programs, instruction and data files. It is also known as secondary memory. It can also be used as an overflow/virtual memory in case the main memory capacity has been exceeded. Secondary memories cannot be accessed directly by a processor. First the data/information of auxiliary memory is transferred to the main memory and then that information can be accessed by the CPU. Characteristics of Auxiliary Memory are following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Non-volatile memory</b> &minus; Data is not lost when power is cut off.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reusable</b> &minus; The data stays in the secondary storage on permanent basis until it is not overwritten or deleted by the user.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reliable</b> &minus; Data in secondary storage is safe because of high physical stability of secondary storage device.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Convenience</b> &minus; With the help of a computer software, authorised people can locate and access the data quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Capacity</b> &minus; Secondary storage can store large volumes of data in sets of multiple disks.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cost</b> &minus; It is much lesser expensive to store data on a tape or disk than primary memory.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>CPU Architecture</h1>

<h2>Flags</h2>  
<p>Flags are programmable. They can be used to store and transfer the data from the registers by using instruction. The ALU includes five flip-flops that are set and reset according to data condition in accumulator and other registers.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>S (Sign) flag</b> &minus; After the execution of an arithmetic operation, if bit D<sub>7</sub> of the result is 1, the sign flag is set. It is used to signed number. In a given byte, if D<sub>7</sub> is 1 means negative number. If it is zero means it is a positive number.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Z (Zero) flag</b> &minus; The zero flag is set if ALU operation result is 0.</p></li>
<li><p><b>AC (Auxiliary Carry) flag</b> &minus; In arithmetic operation, when carry is generated by digit D3 and passed on to digit D<sub>4</sub>, the AC flag is set. This flag is used only internally BCD operation.</p></li>

<li><p><b>C (Carry) flag</b> &minus; If arithmetic operation result is in a carry, the carry flag is set, otherwise it is reset.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Register section</h2>
<p>It is basically a storage device and transfers data from registers by using instructions.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Stack Pointer (SP)</b> &minus; The stack pointer is also a 16-bit register which is used as a memory pointer. It points to a memory location in Read/Write memory known as stack. In between execution of program, sometime data to be stored in stack. The beginning of the stack is defined by loading a 16-bit address in the stack pointer.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Program Counter (PC)</b> &minus; This 16-bit register deals with fourth operation to sequence the execution of instruction. This register is also a memory pointer.

<h2>Time and Control Section</h2>
<p>This unit is responsible to synchronize Microprocessor operation as per the clock pulse and to generate the control signals which are necessary for smooth communication between Microprocessor and peripherals devices. The RD bar and WR bar signals are synchronous pulses which indicates whether data is available on the data bus or not. The control unit is responsible to control the flow of data between microprocessor, memory and peripheral devices.</p>

<h2>Instruction Format</h2>
<p>Each instruction is represented by a sequence of bits within the computer. The instruction is divided into group of bits called field. The way instruction is expressed is known as instruction format. It is usually represented in the form of rectangular box. The instruction format may be of the following types.</p>
<h2>Variable Instruction Formats</h2>
<p>These are the instruction formats in which the instruction length varies on the basis of opcode &amp; address specifiers. For Example, VAX instruction vary between 1 and 53 bytes while X86 instruction vary between 1 and 17 bytes.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/variable_instruction_format.jpg" alt="Variable Instruction Format" />
<h3>Advantage</h3>
<p>These formats have good code density.</p>
<h3>Drawback</h3>
<p>These instruction formats are very difficult to decode and pipeline.</p>
<h2>Fixed Instruction Formats</h2>
<p>In this type of instruction format, all instructions are of same size. For Example, MIPS, Power PC, Alpha, ARM.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fixed_instruction_format.jpg" alt="Fixed Instruction Format" />
<h3>Advantage</h3>
<p>They are easy to decode &amp; pipeline.</p>
<h3>Drawback</h3>
<p>They don't have good code density.</p>
<h2>Hybrid Instruction Formats</h2>
<p>In this type of instruction formats, we have multiple format length specified by opcode. For example, IBM 360/70, MIPS 16, Thumb.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/hybrid_instruction_format.jpg" alt="Hybrid Instruction Format" />
<h3>Advantage</h3>
<p>These compromise between code density &amp; instruction of these type are very easy to decode.</p>
<h2>Addressing Modes</h2>
<p>Addressing mode provides different ways for accessing an address to given data to a processor. Operated data is stored in the memory location, each instruction required certain data on which it has to operate. There are various techniques to specify address of data. These techniques are called Addressing Modes.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Direct addressing mode</b> &minus; In the direct addressing mode, address of the operand is given in the instruction and data is available in the memory location which is provided in instruction. We will move this data in desired location.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Indirect addressing mode</b> &minus; In the indirect addressing mode, the instruction specifies a register which contain the address of the operand. Both internal RAM and external RAM can be accessed via indirect addressing mode.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Immediate addressing mode</b> &minus; In the immediate addressing mode, direct data is given in the operand which move the data in accumulator. It is very fast.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Relative addressing mode</b> &minus; In the relative address mode, the effective address is determined by the index mode by using the program counter in stead of general purpose processor register. This mode is called relative address mode.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Index addressing mode</b> &minus; In the index address mode, the effective address of the operand is generated by adding a content value to the contents of the register. This mode is called index address mode.</p></li>
