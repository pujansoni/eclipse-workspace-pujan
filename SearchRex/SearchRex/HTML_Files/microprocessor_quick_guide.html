<h1>Microprocessor - Overview</h1>
<p>Microprocessor is a controlling unit of a micro-computer, fabricated on a small chip capable of performing ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) operations and communicating with the other devices connected to it.</p>
<p>Microprocessor consists of an ALU, register array, and a control unit. ALU performs arithmetical and logical operations on the data received from the memory or an input device. Register array consists of registers identified by letters like B, C, D, E, H, L and accumulator. The control unit controls the flow of data and instructions within the computer.</p>
<h3>Block Diagram of a Basic Microcomputer</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/basic_microcomputer.jpg" alt="Basic Microcomputer" />
<h2>How does a Microprocessor Work?</h2>
<p>The microprocessor follows a sequence: Fetch, Decode, and then Execute.</p>
<p>Initially, the instructions are stored in the memory in a sequential order. The microprocessor fetches those instructions from the memory, then decodes it and executes those instructions till STOP instruction is reached. Later, it sends the result in binary to the output port. Between these processes, the register stores the temporarily data and ALU performs the computing functions.</p>
<h3>List of Terms Used in a Microprocessor</h3>
<p>Here is a list of some of the frequently used terms in a microprocessor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Instruction Set</b> &minus; It is the set of instructions that the microprocessor can understand.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Bandwidth</b> &minus; It is the number of bits processed in a single instruction.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Clock Speed</b> &minus; It determines the number of operations per second the processor can perform. It is expressed in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).It is also known as Clock Rate.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Word Length</b> &minus; It depends upon the width of internal data bus, registers, ALU, etc. An 8-bit microprocessor can process 8-bit data at a time. The word length ranges from 4 bits to 64 bits depending upon the type of the microcomputer.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Data Types</b> &minus; The microprocessor has multiple data type formats like binary, BCD, ASCII, signed and unsigned numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Features of a Microprocessor</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some of the most prominent features of any microprocessor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Cost-effective</b> &minus; The microprocessor chips are available at low prices and results its low cost.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>Size</b> &minus; The microprocessor is of small size chip, hence is portable.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Low Power Consumption</b> &minus; Microprocessors are manufactured by using metaloxide semiconductor technology, which has low power consumption.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>Versatility</b> &minus; The microprocessors are versatile as we can use the same chip in a number of applications by configuring the software program.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>Reliability</b> &minus; The failure rate of an IC in microprocessors is very low, hence it is reliable.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Microprocessor - Classification</h1>
<p>A microprocessor can be classified into three categories &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/classification_of_microprocessor.jpg" alt="Classification of Microprocessor" />
<h2>RISC Processor</h2>
<p>RISC stands for <b>Reduced Instruction Set Computer</b>. It is designed to reduce the execution time by simplifying the instruction set of the computer. Using RISC processors, each instruction requires only one clock cycle to execute results in uniform execution time. This reduces the efficiency as there are more lines of code, hence more RAM is needed to store the instructions. The compiler also has to work more to convert high-level language instructions into machine code.</p>
<p>Some of the RISC processors are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Power PC: 601, 604, 615, 620</li>
<li>DEC Alpha: 210642, 211066, 21068, 21164</li>
<li>MIPS: TS (R10000) RISC Processor</li>
<li>PA-RISC: HP 7100LC</li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture of RISC</h3>
<p>RISC microprocessor architecture uses highly-optimized set of instructions. It is used in portable devices like Apple iPod due to its power efficiency.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/architecture_of_risc.jpg" alt="Architecture of RISC" />
<h3>Characteristics of RISC</h3>
<p>The major characteristics of a RISC processor are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It consists of simple instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports various data-type formats.</p></li>
<li><p>It utilizes simple addressing modes and fixed length instructions for pipelining.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports register to use in any context.</p></li>
<li><p>One cycle execution time.</p></li>
<li><p>“LOAD” and “STORE” instructions are used to access the memory location.</p></li>
<li><p>It consists of larger number of registers.</p></li>
<li><p>It consists of less number of transistors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>CISC Processor</h2>
<p>CISC stands for <b>Complex Instruction Set Computer</b>. It is designed to minimize the number of instructions per program, ignoring the number of cycles per instruction. The emphasis is on building complex instructions directly into the hardware.</p>
<p>The compiler has to do very little work to translate a high-level language into assembly level language/machine code because the length of the code is relatively short, so very little RAM is required to store the instructions.</p>
<p>Some of the CISC Processors are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>IBM 370/168</li>
<li>VAX 11/780</li>
<li>Intel 80486</li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture of CISC</h3>
<p>Its architecture is designed to decrease the memory cost because more storage is needed in larger programs resulting in higher memory cost. To resolve this, the number of instructions per program can be reduced by embedding the number of operations in a single instruction.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/architecture_of_cisc.jpg" alt="Architecture of CISC" />
<h3>Characteristics of CISC</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Variety of addressing modes.</li>
<li>Larger number of instructions.</li>
<li>Variable length of instruction formats.</li>
<li>Several cycles may be required to execute one instruction.</li>
<li>Instruction-decoding logic is complex.</li>
<li>One instruction is required to support multiple addressing modes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Processors</h2>
<p>These are the processors which are designed for some special purposes. Few of the special processors are briefly discussed &minus;</p>
<h3>Coprocessor</h3>
<p>A coprocessor is a specially designed microprocessor, which can handle its particular function many times faster than the ordinary microprocessor.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; Math Coprocessor.</p>
<p>Some Intel math-coprocessors are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>8087-used with 8086</li>
<li>80287-used with 80286</li>
<li>80387-used with 80386</li>
</ul>
<h3>Input/Output Processor</h3>
<p>It is a specially designed microprocessor having a local memory of its own, which is used to control I/O devices with minimum CPU involvement.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>DMA (direct Memory Access) controller</li>
<li>Keyboard/mouse controller</li>
<li>Graphic display controller</li>
<li>SCSI port controller</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transputer (Transistor Computer)</h3>
<p>A transputer is a specially designed microprocessor with its own local memory and having links to connect one transputer to another transputer for inter-processor communications. It was first designed in 1980 by Inmos and is targeted to the utilization of VLSI technology.</p>
<p>A transputer can be used as a single processor system or can be connected to external links, which reduces the construction cost and increases the performance.</p>
<p><b>For example</b> &minus; 16-bit T212, 32-bit T425, the floating point (T800, T805 &amp; T9000) processors.</p>
<h3>DSP (Digital Signal Processor)</h3>
<p>This processor is specially designed to process the analog signals into a digital form. This is done by sampling the voltage level at regular time intervals and converting the voltage at that instant into a digital form. This process is performed by a circuit called an analogue to digital converter, A to D converter or ADC.</p>
<p>A DSP contains the following components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<h1>Microprocessor - 8085 Architecture</h1>
<p>8085 is pronounced as "eighty-eighty-five" microprocessor. It is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Intel in 1977 using NMOS technology.</p>
<p>It has the following configuration &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>8-bit data bus</li> 
<li>16-bit address bus, which can address upto 64KB</li> 
<li>A 16-bit program counter</li> 
<li>A 16-bit stack pointer</li> 
<li>Six 8-bit registers arranged in pairs: BC, DE, HL</li>

</ul>
<p>It is used in washing machines, microwave ovens, mobile phones, etc.</p>
<h2>8085 Microprocessor – Functional Units</h2>
<p>8085 consists of the following functional units &minus;</p>
<h3>Accumulator</h3>
<p>It is an 8-bit register used to perform arithmetic, logical, I/O &amp; LOAD/STORE operations. It is connected to internal data bus &amp; ALU.</p>
<h3>Arithmetic and logic unit</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, it performs arithmetic and logical operations like Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, etc. on 8-bit data.</p>
<h3>General purpose register</h3>
<p>There are 6 general purpose registers in 8085 processor, i.e. B, C, D, E, H &amp; L. Each register can hold 8-bit data.</p>
<p>These registers can work in pair to hold 16-bit data and their pairing combination is like B-C, D-E &amp; H-L.</p>
<h3>Program counter</h3>
<p>It is a 16-bit register used to store the memory address location of the next instruction to be executed. Microprocessor increments the program whenever an instruction is being executed, so that the program counter points to the memory address of the next instruction that is going to be executed.</p>
<h3>Stack pointer</h3>
<p>It is also a 16-bit register works like stack, which is always incremented/decremented by 2 during push &amp; pop operations.</p>
<h3>Temporary register</h3>
<p>It is an 8-bit register, which holds the temporary data of arithmetic and logical operations.</p>
<h3>Flag register</h3>
<p>It is an 8-bit register having five 1-bit flip-flops, which holds either 0 or 1 depending upon the result stored in the accumulator.</p>
<p>These are the set of 5 flip-flops &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Sign (S)</li> 
<li>Zero (Z)</li>

<h3>Instruction register and decoder</h3>
<p>It is an 8-bit register. When an instruction is fetched from memory then it is stored in the Instruction register. Instruction decoder decodes the information present in the Instruction register.</p>
<h3>Timing and control unit</h3>
<p>It provides timing and control signal to the microprocessor to perform operations. Following are the timing and control signals, which control external and internal circuits &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Control Signals: READY, RD’, WR’, ALE</li>
<li>Status Signals: S0, S1, IO/M’</li> 
<li>DMA Signals: HOLD, HLDA</li>
<li>RESET Signals: RESET IN, RESET OUT</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interrupt control</h3>
<p>As the name suggests it controls the interrupts during a process. When a microprocessor is executing a main program and whenever an interrupt occurs, the microprocessor shifts the control from the main program to process the incoming request. After the request is completed, the control goes back to the main program.</p>
<p>There are 5 interrupt signals in 8085 microprocessor: INTR, RST 7.5, RST 6.5, RST 5.5, TRAP.</p>
<h3>Serial Input/output control</h3>
<p>It controls the serial data communication by using these two instructions: SID (Serial input data) and SOD (Serial output data).</p>
<h3>Address buffer and address-data buffer</h3>
<p>The content stored in the stack pointer and program counter is loaded into the address buffer and address-data buffer to communicate with the CPU. The memory and I/O chips are connected to these buses; the CPU can exchange the desired data with the memory and I/O chips.</p>
<h3>Address bus and data bus</h3>
<p>Data bus carries the data to be stored. It is bidirectional, whereas address bus carries the location to where it should be stored and it is unidirectional. It is used to transfer the data &amp; Address I/O devices.</p>

<p>Three control signals are RD, WR &amp; ALE.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>RD</b> &minus; This signal indicates that the selected IO or memory device is to be read and is ready for accepting data available on the data bus.</p></li>
<li><p><b>WR</b> &minus; This signal indicates that the data on the data bus is to be written into a selected memory or IO location.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ALE</b> &minus; It is a positive going pulse generated when a new operation is started by the microprocessor. When the pulse goes high, it indicates address. When the pulse goes down it indicates data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Three status signals are IO/M, S0 &amp; S1.</p>

<li><p><b>SID</b> (Serial input data line) &minus; The data on this line is loaded into accumulator whenever a RIM instruction is executed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>8085 Addressing Modes &amp; Interrupts</h1>
<p>Now let us discuss the addressing modes in 8085 Microprocessor.</p>
<h2>Addressing Modes in 8085</h2>
<p>These are the instructions used to transfer the data from one register to another register, from the memory to the register, and from the register to the memory without any alteration in the content. Addressing modes in 8085 is classified into 5 groups &minus;</p>
<h3>Immediate addressing mode</h3>
<p>In this mode, the 8/16-bit data is specified in the instruction itself as one of its operand. <b>For example:</b> MVI K, 20F: means 20F is copied into register K.</p>
<h3>Register addressing mode</h3>
<p>In this mode, the data is copied from one register to another. <b>For example:</b> MOV K, B: means data in register B is copied to register K.</p>
<h3>Direct addressing mode</h3>
<p>In this mode, the data is directly copied from the given address to the register. <b>For example:</b> LDB 5000K: means the data at address 5000K is copied to register B.</p>
<h3>Indirect addressing mode</h3>
<p>In this mode, the data is transferred from one register to another by using the address pointed by the register. <b>For example:</b> MOV K, B: means data is transferred from the memory address pointed by the register to the register K.</p>
<h3>Implied addressing mode</h3>
<p>This mode doesn’t require any operand; the data is specified by the opcode itself. <b>For example:</b> CMP.</p>
<h2>Interrupts in 8085</h2>
<p>Interrupts are the signals generated by the external devices to request the microprocessor to perform a task. There are 5 interrupt signals, i.e. TRAP, RST 7.5, RST 6.5, RST 5.5, and INTR.</p>
<p>Interrupt are classified into following groups based on their parameter &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Vector interrupt</b> &minus; In this type of interrupt, the interrupt address is known to the processor. <b>For example:</b> RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5, TRAP.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Non-Vector interrupt</b> &minus; In this type of interrupt, the interrupt address is not known to the processor so, the interrupt address needs to be sent externally by the device to perform interrupts. <b>For example:</b> INTR.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>Maskable interrupt</b> &minus; In this type of interrupt, we can disable the interrupt by writing some instructions into the program. <b>For example:</b> RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Non-Maskable interrupt</b> &minus; In this type of interrupt, we cannot disable the interrupt by writing some instructions into the program. <b>For example:</b> TRAP.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Software interrupt</b> &minus; In this type of interrupt, the programmer has to add the instructions into the program to execute the interrupt. There are 8 software interrupts in 8085, i.e. RST0, RST1, RST2, RST3, RST4, RST5, RST6, and RST7.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Hardware interrupt</b> &minus; There are 5 interrupt pins in 8085 used as hardware interrupts, i.e. TRAP, RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5, INTA.</p></li> 
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; NTA is not an interrupt, it is used by the microprocessor for sending acknowledgement. TRAP has the highest priority, then RST7.5 and so on.</p>
<h3>Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</h3>
<p>A small program or a routine that when executed, services the corresponding interrupting source is called an ISR.</p>
<h3>TRAP</h3>
<p>It is a non-maskable interrupt, having the highest priority among all interrupts. Bydefault, it is enabled until it gets acknowledged. In case of failure, it executes as ISR and sends the data to backup memory. This interrupt transfers the control to the location 0024H.</p>
<h3>RST7.5</h3>
<p>It is a maskable interrupt, having the second highest priority among all interrupts. When this interrupt is executed, the processor saves the content of the PC register into the stack and branches to 003CH address.</p>
<h3>RST 6.5</h3>
<p>It is a maskable interrupt, having the third highest priority among all interrupts. When this interrupt is executed, the processor saves the content of the PC register into the stack and branches to 0034H address.</p>
<h3>RST 5.5</h3>
<p>It is a maskable interrupt. When this interrupt is executed, the processor saves the content of the PC register into the stack and branches to 002CH address.</p>
<h3>INTR</h3>
<p>It is a maskable interrupt, having the lowest priority among all interrupts. It can be disabled by resetting the microprocessor.</p>
<p>When <b>INTR signal goes high</b>, the following events can occur &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The microprocessor checks the status of INTR signal during the execution of each instruction.</p></li>  
<li><p>When the INTR signal is high, then the microprocessor completes its current instruction and sends active low interrupt acknowledge signal.</p></li>  
<li><p>When instructions are received, then the microprocessor saves the address of the next instruction on stack and executes the received instruction.</p></li> 
</ul>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/architecture_of_8086.jpg" alt="Architecture of 8086" />
<h1>Microprocessor - 8086 Functional Units</h1>
<p>8086 Microprocessor is divided into two functional units, i.e., <b>EU</b> (Execution Unit) and <b>BIU</b> (Bus Interface Unit).</p>
<h2>EU (Execution Unit)</h2>
<p>Execution unit gives instructions to BIU stating from where to fetch the data and then decode and execute those instructions. Its function is to control operations on data using the instruction decoder &amp; ALU. EU has no direct connection with system buses as shown in the above figure, it performs operations over data through BIU.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the functional parts of 8086 microprocessors.</p>
<h3>ALU</h3>
<p>It handles all arithmetic and logical operations, like &plus;, &minus;, &times;, /, OR, AND, NOT operations.</p>
<h3>Flag Register</h3>
<p>It is a 16-bit register that behaves like a flip-flop, i.e. it changes its status according to the result stored in the accumulator. It has 9 flags and they are divided into 2 groups</b> &minus; Conditional Flags and Control Flags.</p>
<h3>Conditional Flags</h3>
<p>It represents the result of the last arithmetic or logical instruction executed.  Following is the list of conditional flags &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Carry flag</b> &minus; This flag indicates an overflow condition for arithmetic operations.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Auxiliary flag</b> &minus; When an operation is performed at ALU, it results in a carry/barrow from lower nibble (i.e. D0 – D3) to upper nibble (i.e. D4 – D7), then this flag is set, i.e. carry given by D3 bit to D4 is AF flag. The processor uses this flag to perform binary to BCD conversion.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Parity flag</b> &minus; This flag is used to indicate the parity of the result, i.e. when the lower order 8-bits of the result contains even number of 1’s, then the Parity Flag is set. For odd number of 1’s, the Parity Flag is reset.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Zero flag</b> &minus; This flag is set to 1 when the result of arithmetic or logical operation is zero else it is set to 0.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Sign flag</b> &minus; This flag holds the sign of the result, i.e. when the result of the operation is negative, then the sign flag is set to 1 else set to 0.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Overflow flag</b> &minus; This flag represents the result when the system capacity is exceeded.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h3>Control Flags</h3>
<p>Control flags controls the operations of the execution unit. Following is the list of control flags &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Trap flag</b> &minus; It is used for single step control and allows the user to execute one instruction at a time for debugging. If it is set, then the program can be run in a single step mode.</p></li>   
<li><p><b>Interrupt flag</b> &minus; It is an interrupt enable/disable flag, i.e. used to allow/prohibit the interruption of a program. It is set to 1 for interrupt enabled condition and set to 0 for interrupt disabled condition.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Direction flag</b> &minus; It is used in string operation. As the name suggests when it is set then string bytes are accessed from the higher memory address to the lower memory address and vice-a-versa.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h3>General purpose register</h3>
<p>There are 8 general purpose registers, i.e., AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL. These registers can be used individually to store 8-bit data and can be used in pairs to store 16bit data. The valid register pairs are AH and AL, BH and BL, CH and CL, and DH and DL. It is referred to the AX, BX, CX, and DX respectively.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>AX register</b> &minus; It is also known as accumulator register. It is used to store operands for arithmetic operations.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>BX register</b> &minus; It is used as a base register. It is used to store the starting base address of the memory area within the data segment.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>CX register</b> &minus; It is referred to as counter. It is used in loop instruction to store the loop counter.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>DX register</b> &minus; This register is used to hold I/O port address for I/O instruction.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h3>Stack pointer register</h3>
<p>It is a 16-bit register, which holds the address from the start of the segment to the memory location, where a word was most recently stored on the stack.</p>
<h2>BIU (Bus Interface Unit)</h2>
<p>BIU takes care of all data and addresses transfers on the buses for the EU like sending addresses, fetching instructions from the memory, reading data from the ports and the memory as well as writing data to the ports and the memory. EU has no direction connection with System Buses so this is possible with the BIU. EU and BIU are connected with the Internal Bus.</p>
<p>It has the following functional parts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Instruction queue</b> &minus; BIU contains the instruction queue. BIU gets upto 6 bytes of next instructions and stores them in the instruction queue. When EU executes instructions and is ready for its next instruction, then it simply reads the instruction from this instruction queue resulting in increased execution speed.</p></li>

<h1>Microprocessor - 8086 Interrupts</h1>
<p><b>Interrupt</b> is the method of creating a temporary halt during program execution and allows peripheral devices to access the microprocessor. The microprocessor responds to that interrupt with an <b>ISR</b> (Interrupt Service Routine), which is a short program to instruct the microprocessor on how to handle the interrupt.</p>
<p>The following image shows the types of interrupts we have in a 8086 microprocessor &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/interrupts.jpg" alt="Interrupts" />
<h2>Hardware Interrupts</h2>
<p>Hardware interrupt is caused by any peripheral device by sending a signal through a specified pin to the microprocessor.</p>
<p>The 8086 has two hardware interrupt pins, i.e. NMI and INTR. NMI is a non-maskable interrupt and INTR is a maskable interrupt having lower priority. One more interrupt pin associated is INTA called interrupt acknowledge.</p>
<h3>NMI</h3>
<p>It is a single non-maskable interrupt pin (NMI) having higher priority than the maskable interrupt request pin (INTR)and it is of type 2 interrupt.</p>
<p>When this interrupt is activated, these actions take place &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Completes the current instruction that is in progress.</p></li>  
<li><p>Pushes the Flag register values on to the stack.</p></li>  
<li><p>Pushes the CS (code segment) value and IP (instruction pointer) value of the return address on to the stack.</p></li>  
<li><p>IP is loaded from the contents of the word location 00008H.</p></li> 
<li><p>CS is loaded from the contents of the next word location 0000AH.</p></li>  
<li><p>Interrupt flag and trap flag are reset to 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>INTR</h3>
<p>The INTR is a maskable interrupt because the microprocessor will be interrupted only if interrupts are enabled using set interrupt flag instruction. It should not be enabled using clear interrupt Flag instruction.</p>
<p>The INTR interrupt is activated by an I/O port. If the interrupt is enabled and NMI is disabled, then the microprocessor first completes the current execution and sends ‘0’ on INTA pin twice. The first ‘0’ means INTA informs the external device to get ready and during the second ‘0’ the microprocessor receives the 8 bit, say X, from the programmable interrupt controller.</p>
<p>These actions are taken by the microprocessor &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>First completes the current instruction.</p></li>  
<li><p>Activates INTA output and receives the interrupt type, say X.</p></li>  
<li><p>Flag register value, CS value of the return address and IP value of the return address are pushed on to the stack.</p></li>  
<li><p>IP value is loaded from the contents of word location X &times; 4</p></li>  
<li><p>CS is loaded from the contents of the next word location.</p></li>  
<li><p>Interrupt flag and trap flag is reset to 0</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Software Interrupts</h2>
<p>Some instructions are inserted at the desired position into the program to create interrupts. These interrupt instructions can be used to test the working of various interrupt handlers. It includes &minus;</p>
<h3>INT- Interrupt instruction with type number</h3>
<p>It is 2-byte instruction. First byte provides the op-code and the second byte provides the interrupt type number. There are 256 interrupt types under this group.</p>
<p>Its execution includes the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Flag register value is pushed on to the stack.</p></li>  
<li><p>CS value of the return address and IP value of the return address are pushed on to the stack.</p></li>  
<li><p>IP is loaded from the contents of the word location ‘type number’ &times; 4</p></li>  
<li><p>CS is loaded from the contents of the next word location.</p></li>
<li><p>Interrupt Flag and Trap Flag are reset to 0</p></li> 
</ul>
<p>The starting address for type0 interrupt is 000000H, for type1 interrupt is 00004H similarly for type2 is 00008H and ……so on. The first five pointers are dedicated interrupt pointers. i.e. &minus;</p>

<p>The interrupts from Type 5 to Type 31 are reserved for other advanced microprocessors, and interrupts from 32 to Type 255 are available for hardware and software interrupts.</p>
<h3>INT 3-Break Point Interrupt Instruction</h3>
<p>It is a 1-byte instruction having op-code is CCH. These instructions are inserted into the program so that when the processor reaches there, then it stops the normal execution of program and follows the break-point procedure.</p>
<p>Its execution includes the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Flag register value is pushed on to the stack.</p></li>   
<li><p>CS value of the return address and IP value of the return address are pushed on to the stack.</p></li>  
<li><p>IP is loaded from the contents of the word location 3&times;4 = 0000CH</p></li>  
<li><p>CS is loaded from the contents of the next word location.</p></li>  
<li><p>Interrupt Flag and Trap Flag are reset to 0</p></li> 
</ul>
<h3>INTO - Interrupt on overflow instruction</h3>
<p>It is a 1-byte instruction and their mnemonic <b>INTO</b>. The op-code for this instruction is CEH. As the name suggests it is a conditional interrupt instruction, i.e. it is active only when the overflow flag is set to 1 and branches to the interrupt handler whose interrupt type number is 4. If the overflow flag is reset then, the execution continues to the next instruction.</p>
<p>Its execution includes the following steps &minus;</p>

<h1>Microprocessor - 8086 Addressing Modes</h1>
<p>The different ways in which a source operand is denoted in an instruction is known as <b>addressing modes</b>. There are 8 different addressing modes in 8086 programming &minus;</p>
<h2>Immediate addressing mode</h2>
<p>The addressing mode in which the data operand is a part of the instruction itself is known as immediate addressing mode.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV CX, 4929 H, ADD AX, 2387 H,  MOV AL, FFH 
</pre>
<h2>Register addressing mode</h2>
<p>It means that the register is the source of an operand for an instruction.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV CX, AX   ; copies the contents of the 16-bit AX register into  
             ; the 16-bit CX register),  
ADD BX, AX 
</pre>
<h2>Direct addressing mode</h2>
<p>The addressing mode in which the effective address of the memory location is written directly in the instruction.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV AX, [1592H], MOV AL, [0300H]
</pre>
<h2>Register indirect addressing mode</h2>
<p>This addressing mode allows data to be addressed at any memory location through an offset address held in any of the following registers: BP, BX, DI &amp; SI.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV AX, [BX]  ; Suppose the register BX contains 4895H, then the contents  
              ; 4895H are moved to AX 
ADD CX, {BX} 
</pre>
<h2>Based addressing mode</h2>
<p>In this addressing mode, the offset address of the operand is given by the sum of contents of the BX/BP registers and 8-bit/16-bit displacement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV DX, [BX+04], ADD CL, [BX+08]
</pre>
<h2>Indexed addressing mode</h2>
<p>In this addressing mode, the operands offset address is found by adding the contents of SI or DI register and 8-bit/16-bit displacements.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV BX, [SI+16], ADD AL, [DI+16] 
</pre>
<h2>Based-index addressing mode</h2>
<p>In this addressing mode, the offset address of the operand is computed by summing the base register to the contents of an Index register.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ADD CX, [AX+SI], MOV AX, [AX+DI] 
</pre>
<h2>Based indexed with displacement mode</h2>
<p>In this addressing mode, the operands offset is computed by adding the base register contents. An Index registers contents and 8 or 16-bit displacement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
MOV AX, [BX+DI+08], ADD CX, [BX+SI+16] 
</pre>
<h1>Multiprocessor Configuration Overview</h1>
<p>Multiprocessor means a multiple set of processors that executes instructions simultaneously. There are three basic multiprocessor configurations.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Coprocessor configuration</li>
<li>Closely coupled configuration</li>
<li>Loosely coupled configuration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coprocessor Configuration</h2>
<p>A Coprocessor is a specially designed circuit on microprocessor chip which can perform the same task very quickly, which the microprocessor performs. It reduces the work load of the main processor. The coprocessor shares the same memory, IO system, bus, control logic and clock generator. The coprocessor handles specialized tasks like mathematical calculations, graphical display on screen, etc.</p>
<p>The 8086 and 8088 can perform most of the operations but their instruction set is not able to perform complex mathematical operations, so in these cases the microprocessor requires the math coprocessor like Intel 8087 math coprocessor, which can easily perform these operations very quickly.</p>
<h3>Block Diagram of Coprocessor Configuration</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/coprocessor_configuration.jpg" alt="Coprocessor Configuration" />
<h3>How is the coprocessor and the processor connected?</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The coprocessor and the processor is connected via TEST, RQ-/GT- and QS<sub>0</sub> &amp; QS<sub>1</sub> signals.</p></li>  
<li><p>The TEST signal is connected to BUSY pin of coprocessor and the remaining 3 pins are connected to the coprocessor’s 3 pins of the same name.</p></li>  
<li><p>TEST signal takes care of the coprocessor’s activity, i.e. the coprocessor is busy or idle.</p></li>  
<li><p>The RT-/GT-is used for bus arbitration.</p></li>  
<li><p>The coprocessor uses QS<sub>0</sub> &amp; QS<sub>1</sub> to track the status of the queue of the host processor.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Closely Coupled Configuration</h2>
<p>Closely coupled configuration is similar to the coprocessor configuration, i.e. both share the same memory, I/O system bus, control logic, and control generator with the host processor. However, the coprocessor and the host processor fetches and executes their own instructions. The system bus is controlled by the coprocessor and the host processor independently.</p>
<h3>Block Diagram of Closely Coupled Configuration</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/closely_coupled_configuration.jpg" alt="Closely Coupled Configuration" />
<h3>How is the processor and the independent processor connected?</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Communication between the host and the independent processor is done through memory space.</p></li>  
<li><p>None of the instructions are used for communication, like WAIT, ESC, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The host processor manages the memory and wakes up the independent processor by sending commands to one of its ports.</p></li>   
<li><p>Then the independent processor accesses the memory to execute the task.</p></li> 
<li><p>After completion of the task, it sends an acknowledgement to the host processor by using the status signal or an interrupt request.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Loosely Coupled Configuration</h2>
<p>Loosely coupled configuration consists of the number of modules of the microprocessor based systems, which are connected through a common system bus. Each module consists of their own clock generator, memory, I/O devices and are connected through a local bus.</p>
<h3>Block Diagram of Loosely Coupled Configuration</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/loosely_coupled_configuration.jpg" alt="Loosely Coupled Configuration" />
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Having more than one processor results in increased efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the processors have their own local bus to access the local memory/I/O devices. This makes it easy to achieve parallel processing.</p></li>
<li><p>The system structure is flexible, i.e. the failure of one module doesn’t affect the whole system failure; faulty module can be replaced later.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>8087 Numeric Data Processor</h1>
<p>8087 numeric data processor is also known as <b>Math co-processor, Numeric processor extension</b> and <b>Floating point unit</b>. It was the first math coprocessor designed by Intel to pair with 8086/8088 resulting in easier and faster calculation.</p>
<p>Once the instructions are identified by the 8086/8088 processor, then it is allotted to the 8087 co-processor for further execution.</p>
<p>The data types supported by 8087 are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Binary Integers</li>

<li><p>It supports data of type integer, float, and real types ranging from 2-10 bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>The processing speed is so high that it can calculate multiplication of two 64-bits real numbers in ~27 µs and can also calculate square-root in ~35 µs.</p></li>
<li><p>It follows IEEE floating point standards.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>8087 Architecture</h2>
<p>8087 Architecture is divided into two groups, i.e., <b>Control Unit</b> (CU) and <b>Numeric Extension Unit</b> (NEU).</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>control unit</b> handles all the communication between the processor and the  memory such as it receives and decodes instructions, reads and writes memory operands, maintains parallel queue, etc. All the coprocessor instructions are ESC instructions, i.e., they start with ‘F’, the coprocessor only executes the ESC instructions while other instructions are executed by the microprocessor.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>numeric extension unit</b> handles all the numeric processor instructions like arithmetic, logical, transcendental, and data transfer instructions. It has 8 register stack, which holds the operands for instructions and their results.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Microprocessor - I/O Interfacing Overview</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss Memory Interfacing and IO Interfacing with 8085.</p>
<p><b>Interface</b> is the path for communication between two components. Interfacing is of two types, memory interfacing and I/O interfacing.</p>
<h2>Memory Interfacing</h2>
<p>When we are executing any instruction, we need the microprocessor to access the memory for reading instruction codes and the data stored in the memory. For this, both the memory and the microprocessor requires some signals to read from and write to registers.</p>
<p>The interfacing process includes some key factors to match with the memory requirements and microprocessor signals. The interfacing circuit therefore should be designed in such a way that it matches the memory signal requirements with the signals of the microprocessor.</p>
<h2>IO Interfacing</h2>
<p>There are various communication devices like the keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. So, we need to interface the keyboard and other devices with the microprocessor by using latches and buffers. This type of interfacing is known as I/O interfacing.</p>
<h2>Block Diagram of Memory and I/O Interfacing</h2>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/interfacing.jpg" alt="Interfacing" />
<h2>8085 Interfacing Pins</h2>
<p>Following is the list of 8085 pins used for interfacing with other devices &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>A<sub>15</sub> - A<sub>8</sub> (Higher Address Bus)</li> 
<li>AD<sub>7</sub> - AD<sub>0</sub>(Lower Address/Data Bus)</li> 
<li>ALE</li> 
<li>RD</li> 
<li>WR</li> 
<li>READY</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Ways of Communication − Microprocessor with the Outside World?</h2>
<p>There are two ways of communication in which the microprocessor can connect with the outside world.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Serial Communication Interface</li>
<li>Parallel Communication interface</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Serial Communication Interface</b> &minus; In this type of communication, the interface gets a single byte of data from the microprocessor and sends it bit by bit to the other system serially and vice-a-versa.</p>
<p><b>Parallel Communication Interface</b> &minus; In this type of communication, the interface gets a byte of data from the microprocessor and sends it bit by bit to the other systems in simultaneous (or) parallel fashion and vice-a-versa.</p>
<h1>8279 - Programmable Keyboard</h1>
<p>8279 programmable keyboard/display controller is designed by Intel that interfaces a keyboard with the CPU. The keyboard first scans the keyboard and identifies if any key has been pressed. It then sends their relative response of the pressed key to the CPU and vice-a-versa.</p>
<h3>How Many Ways the Keyboard is Interfaced with the CPU?</h3>
<p>The Keyboard can be interfaced either in the interrupt or the polled mode. In the <b>Interrupt mode</b>, the processor is requested service only if any key is pressed, otherwise the CPU will continue with its main task.</p>
<p>In the <b>Polled mode</b>, the CPU periodically reads an internal flag of 8279 to check whether any key is pressed or not with key pressure.</p>
<h3>How Does 8279 Keyboard Work?</h3>
<p>The keyboard consists of maximum 64 keys, which are interfaced with the CPU by using the key-codes. These key-codes are de-bounced and stored in an 8-byte FIFORAM, which can be accessed by the CPU. If more than 8 characters are entered in the FIFO, then it means more than eight keys are pressed at a time. This is when the overrun status is set.</p>
<p>If a FIFO contains a valid key entry, then the CPU is interrupted in an interrupt mode else the CPU checks the status in polling to read the entry. Once the CPU reads a key entry, then FIFO is updated, and the key entry is pushed out of the FIFO to generate space for new entries.</p>
<h3>Architecture and Description</h3>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/8279_architecture.jpg" alt="8279 Architecture" />
<h3>I/O Control and Data Buffer</h3>
<p>This unit controls the flow of data through the microprocessor. It is enabled only when D is low. Its data buffer interfaces the external bus of the system with the internal bus of the microprocessor. The pins A0, RD, and WR are used for command, status or data read/write operations.</p>
<h3>Control and Timing Register and Timing Control</h3>
<p>This unit contains registers to store the keyboard, display modes, and other operations as programmed by the CPU. The timing and control unit handles the timings for the operation of the circuit.</p>
<h3>Scan Counter</h3>
<p>It has two modes i.e. <b>Encoded mode</b> and Decoded mode. In the encoded mode, the counter provides the binary count that is to be externally decoded to provide the scan lines for the keyboard and display.</p>
<p>In the <b>decoded scan mode</b>, the counter internally decodes the least significant 2 bits and provides a decoded 1 out of 4 scan on SL<sub>0</sub>-SL<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<h3>Return Buffers, Keyboard Debounce, and Control</h3>
<p>This unit first scans the key closure row-wise, if found then the keyboard debounce unit debounces the key entry. In case, the same key is detected, then the code of that key is directly transferred to the sensor RAM along with SHIFT &amp; CONTROL key status.</p>
<h3>FIFO/Sensor RAM and Status Logic</h3>
<p>This unit acts as 8-byte first-in-first-out (FIFO) RAM where the key code of every pressed key is entered into the RAM as per their sequence. The status logic generates an interrupt request after each FIFO read operation till the FIFO gets empty.</p>
<p>In the scanned sensor matrix mode, this unit acts as sensor RAM where its each row is loaded with the status of their corresponding row of sensors into the matrix. When the sensor changes its state, the IRQ line changes to high and interrupts the CPU.</p>
<h3>Display Address Registers and Display RAM</h3>
<p>This unit consists of display address registers which holds the addresses of the word currently read/written by the CPU to/from the display RAM.</p>
<h3>8279 − Pin Description</h3>
<p>The following figure shows the pin diagram of 8279 &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/8279_pin_diagram.jpg" alt="8279 Pin Diagram"/>
<h3>Data Bus Lines, DB<sub>0</sub> - DB<sub>7</sub></h3>
<p>These are 8 bidirectional data bus lines used to transfer the data to/from the CPU.</p>
<h3>CLK</h3>
<p>The clock input is used to generate internal timings required by the microprocessor.</p>
<h3>RESET</h3>
<p>As the name suggests this pin is used to reset the microprocessor.</p>
<h3>CS Chip Select</h3>
<p>When this pin is set to low, it allows read/write operations, else this pin should be set to high.</p>
<h3>A<sub>0</sub></h3>
<p>This pin indicates the transfer of command/status information. When it is low, it indicates the transfer of data.</p>
<h3>RD, WR</h3>
<p>This Read/Write pin enables the data buffer to send/receive data over the data bus.</p>
<h3>IRQ</h3>
<p>This interrupt output line goes high when there is data in the FIFO sensor RAM. The interrupt line goes low with each FIFO RAM read operation. However, if the FIFO RAM further contains any key-code entry to be read by the CPU, this pin again goes high to generate an interrupt to the CPU.</p>
<h3>V<sub>ss</sub>, V<sub>cc</sub></h3>
<p>These are the ground and power supply lines of the microprocessor.</p>
<h3>SL<sub>0</sub> − SL<sub>3</sub></h3>
<p>These are the scan lines used to scan the keyboard matrix and display the digits. These lines can be programmed as encoded or decoded, using the mode control register.</p>
<h3>RL<sub>0</sub> − RL<sub>7</sub></h3>
<p>These are the Return Lines which are connected to one terminal of keys, while the other terminal of the keys is connected to the decoded scan lines. These lines are set to 0 when any key is pressed.</p>
<h3>SHIFT</h3>
<p>The Shift input line status is stored along with every key code in FIFO in the scanned keyboard mode. Till it is pulled low with a key closure, it is pulled up internally to keep it high</p>
<h3>CNTL/STB - CONTROL/STROBED I/P Mode</h3>
<p>In the keyboard mode, this line is used as a control input and stored in FIFO on a key closure. The line is a strobe line that enters the data into FIFO RAM, in the strobed input mode. It has an internal pull up. The line is pulled down with a key closure.</p>
<h3>BD</h3>
<p>It stands for blank display. It is used to blank the display during digit switching.</p>
<h3>OUTA<sub>0</sub> – OUTA<sub>3</sub> and OUTB<sub>0</sub> – OUTB<sub>3</sub></h3>
<p>These are the output ports for two 16x4 or one 16x8 internal display refresh registers. The data from these lines is synchronized with the scan lines to scan the display and the keyboard.</p>
<h2>Operational Modes of 8279</h2>
<p>There are two modes of operation on 8279 &minus; <b>Input Mode</b> and <b>Output Mode</b>.</p>
<h3>Input Mode</h3>
<p>This mode deals with the input given by the keyboard and this mode is further classified into 3 modes.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Scanned Keyboard Mode</b> &minus; In this mode, the key matrix can be interfaced using either encoded or decoded scans. In the encoded scan, an 8&times;8 keyboard or in the decoded scan, a 4&times;8 keyboard can be interfaced. The code of key pressed with SHIFT and CONTROL status is stored into the FIFO RAM.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Scanned Sensor Matrix</b> &minus; In this mode, a sensor array can be interfaced with the processor using either encoder or decoder scans. In the encoder scan, 8&times;8 sensor matrix or with decoder scan 4&times;8 sensor matrix can be interfaced.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Strobed Input</b> &minus; In this mode, when the control line is set to 0, the data on the return lines is stored in the FIFO byte by byte.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Output Mode</h3>
<p>This mode deals with display-related operations. This mode is further classified into two output modes.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Display Scan</b> &minus; This mode allows 8/16 character multiplexed displays to be organized as dual 4-bit/single 8-bit display units.</p></li>  
<li><p><b>Display Entry</b> &minus; This mode allows the data to be entered for display either from the right side/left side.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Microprocessor - 8257 DMA Controller</h1>
<p>DMA stands for Direct Memory Access. It is designed by Intel to transfer data at the fastest rate. It allows the device to transfer the data directly to/from memory without any interference of the CPU.</p>
<p>Using a DMA controller, the device requests the CPU to hold its data, address and control bus, so the device is free to transfer data directly to/from the memory. The DMA data transfer is initiated only after receiving HLDA signal from the CPU.</p>
<h2>How DMA Operations are Performed?</h2>
<p>Following is the sequence of operations performed by a DMA &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Initially, when any device has to send data between the device and the memory, the device has to send DMA request (DRQ) to DMA controller.</p></li>
<li><p>The DMA controller sends Hold request (HRQ) to the CPU and waits for the CPU to assert the HLDA.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the microprocessor tri-states all the data bus, address bus, and control bus. The CPU leaves the control over bus and acknowledges the HOLD request through HLDA signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the CPU is in HOLD state and the DMA controller has to manage the operations over buses between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Features of 8257</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some of the prominent features of 8257 &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It has four channels which can be used over four I/O devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Each channel has 16-bit address and 14-bit counter.</p></li>
<li><p>Each channel can transfer data up to 64kb.</p></li>
<li><p>Each channel can be programmed independently.</p></li>
<li><p>Each channel can perform read transfer, write transfer and verify transfer operations.</p></li>
<li><p>It generates MARK signal to the peripheral device that 128 bytes have been transferred.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires a single phase clock.</p></li>
<li><p>Its frequency ranges from 250Hz to 3MHz.</p></li>
<li><p>It operates in 2 modes, i.e., <b>Master mode</b> and <b>Slave mode</b>.</p></li>

<h1>Microcontrollers - 8051 Architecture</h1>
<p>8051 microcontroller is designed by Intel in 1981. It is an 8-bit microcontroller. It is built with 40 pins DIP (dual inline package), 4kb of ROM storage and 128 bytes of RAM storage, 2 16-bit timers. It consists of are four parallel 8-bit ports, which are programmable as well as addressable as per the requirement. An on-chip crystal oscillator is integrated in the microcontroller having crystal frequency of 12 MHz.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the architecture of 8051 Microcontroller.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, the system bus connects all the support devices to the CPU. The system bus consists of an 8-bit data bus, a 16-bit address bus and bus control signals. All other devices like program memory, ports, data memory, serial interface, interrupt control, timers, and the CPU are all interfaced together through the system bus.</p>

<h1>Microcontrollers - 8051 Pin Description</h1>
<p>The pin diagram of 8051 microcontroller looks as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/images/8051_pin_diagram.jpg" alt="8051 Pin Diagram" />
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Pins 1 to 8</b> &minus; These pins are known as Port 1. This port doesn’t serve any other functions. It is internally pulled up, bi-directional I/O port.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pin 9</b> &minus; It is a RESET pin, which is used to reset the microcontroller to its initial values.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pins 10 to 17</b> &minus; These pins are known as Port 3. This port serves some functions like interrupts, timer input, control signals, serial communication signals RxD and TxD, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pins 18 &amp; 19</b> &minus; These pins are used for interfacing an external crystal to get the system clock.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pin 20</b> &minus; This pin provides the power supply to the circuit.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pins 21 to 28</b> &minus; These pins are known as Port 2.  It serves as I/O port. Higher order address bus signals are also multiplexed using this port.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pin 29</b> &minus; This is PSEN pin which stands for Program Store Enable. It is used to read a signal from the external program memory.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pin 30</b> &minus; This is EA pin which stands for External Access input. It is used to enable/disable the external memory interfacing.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pin 31</b> &minus; This is ALE pin which stands for Address Latch Enable. It is used to demultiplex the address-data signal of port.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pins 32 to 39</b> &minus; These pins are known as Port 0. It serves as I/O port. Lower order address and data bus signals are multiplexed using this port.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Pin 40</b> &minus; This pin is used to provide power supply to the circuit.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h1>Microcontrollers 8051 Input Output Ports</h1>
<p>8051 microcontrollers have 4 I/O ports each of 8-bit, which can be configured as input or output. Hence, total 32 input/output pins allow the microcontroller to be connected with the peripheral devices.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Pin configuration</b>, i.e. the pin can be configured as 1 for input and 0 for output as per the logic state.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Input/Output (I/O) pin</b> &minus; All the circuits within the microcontroller must be connected to one of its pins except P0 port because it does not have pull-up resistors built-in.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Input pin</b> &minus; Logic 1 is applied to a bit of the P register. The output FE transistor is turned off and the other pin remains connected to the power supply voltage over a pull-up resistor of high resistance.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>  
<li><p><b>Port 0</b> &minus; The P0 (zero) port is characterized by two functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">  
<li><p>When the external memory is used then the lower address byte (addresses A0A7) is applied on it, else all bits of this port are configured as input/output.</p></li>
<li><p>When P0 port is configured as an output then other ports consisting of pins with built-in pull-up resistor connected by its end to 5V power supply, the pins of this port have this resistor left out.</p></li>
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Input Configuration</h3>
<p>If any pin of this port is configured as an input, then it acts as if it “floats”, i.e. the input has unlimited input resistance and in-determined potential.</p>
<h3>Output Configuration</h3>
<p>When the pin is configured as an output, then it acts as an “open drain”. By applying logic 0 to a port bit, the appropriate pin will be connected to ground (0V), and applying logic 1, the external output will keep on “floating”.</p>
<p>In order to apply logic 1 (5V) on this output pin, it is necessary to build an external pullup resistor.</p>
<h3>Port 1</h3>
<p>P1 is a true I/O port as it doesn’t have any alternative functions as in P0, but this port can be configured as general I/O only. It has a built-in pull-up resistor and is completely compatible with TTL circuits.</p>
<h3>Port 2</h3>
<p>P2 is similar to P0 when the external memory is used. Pins of this port occupy addresses intended for the external memory chip. This port can be used for higher address byte with addresses A8-A15. When no memory is added then this port can be used as a general input/output port similar to Port 1.</p>
<h3>Port 3</h3>
<p>In this port, functions are similar to other ports except that the logic 1 must be applied to appropriate bit of the P3 register.</p>
<h2>Pins Current Limitations</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>When pins are configured as an output (i.e. logic 0), then the single port pins can receive a current of 10mA.</p></li>
<li><p>When these pins are configured as inputs (i.e. logic 1), then built-in pull-up resistors provide very weak current, but can activate up to 4 TTL inputs of LS series.</p></li>
<li><p>If all 8 bits of a port are active, then the total current must be limited to 15mA (port P0: 26mA).</p></li>
<li><p>If all ports (32 bits) are active, then the total maximum current must be limited to 71mA.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Microcontrollers - 8051 Interrupts</h1>
<p>Interrupts are the events that temporarily suspend the main program, pass the control to the external sources and execute their task. It then passes the control to the main program where it had left off.</p>
<p>8051 has 5 interrupt signals, i.e. INT0, TFO, INTR1, TF1, RI/TI. Each interrupt can be enabled or disabled by setting bits of the IE register and the whole interrupt system can be disabled by clearing the EA bit of the same register.</p>
<h2>IE (Interrupt Enable) Register</h2>
<p>This register is responsible for enabling and disabling the interrupt. EA register is set to one for enabling interrupts and set to 0 for disabling the interrupts. Its bit sequence and their meanings are shown in the following figure.</p>

<h2>IP (Interrupt Priority) Register </h2>
<p>We can change the priority levels of the interrupts by changing the corresponding bit in the Interrupt Priority (IP) register as shown in the following figure.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A low priority interrupt can only be interrupted by the high priority interrupt, but not interrupted by another low priority interrupt.</p></li>
<li><p>If two interrupts of different priority levels are received simultaneously, the request of higher priority level is served.</p></li>

<p>It includes 5 signals, i.e. RD, WR, CS, and the address lines A<sub>0</sub> &amp; A<sub>1</sub>. In the peripheral I/O mode, the RD and WR signals are connected to IOR and IOW, respectively. In the memorymapped I/O mode, these are connected to MEMR and MEMW.</p>
<p>Address lines A<sub>0</sub> &amp; A<sub>1</sub> of the CPU are connected to lines A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> of the 8253/54, and CS is tied to a decoded address. The control word register and counters are selected according to the signals on lines A<sub>0</sub> &amp; A<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<h3>Control Word Register</h3>
<p>This register is accessed when lines A<sub>0</sub> &amp; A<sub>1</sub> are at logic 1. It is used to write a command word, which specifies the counter to be used, its mode, and either a read or write operation. Following table shows the result for various control inputs.</p>

<h3>Counters</h3>
<p>Each counter consists of a single, 16 bit-down counter, which can be operated in either binary or BCD. Its input and output is configured by the selection of modes stored in the control word register. The programmer can read the contents of any of the three counters without disturbing the actual count in process.</p>
<h1>Intel 8253/54 - Operational Modes</h1>
<p>8253/54 can be operated in 6 different modes. In this chapter, we will discuss these operational modes.</p>
<h2>Mode 0 ─ Interrupt on Terminal Count</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It is used to generate an interrupt to the microprocessor after a certain interval.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially the output is low after the mode is set. The output remains LOW after the count value is loaded into the counter.</p></li>
<li><p>The process of decrementing the counter continues till the terminal count is reached, i.e., the count become zero and the output goes HIGH and will remain high until it reloads a new count.</p></li>
<li><p>The GATE signal is high for normal counting. When GATE goes low, counting is terminated and the current count is latched till the GATE goes high again.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mode 1 – Programmable One Shot</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It can be used as a mono stable multi-vibrator.</p></li>
<li><p>The gate input is used as a trigger input in this mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The output remains high until the count is loaded and a trigger is applied.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mode 2 – Rate Generator</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The output is normally high after initialization.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever the count becomes zero, another low pulse is generated at the output and the counter will be reloaded.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mode 3 – Square Wave Generator</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>This mode is similar to Mode 2 except the output remains low for half of the timer period and high for the other half of the period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mode 4 − Software Triggered Mode</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In this mode, the output will remain high until the timer has counted to zero, at which point the output will pulse low and then go high again.</p></li>
<li><p>The count is latched when the GATE signal goes LOW.</p></li>
<li><p>On the terminal count, the output goes low for one clock cycle then goes HIGH. This low pulse can be used as a strobe.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mode 5 – Hardware Triggered Mode</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>This mode generates a strobe in response to an externally generated signal.</p></li>
<li><p>This mode is similar to mode 4 except that the counting is initiated by a signal at the gate input, which means it is hardware triggered instead of software triggered.</p></li>
<li><p>After it is initialized, the output goes high.</p></li>
<li><p>When the terminal count is reached, the output goes low for one clock cycle.</p></li>
</ul>
