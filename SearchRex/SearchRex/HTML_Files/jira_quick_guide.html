<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/all_issues.jpg" alt="All Issues" />
<h1>JIRA - Issues</h1>
<p>JIRA is a project management tool and uses issues to track all the tasks. An issue helps to track all works that underlie in a project. In real time, every work or task either technical, non-technical, support or any other type of a project in JIRA are logged as an issue.</p>
<p>An issue can be dependent on the organization and requirements &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Story of a project</li>
<li>Task of a story</li>
<li>Sub-task of a story</li>
<li>A defect or bug can be an issue</li>
<li>Helpdesk Ticket can be logged as issue</li>
<li>Leave Request</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screen shot shows the basic page and information of an open issue &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/basic_page.jpg" alt="Basic Page" />
<h1>JIRA - Workflow</h1>
<p>In JIRA, workflow is used to <b>track the lifecycle of an Issue</b>. Workflow is a record of statuses and transitions of an issue during its lifecycle. A status represents the stage of an issue at a particular point. An issue can be in only one status at a given point of time like Opened, To Do, Done, Closed, Assigned, etc.</p>
<p>A transition is a link between two statuses when an issue moves from one status to another. For an issue to move between two statuses, a transition must exist. In a simple way, a transition is some kind of work done on the issue, while status is the impact of work on that issue.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>As of now, an issue is created and opened. When the assignee starts working on the issue, the issue moves to the <b>In Progress status</b>. Here, the transition is starting the work, while the status of the issue is now progressive.</p>
<p>JIRA workflow has the following stages to track as soon as an issue is created &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Open Issue</b> &minus; After creation, the issue is open and can be assigned to the assignee to start working on it.</p></li>
<li><p><b>In Progress Issue</b> &minus; The assignee has actively started to work on the issue.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Resolved Issue</b> &minus; All sub-tasks and works of that Issue are completed. Now, the issue is waiting to be verified by the reporter. If verification is successful, it will be closed or re-opened, if any further changes are required.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reopened Issue</b> &minus; This issue was resolved previously, but the resolution was either incorrect or missed a few things or some modifications are required. From Reopened stage, issues are marked either as assigned or resolved.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Close Issue</b> &minus; The issue is considered as finished, resolution is correct as of now. Closed issues can be re-opened later based on the requirement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>JIRA Workflow can be referred as a <b>Defect Lifecycle</b>. It follows the same concepts; the only difference is that it is generic for all issues rather than limited to Defects only.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a standard workflow &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/standard_workflow.jpg" alt="Standard Workflow" />
<p>A transition is a one-way link, if an issue moves back and forth between two statuses; two transitions should be created.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus; There are two-way transitions between closed and re-opened statuses. A closed issue can be reopened if any modifications are required at any time until the project completes, while a re-opened issue can be closed directly if additional work is taken care in another issue and no specific work has been done on the re-opened issue.</p>
<h1>JIRA - Installation</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn how to install JIRA on your system.</p>
<h2>Important Points to Note</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>JIRA is a web application that provides a private website to an individual or a set of requested users belonging to the same company/project.</p></li>
<li><p>JIRA can be run as a Windows Service at the server side.</p></li>
<li><p>JIRA is a pure Java based application and supports all OS platforms like Windows, Linux of different versions or MAC, etc., those satisfy JDK/JRE requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>JIRA supports all famous browsers like Chrome, IE, Mozilla and Safari.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports Mobile browsers as well in mobile views.</p></li>

<h2>Issue Type Schemes</h2>
<p>An issue type scheme determines which issue types will be available to a project or set of projects. It also manages specifying the order in which the issue types will present in the user interface of JIRA, while creating an Issue. An issue type scheme generates as soon as the project is added in the JIRA.</p> 
<p>Here, one scheme is by default named as the Default Issue Type Scheme and others are project schemes. The default issue type scheme is the list of global issue types. All newly created issue types will automatically be added to this scheme. The following screenshot shows Issue type schemes of different projects.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/issue_type_schemes.jpg" alt="Isuue Type Schemes" />

<h1>JIRA - Clone an Issue</h1>
<p>Cloning means to copy. To clone an issue means to create a duplicate issue within the same project. A cloned issue can be treated as a new issue and edited like other issues.</p>
<p>We should consider the following points while cloning an issue.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A cloned issue is completely a separate issue from the original issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Any action or operation taken on the original issue does not have any impact on the clone issue and vice-versa.</p></li>
<li><p>The only connection between the original and clone is the link that is created.</p></li>
<li><p>Information that is carried from the original issue to clone issue is as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Summary</p></li>
<li><p>Description</p></li>

<h1>JIRA - Create a Subtask</h1>
<p>An issue can be completed by performing many tasks with different persons like Dev, QA, UAT, Business, Support, etc. To track the progress in each department, sub-tasks are created in an issue and assigned to the concern person. Once all the sub-tasks are resolved, the issue can be marked as completed.</p>
<h2>Points to Note for Creating a Subtask</h2>
<p>The following points are to be considered when creating a subtask.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>All subtasks are an essential part of their parent issue.</li>
<li>All subtasks are visible on the main screen of the parent issue.</li>
<li>Subtasks always belong to the same project as their parent issue.</li>
<li>Subtask has all fields that are present in the standard issue.</li>
<li>Subtasks cannot have a subtask of their own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps to Follow for Creating a Subtask</h2>
<p>We should consider the following steps when creating a subtask.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Open an issue where subtasks should be created. </li>
<li>Select More &rarr; Create Subtask. Create subtask page will display.</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/successful_conversion.jpg" alt="Successful Conversion" />
<h2>Convert an Issue to a Subtask</h2>
<p>We should consider the following points while converting an issue to a subtask.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>An issue cannot be converted into a subtask if it has its own subtask.</p></li>
<li><p>To convert such an issue into a subtask, we should first convert all the subtasks of issues into a standard issue and after that convert the issue into a subtask.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtasks cannot be moved from one issue to another directly.</p></li>
<li><p>To move a subtask from one issue to another, first convert all sub-tasks into issues and then again, convert issues to subtasks by giving the parent issue name while converting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to covert a subtask to an issue.</p>
<h1>JIRA - Convert Subtask to Issue</h1>

<h1>JIRA - Create Issue using CSV</h1>
<p>A User can create multiple issues at a time using Comma separated file known as CSV. The CSV files are text files those represent tabulated data and separate different sections by commas.</p>
<p>They have two-step process that requires importing the data from a CSV, while a third optional step is also present, which are listed below.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Prepare a CSV file.</li>
<li>Import the CSV file into the system.</li>
<li>Save the configuration for future use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prepare the CSV File</h2>
<p>While creating a CSV file the following points must be considered.</p>
<p>Each CSV file should have a heading row with a summary column. The first row is the heading row and represents the fields of the create issue page. <b>Example</b> &minus; Summary, Assignee, Reporter, Priority, Description, sprint, “Test Suite”, Ashish, Ashish, 1, etc.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Use double quote marks (“) in the CSV file to capture data that appears in multip.le lines. <b>For Example</b> &minus; upon import, JIRA will treat the following CSV as a single record: Summary, Description, Status, "Login issue", "This is on a new line", Open </p></li>
<li><p>While importing issues from a CSV file, the Project Name and Project Key are important columns in CSV. In addition, the name of these fields should match exactly as they are present in JIRA.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Import the CSV File</h2>
<p>To import the CSV file, we should follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Select Issues &rarr; Import Issues from CSV to open the Bulk Create Setup page.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to access the Import issues from the CSV functionality.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/csv_functionality.jpg" alt="CSV functionality" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; On the Setup page, select CSV Source File. Do not check the “Use an existing configuration file” check box, if you do not have a configuration file or if you want to create a new configuration file.</p>
<p>Configuration files specify a mapping between column names in the CSV file's header row and fields in the JIRA application.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the Bulk create setup page, where the user browses and uploads the CSV file.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/csv_source_file.jpg" alt="CSV Source File" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; If the user checks the checkbox of “Use an existing configuration file”, JIRA will ask to specify an Existing Configuration File.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to use an existing configuration file.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/bulk_create_setup.jpg" alt="Bulk Create Setup" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; If the user does not select this option, then at the end of the CSV file import wizard, JIRA will ask to create a configuration file, which can be used for subsequent CSV imports.</p>
<p>Click on the Next button &rarr; the Settings step of the CSV file import wizard will display. Complete the required fields. If the CSV file uses a different separator character other than a comma, specify that character in the CSV Delimiter field. If the separator is a 'Tab', this can be entered using the format '/t'.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to provide settings of csv file &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/settings_of_csv_file.jpg" alt="Settings of CSV File" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Click on the Next button to proceed to the Map field’s step of the CSV file import wizard. Here, the user has to map the column headers of the CSV file to the fields in the selected JIRA project. After selection, tick the check box for Map field value.</p>
<p>A CSV field should map to the JIRA summary field. This ensures the issues created have a summary.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to map CSV fields with JIRA fields &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/map_field_value.jpg" alt="Map Field Value" />
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Click on the Next button, the Map values step of the CSV file import wizard will display. On this step of the import wizard, the user can select which specific CSV field values to map to which specific JIRA field value.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Fields whose Map Field Value check boxes were selected in the previous step will be presented on this page.</p></li>
<li><p>If the CSV field has a username (e.g. Reporter or Assignee) and does not select the Map Field Value check box for this field in the previous step of the CSV file import wizard, then the importer will map imported usernames from the CSV file to (lowercase) JIRA usernames.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to map values.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/how_to_map_values.jpg" alt="How to Map Values" />
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Click on the Validate button, it will validate the imported data and display if any errors or warnings are required, otherwise it will display how many successful imports are possible with the file.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the successful validation of CSV file.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/validation.jpg" alt="Validation" />
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; Now, Click the Begin Import button. The importer will display updates like import is in progress, then a success message when the import is completed.</p>
<p>Following screenshot shows how many issues are created using CSV file &minus;</p>

<h1>JIRA - Search</h1>
<p>JIRA has powerful and very efficient search functionalities. A user can search issues across Projects, Versions and Components using various search types. JIRA allows saving the search criteria to utilize next time as filters; even these filters can be shared by others as well.</p>
<h2>Types of Searching Options</h2>
<p>JIRA has a couple of fundamental ways to search issues. The most important ones are as follows.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Basic Search</li>
<li>Quick Search</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us now understand both of these search types in detail.</p>
<h2>Basic Search</h2>
<p>Basic Search in JIRA is a user-friendly interface that can be used easily to find out the issues. It uses the JQL queries in the backend. To do a basic search in JIRA, the user has to follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Navigate to issues &rarr; Search Issues. The following screenshot shows how to access the Search for Issues feature.</p>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/contains_text.jpg" alt="Contains Text" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; A user can use wildcards or operators in all text based fields to search specific strings. For example &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Single character wildcard - te?t</li>
<li>Multiple characters wildcard – win*</li>
<li>Boolean operators - "atlassian jira" || confluence</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on different search criteria, the following result is displayed. The following screenshot shows the list of searched issues.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/wildcards.jpg" alt="Wildcards" />
<h2>How to Save a Search</h2>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; A Filter will appear on the left side of the Search Page under the Favourite filters and it will have a few options like – Rename, Delete, Copy and Remove from Favourites. The following screenshot shows the saved search criteria and the available actions to perform.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/basic_search.jpg" alt="Basic Search" />
<h2>Quick Search</h2>
<p>The quick search is the fastest way to define search criteria. It is a text box where the user enters the key, text or anything and it starts searching for the exact matches in the current project and provides the result.</p> 
<p>The Quick Search box is available on the top right hand corner of the navigator. The following screenshot shows how to access the Quick Search feature.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/search.jpg" alt="Search" />
<h2>Smart Querying</h2>
<p>The quick search option performs smart searches with minimal typing. It recognizes the following word and gives out several options to the user to choose.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>my</b> &minus; This word searches issues assigned to the logged-in user.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows different smart querying in a quick search.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/quick_search.jpg" alt="Quick Search" />
<p>Some of the most commonly used smart querying options are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>r:me</b> &minus; Finds issues reported by the logged-in user.</p></li>
<li><p><b>r:abc</b> &minus; Finds issues reported by user – abc.</p></li>
<li><p><b>r:none</b> &minus; Finds issues with no reporter.</p></li>
<li><p><b>&lt;project name&gt; or &lt;project key&gt;</b> &minus; Finds issues within the given project name or finds issues having the same project key.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Overdue</b> &minus; Finds issues those are overdue before today.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Created:, updated:, due:</b> &minus; These smart searches finds issues with Created, Updated, or Due Date using the prefixes created:, updated:, or due:, respectively. For the date range, use today, tomorrow, yesterday, a single date range (e.g. '-1w'), or two date ranges (e.g. '-1w,1w'). Date ranges cannot have spaces between them. Valid date/time abbreviations are: 'w' (week), 'd' (day), 'h' (hour), 'm' (minute).</p></li>
<li><p><b>C:</b> &minus; Finds issues with a particular component.</p></li>
<li><p><b>V:</b> &minus; Finds issues with a particular version.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Ff:</b> &minus; Finds issues with a Fixed For version.</p></li>
<li><p><b>*</b> &minus; Wildcard can be utilized with any of the above queries to find issues.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>JIRA - Advanced Search</h1>
<p>Apart from the type of searches explained in the previous chapter, JIRA also has a few advanced search options, which can be performed using the following three ways.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Using Field Reference</li>
<li>Using Keyword Reference</li>
<li>Using Operators Reference</li>
</ul>
<p>These above-mentioned three ways have been explained in detail below.</p>
<p>The user should consider the following points while performing any advanced search.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Advanced search uses structured queries to search for JIRA issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Search results displays in the Issue Navigator.</p></li>
<li><p>Search results can be exported to MS Excel and many other available formats.</p></li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira064/using-filters-720416526.html">Save</a> and Subscribe features are available to advanced searches.</p></li>
<li><p>An advanced search uses the JIRA Query Language known as JQL.</p></li>
<li><p>A simple query in JQL consists of a field, operator, followed by one or more values or functions. For example, the following simple query will find all issues in the "WFT" project &minus;</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Project = "WFT"
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>JQL supports SQL like syntax such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, ISNULL() functions, but JQL is not a Database Query Language.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Field Reference</h2>
<p>A field reference means a word that represents the field name in the JIRA issue including the custom fields. The syntax is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
&lt;field name&gt; &lt;operators like =,&gt;, &lt;&gt; “values” or “functions” 
</pre>
<p>The operator compares the value of the field with value presents at right side such that only true results are retrieved by query.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Go to Issues &rarr; Search for Issues in the navigator bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to navigate the Search section.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/search_section.jpg" alt="Search section" />
<p>If there is an existing search criterion, click on the New Filter button to reset the criteria. The following screenshot shows how to start with a new criteria.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/new_filter.jpg" alt="New Folder" />
<p>Type the query using the Field, Operator and Values like <b>issueKey = “WFT-107”</b>.</p>
<p>There are other fields as well – Affected Version, Assignee, Attachments, Category, Comment, Component, Created, Creator, Description, Due, Environment, etc. As soon as the user starts typing, the auto-complete functionality helps to write in the defined format.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to add Field Name criteria using advanced features.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/field_name_criteria.jpg" alt="Field Name criteria" />
<p><b>Operator selection</b> &minus; The following screenshot shows how to select operators.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/operator_selection.jpg" alt="Operator Selection" />
<p>The next step is to enter the value and then click on the Search symbol. The following screenshot shows how to add values and search.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/add_values_search.jpg" alt="Add Vales Search" />
<p>The following screenshot shows the search result based on criteria set.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/search_result.jpg" alt="Search result" />
<h2>Using Keyword Reference</h2>
<p>Here, we will understand how to use a keyword reference and what its advantages are</p>
<p>A keyword in JQL &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>joins two or more queries together to form a complex JQL query.</li>
<li>alters the logic of one or more queries.</li>
<li>alters the logic of operators.</li>
<li>has an explicit definition in a JQL query.</li>
<li>performs a specific function that defines the results of a JQL query.</li>
</ul>
<p>List of Keywords &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>AND &minus; ex- status = open AND priority = urgent And assignee = Ashish.</li>
<li>OR &minus; ex – duedate &lt; now() or duedate is empty.</li>
<li>NOT &minus; ex – not assignee = Ashish .</li>
<li>EMPTY &minus; ex - affectedVersion is empty / affectedVersion = empty.</li>
<li>NULL &minus; ex – assignee is null.</li>
<li>ORDER BY &minus; ex – duedate = empty order by created, priority desc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to field reference, as soon as the user starts typing, the auto-complete functionality helps to get the correct syntax. The following screenshot shows how to add keywords.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/add_key_words.jpg" alt="Add Key Words" />
<p>Click on the Search symbol and it will provide the search results. The following screenshot shows the result based on a criteria set.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jira/images/search_symbol_result.jpg" alt="Search symbol Result" />
<h2>Using Operators Reference</h2>
<p>Operators are used to compare values of the left side with the right side, such that only true results display as the search result.</p>
<h3>List of Operators</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Equals: = </li>
<li>Not Equals: != </li>
<li>Greater Than: &gt;</li>
<li>Less Than: &lt; </li>
<li>Greater Than Equals: =&gt;</li>
<li>Less than equals: =&lt;</li>
<li>IN</li>
<li>NOT IN</li>
<li>CONTAINS: ~</li>
<li>Does Not contain: ! ~</li>
<li>IS</li>
<li>IS NOT</li>
<li>WAS</li>
<li>WAS IN</li>
<li>WAS NOT IN</li>
<li>WAS NOT</li>
<li>CHANGED</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the Field and the Keyword Reference, these operators can also be used to enhance the search results.</p>
<h1>JIRA - Reports</h1>
<p>JIRA provides different types of reports within a project. It helps to analyze the Progress, Issues, Showstoppers and Timeliness of any Project. It also helps to analyze the resource utilization as well.</p>

<li><p><b>Time since Issues Report</b> &minus; It helps to track how many issues were created, updated, resolved, etc., over a time-period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Forecast &amp; Management</h3>
<p>Following are the list of features of Forecast and Management type of reports.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Time Tracking Report</b> &minus; Shows the original and current time estimates for issues in the current project. It can help to determine whether work is on track for those issues.</p></li>
<li><p><b>User Workload Report</b> &minus; Shows the time estimates for all unresolved issues assigned to a user across projects. It helps to understand how much a user is occupied, whether overburdened or has less work.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Version Workload Report</b> &minus; Displays how much outstanding work is remaining per user and per issue. It helps to understand the remaining work of a version.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these, there are other types of reports that generally have a pie chart in them, which we will discuss in detail in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<h1>JIRA - Workload Pie Chart</h1>
