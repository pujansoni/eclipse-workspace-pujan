<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - Overview</h1>
<p>SAP Simple Logistics is also called <b>SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management</b>. It consists of all the key modules under SAP ERP Business Suite - Material Management, Supply Chain, Demand Planning, Sourcing and Procurement, Contract Management, and Manufacturing.</p>
<p>Following business processes can be managed using SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management with improved performance and efficiency for all these processes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Inventory Management</b> &minus; SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management provides a simplified data model resulting in increased throughput and flexible analytics at the most granular level.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Procurement</b> &minus; With SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, you can achieve increased efficiency in the Procure-To-Pay processes, new Analytical Apps and Spend KPIs, Ariba Network Integration for PO Order and IV.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Material Requirements Planning</b> &minus; You can perform fast MRP run, and a new working model for MRP controllers based on decision support.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Order Management &amp; Billing</b> &minus; Using S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, you can perform end-to-end order-to-cash process and take action for any exceptions, information on the exceptions to resolve the issues, lower TCO due to data model simplification, support for the most recent versions of business features such as FSCM Credit Management, GTS Foreign Trade, SFIN Revenue Accounting, and new analytical capabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>ERP Model vs S/4 HANA Data Model</h2>
<p>To manage large volumes of data, SAP has provided next generation Business Suite S/4 HANA, which uses computing power of HANA to process huge amounts of data at very high speed.</p>
<p>SAP S/4 HANA is not a successor of SAP ERP solution and represents a separate product line. SAP ERP solution is a separate product from SAP. With new S/4 HANA Data Model, you can achieve the following benefits over ERP Data Model &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In new S/4 HANA Data Model, it drops all aggregate fields and history tables (in total 24 tables).</p></li>
<li><p>In the new model, there is no need to perform updates on aggregation tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Open for new stock types.</p></li>
<li><p>High speed evaluations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the recent business development, there has been exponential growth of information - social media, big data, and mobile. In the next 2 years, there will be growth in adaption of business networks. By 2020, there will be 9 billion mobile users worldwide and this will only increase with time.</p>
<h2>SAP S/4 HANA Business Suite ─ Key Features</h2>
<p>Following are some of the key features of SAP S/4 HANA Business Suite &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>SAP S/4 HANA is designed based on new Fiori user experience which provides a role-based integrated user experience.</p></li>
<li><p>S/4 HANA can be connected to different applications in real time to provide realtime data processing and analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>S/4 HANA runs on in-memory HANA database to provide simplifications - no indexes, no aggregates, and no redundancies.</p></li>
<li><p>SAP S/4 HANA provides a choice of deployment - On-Premise, Cloud, and Hybrid.</p></li>
<li><p>S/4 HANA provides new architecture and data models.</p></li>
<li><p>Customers can use the customization even after migration of the system. Migration of SAP Business Suite to S/4 HANA is done via implementation package in the form of SAP Simple Finance and Simple Logistics, and many more.</p></li>
<li><p>With SAP S/4HANA, SAP is providing a new product and a next generation of business applications – simple enterprise software for Big Data and is designed to help you run simple in the digital economy.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/business_suite.jpg" alt="Business Suite" />
<p>In the following image, you can see different sub-modules available with SAP S/4 HANA Business Suite.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/business_suite_modules.jpg" alt="Business Suite Modules" />
<p>SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management has been designed by reintegrating portions of SAP CRM, SRM, and SCM into this solution. SAP S/4HANA Enterprise Management is available on-premise and in the cloud. It depends on different licensing/subscription models. SAP S/4 HANA solution can be a Cloud solution or you can also implement it as On-Premise system like SAP ERP.</p>
<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - Main Components</h1>
<p>In today’s business, it is one of the toughest challenges to meet the inventory requirements as per customer demands. Also, with the development of new technologies, the expectations have increased.</p>
<h2>Inventory Management</h2>
<p>With the use of S/4 HANA, an improvement in Inventory Management is observed with the creation of one document table (MATDOC).</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/inventory_management.jpg" alt="Inventory Management" />
<p>In the above image, you can see a simplified inventory management data model that led to the creation of Material document table MATDOC. Following changes are implemented with this approach &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>No need of saving aggregated tables, on fly aggregation</li>
<li>No joining is required with merging header and item level</li>
<li>Corrected Material Master Data Table</li>
</ul>
<h2>Material Valuation</h2>
<p>In SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, following material valuation methods are supported &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Standard Price</li>
<li>Moving Avg. Price</li>
<li>Actual Costing</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the clear separation of master data from transactional data. S/4HANA data model includes only 4 tables instead of multiple tables. You observe reduction of memory footprint and data footprint.</p>
<p>Reporting is not only based on material ledger tables and that contains data only related to material. No information is provided related to financial dimensions. The new reporting based on S/4 HANA data model includes both financial and material data.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/data_model.jpg" alt="Data Model" />
<h2>Material Requirements Planning Run and Analysis</h2>
<p>Using SAP S/4 HANA, material requirement planning shows an overview of the innovations with performance improvement in MRP run. All the material flow is analyzed in real time and quickly identifies any disruptions in material flow and the impact of these issues in Material Requirement Planning Analysis.</p>
<p>Following benefits can be achieved using the new support model &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Scenario dependent and 10 times faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for in-house production and delivery schedules.</p></li>
<li><p>Classic mode for capacity planning and discontinuation.</p></li>
<li><p>MRP run on any personal device.</p></li>
<li><p>Adoptable and personalization.</p></li>
<li><p>With SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, you can use an exception-based working mode to detect issues earlier and this approach helps to improve customer satisfaction by using the Sales Order Fulfillment cockpit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - Simplification Item</h1>
<p>In SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, you can create a simplification list for better management and estimation. Using the Simplification list, it defines the functional capabilities to the individual transactions.</p>
<p>A Simplification list contains a list of simplification items, which tells about the business and technical impact. Simplification item has a simplification category and provides information about potential impacts for the customer. Based on the Simplification Item custom code, check analysis can be executed.</p>
<p>In SAP S/4 HANA, there is a change in relationship between Bills of Material, Routings, and Production Version. You can combine Bills of Material and routing into one entity and hence it streamlines the revision process. In SAP ERP Business Suite, product master material number field length is 18, which has been increased to 40 characters.</p>
<p>Few of MRP fields have been removed like MRP view fields of item master. In ERP system, the vendor master and the customer master are commonly used; however, SAP S/4 HANA approach is based on SAP Business Partner screening to centrally manage master data for business partners, customers, and vendors. Business Partner provides a single point of entry to create, edit, and display master data for business partners, customers, and vendors.</p>
<h2>Extended Material Number Functionality Activation</h2>
<p>In S/4 HANA system, if you want to use a material number with 40 characters, following feature has to be activated in the system. The following settings are required &minus;</p>
<h3>Activation of the Extended Material Number Functionality</h3>
<p>Navigate to SPRO &rarr; IMG &rarr; Cross Application Components &rarr; General Application Functions &rarr; Field length Extension &rarr; Activate extended fields or use Transaction: <b>FLETS</b></p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/extended_material.jpg" alt="Extended Material" />
<h3>Changing the Material Number Format</h3>
<p>Transaction <b>OMSL</b> allows customer-specific settings regarding the material number field length.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/transaction.jpg" alt="Transaction" />
<p>You can make the settings that needs to be adapted to allow a field length of more than 18 characters or under Material Master Basic Settings.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/change_material_format.jpg" alt="Change Material Format" />
<h3>Key Points About Simplification List</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In SAP S/4 HANA, you can integrate simplification list with custom code check tool and this tool is used to pull a detailed report where custom code doesn’t meet the requirement and scope of S/4 HANA system.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Simplification List, you need to identify the areas for which you have to take actions and to create an overall conversion project plan.</p></li>
<li><p>In the simplification list, you can have a simplification item that contains categories of Information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Simplification Categories</h2>
<p>You can categorize simplification items into the following types &minus;</p>
<h3>SAP HANA In-memory Capabilities</h3>
<p>Simplification items are configured to optimize the use of SAP HANA in-memory capabilities.</p>
<h3>Consolidation of Existing Functionalities</h3>
<p>The functionality which is same in core and optimized solution w.r.t business processes and user perspective remains the same.</p>
<h3>No Functional Equivalent</h3>
<p>SAP S/4 HANA is not a successor of SAP ERP Business suite. The functional equality may not exist for both systems. In SAP S/4 HANA system, following transactions are not available &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>FD01, FD02, FD03, FD05, FD06, FD0</li>
<li>FK01, FK02, FK03, FK05, FK06, FK08</li>
<li>MAP1, MAP2, MAP3</li>

<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - Deployment Types</h1>
<p>SAP S/4 HANA provides various deployment models such as On Premise, Cloud and Hybrid solution. When you deploy S/4 HANA system in the cloud deployment scenario, data replication is performed using the same mechanisms that is used in on-premise installations - SLT. To perform data replication via SLT, SLT portions will have to be available on both the sending (On-premise) and the receiving system (Cloud).</p>
<p>Non-SAP reporting and analytics and additional SAP Simple Finance or partner products need to be connected to the cloud instance or be made available within the cloud installation as required.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/cloud_instance.jpg" alt="Cloud Instance" />
<h2>On-Premise Solution</h2>
<p>In On-premise deployment model, the customer purchases software and hardware; the operations are managed by the customer itself. All the deployment, implementation and maintenance tasks are performed by the customer. Any new software extensions are handled by on-premise support team.</p>
<h2>Cloud Solution</h2>
<p>In this deployment, hardware and software is provided by the cloud solution provider and it is rented to the customer. The cloud service provider is responsible for performing all the updates, extensions, and new implementations.</p>
<h2>Hybrid Solution</h2>
<p>In this deployment scenario, some part of the software is run by the client on-premise server owned by the client, and additional solution is provided by the client provider. You need to perform an integration between on-premise and cloud environment for better service.</p>
<h2>Types of Users in SAP S/4 HANA</h2>
<p>You can have different user types in S/4 HANA system to meet the business requirement. In every company, you have three basic user types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

<li>Global Available-to-Promise (ATP) Check</li>
<li>Transport Planning/Vehicle Scheduling (TP/VS)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demand Planning</h2>
<p>You can use demand planning to plan future demand for specific customers, regions, or sales organizations. Demand planning allows you to forecast future demands and you can create both quantity-based and value-based plans.</p>
<p>You define the planning level using characteristics in the system. All the planning data in demand planning is stored in the form of key figures and it contains a numerical value.</p>
<p>Using time characteristics, you can view, plan, and store the data. Historical data is imported to SAP NetWeaver BW system of SCM with the use of BW extractors.</p>
<p>Various mathematical methods can be used to analyze historical data for demand planning.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Moving average</li>
<li>Constant model</li>
<li>Trend model</li>
<li>Seasonal model</li>
<li>Exponential smoothing</li>
</ul>
<p>In analyzing historical data, you can use various constant models for products with historical data that changes little over time.</p>
<p>In Demand Planning, seasonal models are used for seasonal products. As per requirement, there can be different seasonal products - candles, ice creams, etc.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/demand_planning.jpg" alt="Demand Planning" />
<p>In the above image, you can see the demand planning process flow. The Sales Order details provide the basis for forecasting future demands. With the forecast result, the demand plan is released as Planned Independent Requirement (PIR).</p>

<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - MRP Procedures</h1>
<p>In MRP Procedure, you define MRP type in material master. MRP type determines how the material is planned. MRP is performed based on the present and future sales figures, and planned and exact requirement quantities calculate net requirement calculations.</p>
<p>Following MRP types are available &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Manual reorder point planning</li>
<li>Automatic reorder point planning</li>
<li>Forecast-based planning</li>
<li>Material requirements planning with forecasts for unplanned consumption</li>
<li>Master Production Scheduling (MPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumption-based planning is based on historical consumption values and either uses forecasting or statistical procedures to determine future requirements or just triggers procurement, if the material stock gets low.</p>
<p>For MRP material, normally high value A parts are considered, and the quantity and the desired delivery are the main interest areas. You use Consumption based planning for less critical low value parts B and C.</p>
<p>Manual reorder point planning is the most common type of consumption based planning and involves minimal administrative work to perform this planning. In this planning, the system sets a manually entered reorder point and at the time of planning run it only checks whether the stock has fallen below this reorder point. When the stock is less than this manually entered reorder point, the system triggers procurement to be performed for a fixed lot size.</p>
<p>Following MRP Procedures are supported in consumption based planning &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Reorder Point Planning</li>
<li>Forecast-Based Planning</li>
<li>Time-Phased Planning</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform MRP, you have to navigate to Logistics &rarr; Materials Management &rarr; Material Requirements Planning &rarr; MRP.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/requirement_planning.jpg" alt="Requirement Planning" />
<h2>Master Production Scheduling Procedure</h2>
<p>Master Production Scheduling component under MRP is used to flag the materials which affects the company profits and also takes the critical resources. MPS is executed in a similar manner as Material Requirement Planning.</p>
<p>MPS is useful to reduce the storage cost and to increase the planning stability. To work with MPS component, you require MRP components and also other components which are required in MRP run.</p>
<h2>Single Item, Single Level Planning</h2>
<p>Single Item, Single Level planning involves planning of only one individual material and BOM is not exploded so only the level directly below the material is planned.</p>
<p>To perform single item, single level planning you need to navigate to MRP run and under Planning &rarr; Single Item Single Level Planning.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/single_level_planning.jpg" alt="Single Level Planning" />
<p>This opens the first screen of single item, single level planning as shown in the above screenshot. In the next window, you have to enter the material number, for which you want to carry out single-item planning, and also the plant or planning area, in which you want to plan.</p>
<p>Enter the MRP Control parameters for the planning run.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/mrp_control.jpg" alt="MRP Control" />

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sap_simple_logistics/images/individual_forecast.jpg" alt="Individual Forecast" />
<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - Procurement Types</h1>
<p><b>Procurement Type</b> is used to determine whether a material is procured in-house or it can be procured externally, i.e. a planned order or a purchase order needs to be created. The type of procurement completely depends on the material type.</p>
<p>When the procurement type supports both in-house production and external procurement, material requirement planning starts with in-house production.</p>
<p>As per the procurement type, the master data settings and MRP parameters, the receipts (usually planned orders or purchase requisitions) are scheduled. Restrictions due to overloads are left out of consideration, the procurement type defines the type of procurement elements. Depending on the procurement, scheduling is applied.</p>
<p>Special Procurement Type is used to define how procurement has to be carried out. In consumption based planning, special procurement type stock transfer from plant to plant at the plant level can be defined.</p>
<p>Material Requirement Planning is normally performed at the plant level. You can also exclude storage location stock from the plant’s MRP run. With the use of storage location MRP, you can define the following special procurement types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Production in an alternative plant</li>
<li>Stock transfer from an alternative plant</li>
<li>External procurement</li>
<li>Consignment</li>

<h1>SAP Simple Logistics - Manufacturing</h1>
<p>In SAP S/4 HANA, SAP offers various functions for discrete manufacturing and batchoriented process manufacturing. This includes the components of Production Planning and Control such as process management.</p>
<p>You can use different production scenarios in S/4 HANA system.</p>
<h2>Discrete and Process Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Based on manufacturing conditions, product complexity, requirement and various other criteria, an organization can use various manufacturing types.</p>
<p>Discrete Manufacturing is order based using Production Order. Typical industry sectors where discrete manufacturing is used are mechanical engineering, automotive component suppliers, electronics and aerospace and consumer goods industry. In Discrete manufacturing, raw materials used to create these products are the same from the first job to the next. It is used in Production Planning where specialized products are manufactured.</p>
<p>Process Manufacturing is order based using the Process Order. This is suitable for chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, food manufacturers, and semiconductor industry. This includes integrated planning of production, waste disposal, transportation of material in the same plant.</p>
<h2>Repetitive Manufacturing</h2>
<p>This is based on different production scenario, which is quantity and period based manufacturing process and not order based. This is typically used in manufacturing engineering, automotive manufacturing, electronic and consumer goods industry, other industry types.</p>
<p>In a manufacturing process, a production order is created. Following are the key steps involved in production order processing &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Status management</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduling</p></li>
<li><p>Calculation of capacity requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Costing</p></li>
<li><p>Availability checks - material, PRT, and capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Printing of order papers</p></li>
<li><p>Material staging by using reservations</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmation of quantities, activities, and time events (variable confirmation procedures)</p></li>
<li><p>Goods receipt</p></li>
<li><p>Period-end closing - process cost allocation, overhead rate, Work In Process (WIP) determination, variance calculation, and order settlement</p></li>
<li><p>Archiving and retrieval</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The releasing of an order is a key milestone in processing of production order. With the release of an order, other activities are carried out such as printing order documents, withdrawing materials, etc.</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the status of production orders is managed and the corresponding status is set when an order is released. With the release of an order, an availability check is performed. It is possible to release a single order, all orders, or multiple orders simultaneously.</p>
<p>In SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, it provides you with a new user experience using apps like Material Coverage, Monitor Production Orders.</p>
