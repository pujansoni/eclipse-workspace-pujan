System Landscape Information We have covered some part of System Landscape information under Solution Manager Infrastructure. SAP Solution Manager applications- Technical monitoring, system maintenance captures all information regarding upgrades with Maintenance planner, alerting policy from system landscape. SAP Solman contains the detailed information about technical system landscape. LMDB is a central repository for Solution Manager to capture all the information and it uses the same CIM model that is used by System Landscape directory. Landscape information contains two parts- SAP software catalog CR content and information sent from SLD. LMDB connection to SLD LMDB gets all the information from the System Landscape Directory where all the systems register itself. Most of the technical systems contain data suppliers that provides direct information to SLD for registration. The LMDB receives SLD changes automatically when a change occurs, using polling by LMDB, or active change notifications by the SLD. SLD contains data from managed system and their data suppliers, which automatically pass all the information in SLD. The transaction code used for ABAP system is RZ70. SLD Synchronization is the most common way to transfer Landscape information to LMDB. When Solution Manager is initially set up, it transfers complete Landscape from SLD to LMDB in Solution Manager. This also includes the information from Software catalog. Once initial full synchronization is done, an incremental synchronization is triggered every 10 minutes. System Landscape Directory This directory contains the information about landscape and software component versions. A SAP system can be configured to register under SLD. System Landscape Directory manages information about all installable and installed elements of your system landscape. You can find the following links in a web page ? Landscape ?
