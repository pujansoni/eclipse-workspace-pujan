The key features of SAP SCM are ? It helps the organization to manage their supply chain process in a dynamic environment. SAP SCM process helps suppliers, customers, manufacturers, business partners and retailers connect with each other to manage supply chain process effectively and efficiently. It helps organizations to accelerate and optimize end-to-end procure-to-pay process. SCM products from SAP allows an organization to integrate their processes and enforce contract compliance for supply-side and supplier-side requirements throughout using supply chain processes in distributed environment. SAP SCM is a complete software to cover the key processes- Supply Chain networking, supply chain planning and coordination, and supply chain execution. It includes different planning applications related to Advanced Planning and Optimization APO, and for the integration with other SAP execution applications. The primary applications are SAP General Areas, SAP Supply Network Collaboration SNC, SAP Extended Warehouse Management EWM, Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO), Forecasting and Replenishment FRE and SAP Transportation Management TM. In the image shown below, you can see SAP Supply Chain Management and its integration with other R/3 modules to manage supply chain process. SAP SCM - Components SAP Supply Chain Management allows organizations to perform effective planning and execution of logistics within supply network and to perform workflow management. You can see the key steps in managing Supply network in an organization. Each step consists of defined set of activities and hence helping customers, suppliers, and retailers connect with each other to provide an effective supply-chain-management solution. SAP SCM consists of the following components ? SC Collaboration ? This is used to help in making collaborative forecasts and agreements. SC Planning ? This is used to generate the operational plans as per current and relevant data in the system. SC coordination ? This component in Supply Chain is used to coordinate the exchange of data and information between different business units. SC Execution ? This is used to ensure that you execute the supply chain plans in the best possible manner to get the desired result. As per functionality, you can divide SCM/APO into three parts ? Forecasting ? To perform demand planning and forecasting, you can link to Customer Relationship Management CRM to get data related to customer campaigns, etc. Supply Network Planning (SNP) ? To view organization as a network of locations and to check stock projections and stock keeping criteria. Calculations in SNP drive dependent requirements down to supplying locations production and receiving stores. Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling ? This is to check the dependent requirements from locations within the supply network, passed down from SNP. This is linked with Material Requirement Planning (MRP) in Production Planning, which determines the inbound material required to complete a production order. SAP SCM - Benefits Using Supply Chain Management in SAP, an organization can achieve the following benefits in a distributed environment ? Reduce accounts receivable collections with better visibility into the AR process, aging, and extension of credit and consequently, help to reduce the day’s sales outstanding. Effectively manage forecasting and handling sudden changes in demand and supply process. Effectively use Net Fixed assets NFA like plants and equipment. To meet customer demands, you can smartly plan and manage Supply Chain Management process in an organization. Proper inventory optimization, order fulfillment, and shipping of the goods. Distribution of the key information to all the stakeholders spread across the network. Improve communication and collaboration between different business lines to manage demand and supply process in an organization. Improve production efficiency and reduction in production quality issues and hence reduce cost of goods sold. To reduce transportation duties and taxes, and increase rebates and incentives. It also helps to reduce transportation errors. SAP SCM - Demand Management Demand management is used to forecast, manage, and plan the demands of goods and has defined set of processes and capabilities to produce goods. The key features of Demand Management are ? This component is used to improve the demand planning by utilizing promotions. Based on historical sales data, you can handle demand for every store, product from different customers and hence you can see customer responses as per change in pricing policies, and profit for a particular product in the organization. You use demand models to predict consumers’ reaction with price change. As per organization goals like- increase profit, revenue, etc. you can define selling strategies for the products. In SAP PP system, demand management is performed by Planned Independent requirement PIR. Planned Independent Requirement provides input for production planning. A PIR contains one planned quantity of product and one date for material or a Planned quantity is split over a span of time period. To set your PIR version active use value 00 to specify requirement would be considered in material requirement planning. To maintain number of versions of planned independent requirement, you can set some numbers to active and others to inactive. PIRs define the planning strategy in material master, which determines planning methods- make to order and make to stock. In Make-to-Stock environment, PIRs are used where stock is built based on the forecast and not on sales order. Planning Strategies Planning strategies are divided into two categories ? Make to Stock Planning strategy (MTS) This is planning strategy where stock is produced without sales order. It is used to meet the customer demands in future. When you use Planning strategy 10, only PIR quantity is considered for MRP run and sales order are completely ignored. In this PIR requirement type LSF is reduced when you deliver stock to customer. When you use Planning strategy 40, for MRP run maximum of 2 PIR and Sales order can be considered and PIR is reduced when enter the Sales order. PIR requirement type is VSF in this case. Make to Order Planning strategy (MTO) In this planning strategy, finished products are not produced until you receive sales order from a customer. For MRP run, you only consider Sales order. In MTO strategy, you only produce sales order stock and products are delivered as per sales orders from specific customer. You use Planning strategy 20 for make to order MTO process and planning strategy 25 is used to produce product variants when there is request for variant products from customer. SAP SCM - Creating PIR In this chapter, we will learn how to create, change, or delete PIRs. To create PIR, follow the given steps ? Step 1 ? Use T-code MD61 or go to Logistics ? Production ?

SAP SCM - Material Requirement Planning MRP run or planning run is an engine, which is used to fill demand and supply gap. Issues & Receipts are called MRP Elements. Issues include PIRs, Dependent Requirements, Order Reservations, Sales Orders, Issuing Stock Transfer Orders, etc. and Receipts include Production Orders, Purchase Requisitions, Purchase Orders, Open Production Orders, Receiving Stock Transfer Order, Schedule lines, etc. MRP Parameters MRP parameters are required to run material requirement planning to meet Planned Independent Requirement PIR and to use routing information. Different MRP parameters can be used ? Processing Key NetChange ? In this run system consider those material which has undergone some changes from the previous MRP run. NetChange in Planning Horizon ? This run considers the requirement in predefined planning horizon and not like net change which check the future requirements. In this run, system consider only those material which has undergone some changes from their last MRP run. Regenerative Planning ? In this run, system consider all the material irrespective of changes and it is time consuming and not common in Production planning. Scheduling Basic Scheduling ? It only calculates basic dates for orders in MRP run and in house production time for material master in use. Lead-time Scheduling ? In this MRP, production dates are defined by lead-time scheduling for planned orders. Running MRP for all Products To run MRP for all products ? Step 1 ? Use T-code: MD01 or go to Logistics ?

SAP SCM - Integration To transfer master and transaction data from ERP system to SCM system, you need to define an integration model. An integration model specify which data objects from ERP system is to be transferred from total objects available. You can create the integration model for master data like- BOM, routing, campaign management details, uplift quantity. Integration is also required to move data from SAP SCM system to ERM modules- like CRM to move sales quantity data, etc. You can perform integration between SAP Customer Relationship Management and SAP Supply Chain Management SAP SCM to perform the following activities ? If you want to move the baseline sales quantity from SAP SCM to SAP CRM. To transfer the uplift quantity from CRM module to Supply Chain Management. You can use trade promotions or campaigns to include in Demand Planning and Supply Network Planning SNP in SAP SCM. In SAP SCM, to create an integration model, you need to choose the object like- Material masters on create Integration Model selection screen. Then you have to mention the selection criteria that further restrict the object types you have already selected. When you select object Material Masters, select MRP controller to define the filter objects. Filter objects are used to select which data objects are transferred to a specified SCM system. SAP SCM - Integration Models To transfer master and transaction data from ERP system to SCM system, you need to define an integration model. When you create an integration model, system automatically generates a new version of this model. You can distinguish between versions of an integration model using their date and time of creation, and by filter objects that they contain. You can create as many versions of an integration model as you want however only one version is active at a time. Step 1 ? To generate a new version you can use Transaction code: CFM1 and save the variant of the model. It is also possible to create run time variant of an active integration model. Step 2 ? In the next window, you have to enter the following details ? Logical System APO Application Material Dependent Objects Step 3 ?

There are various planning parameters for each resource type. When you transfer work centers from ERP system, following resource types are already created ? Single-Activity and Multi activity Resource ? In Single activity resource, one activity can be carried out at a time. In multi activity resource, several activities can be carried out at one time. Single-Mixed and Multi mixed Resources ? In SAP SCM, you can use mixed resources to perform Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling, both the activities. Now single mixed resources means that a single activity resources in Production planning and in Detailed Scheduling and multi-mixed resources allow multi activity resources. Line Resource ? It defines working time and rates of line. A line resource is created in APO for each line you create in DI system. In SAP APO system, the following resource types can be manually created ? Vehicle Resource Bucket Resource Transportation Resource Create and Change Resources You can transfer the work centers that you have created in ERP system to SAP APO system using core interface. The system creates a separate resource for each capacity type of the work center while transferring to SAP SCM/APO system. Note ? There are a few resource types in ERP system, which cannot be created automatically and you have to create and change these resource type manually as mentioned above. When you make changes to resource types, they are recorded in planning log. To view the change logs for resource type, check this in SAP ERP system under easy access menu. Navigate to Advanced Planning and Optimization ? Reporting ? Logs ? Display Logs. SAP SCM - Production Data Structures Production Data Structure is known as the structure of master data that can be used in planning process. In SAP APO, a structure is created from production version, or from BOM or a production version in SAP DIMP. You can differentiate Production data structure as per the following ? PDS generated from SAP R/3 system In SAP ERP system, PDS generated from production version or from BOM, which has the details about production cycle and the component assignment for the production of a product. You can also use PDS in Advanced Planning and Optimization as a source of supply for inhouse production. PDS are generated when you transfer the master data using Core Interface in APO system from SAP RP system. In SAP system, Production data structures generated from SAP R/3 master data contains the following data. Bill of material Master recipe Routing Note ? In SAP APO, you cannot change the data in PDs and can only display the data.

SAP SCM - Extended Warehouse SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) is used to efficiently manage inventory in Warehouse and supporting processing of goods movement. It allows company to control their Warehouse inbound and outbound processes and movement of goods in Warehouse. The main process in a Warehouse is incoming and outgoing materials, goods receipt and goods issue, fulfil customer orders, and distribution of goods. When a company does not store any goods, then there is no need of Warehouse management to manage goods. Inbound process involves storage of goods in warehouse and their location. Outbound process involves picking up the goods. Whenever a material is stored in a warehouse, it is stored in storage bin and you can find its current location. Applications of SAP EWM SAP Extended Warehouse Management system ? Controls all goods movement. Provides you the tools to monitor warehouse activities. Manage additional functions in Warehouse like serial number, batch number, vendor management inventory, resource optimization and value added services. Allows you to not only monitor the quantity of goods in Warehouse but manage other critical functions and delivery of goods efficiently. Difference between SAP Warehouse Management and Inventory Management SAP Warehouse management is opposite to Inventory management. Inventory management tells the count of goods in storage location and physical location is unknown. Warehouse management deals with goods movement and monitors the physical location of goods recorded with specific documents. Communication Method SAP ERP and EWM are closely integrated with each other for transfer of transaction and master data. There are two different ways of communication. Core Interface (CIF) Core interface is one of the common method for communication between SAP SCM system and SAP Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO). Master data, maintained in ERP system like customer, material and vendor, which are available in ERP system are transferred to EWM system, use Core Interface CIF communication. For transaction data (inbound/outbound delivery docs), a separate integration model is used for communication. This model uses iDocs or queued remote function call RFC.
