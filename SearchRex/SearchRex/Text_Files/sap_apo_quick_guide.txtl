It provides different business processes related to Demand Planning, Supply Network Planning (SNP), Production Planning/Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS), Transport Management and Global Available-to-Promise. APO is tightly integrated with ECC system using a core interface (CIF) and provides full reporting functionalities on top of data marts and InfoCubes. With the recent release of Supply Chain Management (SCM) 5.0, a new set of functionality has been added - Service Parts Planning - to perform spare part management under Supply Chain. SAP APO provides complete integrated functions to manage supply chain processes and supports various features. The use of Supplier Network Collaboration (SNC) (also known as Inventory Collation Hub (ICH)) to provide collaboration between the suppliers and the customers. Using APO, you can achieve coordination between different partners at all stages of the supply chain process. It starts from receiving an order, monitoring the stock, and shipping of the product. You can constantly perform optimization and evaluation of Supply Chain process and monitor process efficiency. APO also provides BI component to support Reporting functions and data marts. Advanced Planning and Optimization consists of following application functions ? Demand Planning Supply Network Planning Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS) Supply Chain Collaboration Global Availability Transport Management Supply Chain Collaboration/Inventory Collation Hub SAP APO is installed as part of SAP Supply Chain Management server installation or it is also available as an add-on tool to SAP ERP package.

When you select the component, you can also navigate to the Details tab at the top to check the details of the component. SAP APO - Architecture SAP APO architecture consists of multiple components - Database, BI environment contains InfoCubes and Live Cache. InfoCubes are part of BI data mart and live cache is the main area where you keep all the data related to planning and scheduling. You can perform complex calculations in live cache and this improves the performance during calculations and reporting. In a normal deployment scenario of APO, there is only one cache per installation. Although there is a single cache, the data can be loaded in three different ways as per the application type. Time Series ? Suitable for Demand Planning and Supply Network Planning As an Order with a category ? Suitable for SNP, Production Planning/Detailed Scheduling, and Transport Planning and Vehicle Scheduling ATP time series ? Available-to-Promise SAP BI functionality is primarily used by Demand Planning (DP), and depends on InfoCube which contains historical data. Processing of data is done in Time Series live cache and Supply Network Planning. PP/DS uses order live cache and SNP uses data for Time Series live cache. Available-to-Promise relies on data in ATP Time Series Live Cache. In SAP APO and ERP integration, most of the transactional data - Planned orders, purchase requirements - are created in APO, while data related to execution - Sales Order and Purchase Orders - are maintained in SAP ERP. For the integration of transactional data and history, a plug is provided by SAP. Plug-in contains a Core Interface (CIF) and also the interface to SAP BI structure. SAP BI system gets data from Logistics Information System (LIS) in SAP ERP, which stores all the transactional data. Data is stored in InfoCubes with the use of periodic jobs scheduled as per the requirement of data load. CIF provides an event-based trigger approach where data is loaded as and when required. For each event triggered, entries are created in Live Cache of SAP APO system. SAP APO - Supply Chain Monitoring Supply Chain Monitoring (SCM) is an effective tool to make informed decisions for the suppliers and the buyers. The key holders in supply chain process takes decisions based on Supply Chain Monitoring. Supply Chain consists of two tools ? Stock Requirement List MD04 Logistics Information System (LIS) Transaction MD04/Stock Requirement List In supply chain monitoring, all alerts raised in the system should be executed in a symmetrical way. When there are no alerts pending in the supply chain, it results in a healthy system. Enter Material and Plant in the above screenshot and click the tick mark on top of the page. BOM for material was exploded. Enter Purchase requisition. Following activities can be monitored using Transaction MD04 ? Review master data alerts Orders can be placed in lead time Shortages Overages Logistics Information System (LIS) SAP Supply Chain provides various standard reports that can be used to monitor the efficiency of the entire supply chain process. Logistics Information System (LIS) is used to mine the data for the following standard reports ? Vendor Performance Sales Performance Maintenance Cost Rejection Rates Manufacturing Lead Time Using LIS, you can not only evaluate actual data but you can also use it to prepare planning data. Supply Chain Monitoring involves the following functions ? Alert Monitor Alert monitor is used to check if your application is running fine. In an Alert monitor, you can view all the alerts and navigate directly to the application. Alert monitor can also be used with SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM), and Forecasting and Replenishment.

The output of demand planning process is the demand plan which considers all the factors that affects the demand. The demand planning process defines the activity in Demand Planning cycle. As the demand planning process takes place in the form of a cycle, certain activities can be repeated. Demand Planning Implementation The successful setup of the demand planning process includes setting up the planning area. You need to identify the key figures to be used for demand planning. Actual data for demand planning and historical planning data is stored in InfoCube and the current planning data is stored in live cache time series objects. In demand planning, you require a key figure for each department and business partner to create the forecast. For each key figure, you have to decide whether you will also need key figures for corrected history, corrected forecast, promotions, ex-post forecast, and/or ex-post MLR forecast. If key figures do not exist in the system, you can create them. Key Figures in Demand Planning In demand planning, it contains data represented as a numerical value. It can be a quantity or a monetary value. There are three type of key figures commonly used under demand planning ? Quantity (To represent physical quantities) Amount (To represent amount of money) Number (To represent numerical values) To create key figures, navigate to SAP Easy Access ? Demand Planning ? Environment ? Data Warehousing Workbench. This will open the Administrative workbench. Go to Edit ? Objects ? InfoObjects. To create Key Figure, select type as Key figure. Enter InfoObject and click Create button. When creating a key figure for values, you have to select Amount and choose the data type "CURR". Enter the unit/currency "0STAT_CURR or 0Currency. For quantities, select "Quantity," choose the data type "QUAN", and enter the unit "0BASE_UOM or 0Unit.". You can also create characteristics, define characteristics to be used at the planning level, or only for selection. In the Administrative workbench, if APO standard characteristics already exists in the system - "AMATNR" for product and "9ALOCNO" for location. You can also create new characteristics by navigating to Edit ? Objects ? Edit InfoObjects in Administrative workbench. You can create the characteristics you want to use as planning levels and the characteristics that will be used for selection and navigation. Forecast Model Under Demand Planning Forecast model has forecast profiles on which forecast calculations are based. You need to define the correct product for forecasting and the model to be used. You determine the best model in interactive planning either manually or automatically. To create a master forecast profile, navigate to SAP Easy Access ? Advanced Planning and Optimization ? Demand Planning ? Environment ? Maintain Forecast Profile. In Maintenance Forecast profile window, enter the details about the master forecast profile. Create a univariate profile, a multiple linear regression profile, and a composite profile. As per the requirement, choose Univariate Forecast, Multiple Linear Regression and Composite Forecast. Enter the forecast profile created in the previous step. Save the master forecast profile. Note ? You can also store multiple planning scenarios for one product by using different versions. Example You can have three versions in a planning area containing three alternative demand forecasts for one product: one is created using a univariate profile, another is created using an MLR profile, and a third is created using a composite profile. SAP APO - Data Mart, Infocubes & Dp In SAP Advanced Planning and Optimization, each data mart contains InfoCubes which stores actual data and older planning data. In data warehouse such as SAP BW, data mart contains a subset of data from data warehouse. An administrative workbench is used to set up the data mart and to load the data in InfoCubes from a source system. APO Workbench can also be used to load the data into BW system from APO.

When you create planning bucket profiles, it can be used for future planning and past horizon by making an entry in the planning book. Master Data for Supply Network Planning You need to create a master data for planning method used in Supply Network Planning. In Supply Network Planning, you have a general master data. Also you have to identify the planning method to generate the master data. Master Data to Run the Optimizer You should maintain all the master data before you run the optimizer in Supply Network Planning. Like when you want to use Local time, you should set this indicator. Following Master data should be created to run the optimizer ? Location Specific ? It includes the type of location, storage resource, handling resource, calendar and time zone, etc. Product Specific ? It includes the master data related to attributes (weight of product, volume and unit, etc.) unit of measures, procurement related (procurement type, procurement costs, planned delivery time, etc.), SNP related master data and other product specific fields. Resource Specific ? You have the master data specific to resource type - Bucket resources, single mixed resources, multi-mixed resources, etc. Once a resource master data is created, you have to assign resources to the location master data. Supply Network Planning Run Different planning methods are available to run Supply Network Planning. These run can be performed using an application or also in the background. Common SNP planning run includes ? Optimization-Based Planning This planning method is cost effective, which considers all the factors to find the most cost-effective plan. The optimizer considers the following points keeping the cost as a base factor ? Which products are to be produced and the quantity of product transported, stored, and procured. Resources to be used and Production data structures to be used for production. Production location, storage and delivery, and source and destination locations. Heuristic-Based Planning In this planning method, we group all the demands for a product at a location into one demand for the bucket. The planning horizon and key figures on the basis of which heuristic is done, based on the planning book. Supply and Demand Propagation In Supply Network Planning, you use supply and demand propagation to implement continuous changes because of constraints and to find a feasible solution to fulfill the demands.

SAP APO - PP/DS In SAP APO, Production Planning/Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS) is used to generate procurement proposals to meet the production requirements. This component is also used for defining resource plan and order details. You can also plan for critical products to reduce the lead time and to improve time delivery performance. PP/DS can be used to create executable plans and to achieve the following ? Improve the on-time delivery performance for critical products Reduce lead times Improve coordination between resources and better procurement process Reduce the stock cost PP/DS is integrated with other SAP APO components. For example, with demand planning to create a demand plan and to move PIR to PP/DS to create procurement proposals. Transaction and master data from the OLAP system is moved to APO and after order processing planning, results are moved to APO system. Integration of PP/DS with SAP APO applications Let us now discuss integration of PP/DS with SAP APO applications. Integration with Demand Planning Demand planning is used to meet the market demand for critical products after considering different factors and the result of demand planning is a demand plan. Demand plan is moved to PP/DS to raise procurement proposals for both external system and internal procurement process. Using Demand Plan, demand planning is executed for customers and planned independent requirement results are transferred from DP to PP/DS to cover PIR by creating procurement proposals. Following is the Process Flow ? Step 1 ? First step is to start with the release of demand plan to Supply Network Planning. Demand plan can be released as mass processing or online. Step 2 ? Consider the release period same on PP/DS horizon and Supply Network Planning horizon. Step 3 ? Copy requirements to target planning version, resulting in a demand plan to Supply Network Planning, which in turn triggers an event in PP/DS for products. Step 4 ? Action takes place as per Planning Procedure for mentioned products. Step 5 ? Execution of PP/DS Planning. Integration with SNP Supply Network Planning (SNP) ensures that product quantities are available at the right time, right place without overloading of resources in production and transportation process. SNP defines the quantities in which products should be procured, produced, or transported. PP/DS defines lot sizes of products to be procured, and sequences of planning order. Both the methods are integrated and planning is performed for different task distribution. Supply Network Planning and PP/DS Planning Tasks SNP and PP/DS are defined for different phases - SNP planning is used for medium-term objectives and short-term planning is for PP/DS. The horizon for SNP planning and PP/DS planning are same and the planning area doesn't overlap. When the same planning version is used for SNP and PP/DS, it is also possible to convert SNP orders into PP/DS orders. PP/DS Alert Monitoring You can monitor alerts raised in PP/DS planning using the Alert monitor. You need to define an alert profile relevant for to your planning. Different alert types are created in PP/DS. Alerts Related to Relationship between Orders or Operations Dynamic pegging with date/time alerts Fixed pegging alerts Quantity alerts for pegging Shelf life This option is checked in the product master. Navigate to SAP Easy Access ? Advanced Planning and Optimization ? Master Data ? Product. The system compares the shelf life planning with the actual shelf life of receipt during planning.

PFCG Central User Administration (CUA) You can use CUA to maintain the users for multiple ABAP-based systems. You can also synch it with your directory servers. Using this tool, you can manage all the user master record centrally from one client of the system. Transaction Code ? SCUA and create distribution model. User Management Engine (UME) You can use UME roles to control the user authorization in the system. An administrator can use actions, which represent the smallest entity of UME role that a user can use to build access rights. You can open UME administration console using SAP NetWeaver Administrator option. SAP APO - Service Part Planning Service Part Planning (SPP) function deals with service parts starting from raising a demand for the part to the delivery of the product. SPP is done using bill of distribution, which contains the location. During SPP, you consider all the characteristics of the product  the location where this product is most required, sales behavior of the product, and slow or fast moving product, etc. There are different general functions in the Supply Chain, which is relevant for SPP ? Procurement Lead Times It is defined as the time required to transport products from one location to other. Worklists Worklist contains all the queries for which an action has to be taken. The queries are related to planning and analysis results and can also be used by a planner to get some information related to SPP. Contract Packager Each Contract Packager contains locations where goods are repacked. Each location is part of bills of distribution. Main Supplier When you have multiple suppliers assigned to a location, the system identifies one supplier as the mail supplier using SPP analysis and reporting function. Triggers Triggers are generated at certain places as a result of the events created. For example, when master data related to SPP is changed, it can result a trigger. Planning Service Manager PSM is used to run the planning profile in the background. To schedule the planning services in PSM, navigate to SCM Basis ? Planning Service Manager ? Current Settings ? Define Selection. Rounding Rounding function is used to round the quantities to pack sizes. You can define one or more packaging specifications under SAP Easy Access. Navigate to SAP Easy Access ? Advanced Planning and Optimization ? Service Parts Planning ? Environment ? Packaging Specifications ? Maintain Packaging Specification. In Packaging Specification overview window, you can create, edit, and/or delete the existing packaging specifications. Delivery and Shipment All the deliveries and shipments for which goods issue are posted in R/3 system, they remain available in SAP APO. Shipments that are not planned in Transport Planning/Vehicle Scheduling, are automatically removed from APO system. Shipment which are set to shipment End in R/3, the system considers these as not relevant and they are not displayed in search results. To delete shipments and delivery in SAP APO system, you can perform it as a background job. To delete these, navigate to SAP Easy Access ? Advanced Planning and Optimization ? Transport Planning/Vehicle Scheduling ? Planning ? Delete Deliveries or Delete Shipment. These deletions are performed from LiveCache. You will be prompted if you want to delete deliveries/orders with quantity 0. When you click Yes, logs will be displayed. You can click the Detailed Information button to check the log details. SAP APO - Core Interface SAP APO system is commonly integrated with SAP R/3 or ECC system to get the master data, and planning results are transferred back to SAP ERP system. The integration between SAP APO and ECC system includes ? Technical integration between systems Integration of master and transaction data Technical Integration Between Systems To integrate data between SAP R/3 or ECC system to SAP SCM system, you use a Core Interface (CIF) to enable data exchange between the systems. Core Interface provides different integration and data transfer functions. You can transfer master from SAP ECC system to SCM system. When SAP SCM system involves APO, CIF is used to transfer planning results back to ERP. Different administration tools to manage the data transfer between systems. Support for different source/target systems. To transfer the data between ERP and SCM system, you need to customize CIF settings in both the systems. Customizing CIF depends on the types of source and target system. Customizing CIF Settings in ERP System To perform integration between two systems, you have to customize the settings in both the systems. Customization of settings are target system specific or client system dependent. Following settings can be done in the system ? Define Logical System and Assign the Logical System to a Client Transaction Code ? BD54 Transaction Code ? SCC4 Define Trusted RFC Connection and Assign Destination to Various Applications Transaction Code ? SM59 Transaction Code ? CFC7 Defining the Target System and Queue Type Transaction Code ? CFC1 Define User Parameters Transaction Code ? CFC2 Define Filters and Select Size in CIF Settings Transaction Code ? CFC3 Define the Number Ranges for Parallelization Transaction Code ? CFC8 Integration of Master and Transaction Data You need to transfer the master data and master data changes to SAP APO system from the transaction system. This data is transferred via Core Interface. In SAP APO system, you can check the master data transferred to APO system. Navigate to SAP Easy Access ? Advanced Planning and Optimization ? APO Administration ? Integration ? Monitor ? Application Log ? Display Entries Integration of Transaction Data You can integrate different transactional data to SAP R/3 system - Orders and Stock Transfer Processes. Orders define the technical component, which includes procurement details about the product - when and where the product is required and where the different resources are during this process. The different orders such as production orders, purchase orders are transferred from R/3 system to APO system. In SAP APO system, planned orders are transferred to R/3 system ? Following objects are considered as Order transactions ? Planned order Planned independent requirement Production order Purchase order and purchase requisition Transfer order Scheduling agreement Stock Inspection lot Project order Maintenance order SAP APO - Administration In SAP APO Administration, following are the different options related to administrative activities ? SAP LiveCache Administration Integration Options Monitoring Optimization Consistency Check SAP APO Performance Monitor In Performance Monitor, you can monitor the behavior of planning run in APO system. You can perform detailed analysis of the application in APO - Planning Service Manager, Demand Planning and PP/DS, Supply Network Planning (SNP), Global Available-ToPromise (ATP), etc. Performance Monitor can be called using SAP Easy Access ? Advanced Planning and Optimization ? APO Administration ? APO Performance Monitor. In the next window, you can see the navigation tree where you can select the respective application. You have the list of applications, Demand Planning ? Statistics Mass Processing. When you double-click any of the options, the system collects the data and displays on the screen in the right pane. You can also identify certain customizing settings to improve the performance. Similarly, you can access the data and analyze it related to other applications ? Supply Network Planning ? SNP Heuristic Statistics. SAP APO - Cross Application Functions In SAP APO, you can have different sources where products can be procured. During planning in CTM, SNP, or PP/DS, you need to determine the source of supply for the procurement. Procurement Types In Location Product Master, you determine the procurement type to be used to procure a product. There are different Procurement types ? In-house Production(E) ? When the product is procured internally. External Procurement(F) ? When the product is procured externally. Both In-house Procurement and External Procurement ? In Location Product master, you can also use both the types of procurement. Source Determination in External Procurement In an external procurement system, you define the planning of procured products under Material Management in APO application. Subcontracting is another form of procurement in which the product to be procured is manufactured by the subcontractor. Subcontracting process is planned in PP/DS and Supply Network Planning (SNP). Subcontracting planning can be initiated with two types of orders - First is to raise a Planned order, which results in manufacturing of procured products at the subcontractors location and another one is stock transfer requisition to transfer the products from the subcontractors location to the demand location. Note ? When you implement subcontracting for the first time with PP/DS or SNP, SAP recommends using Production Data Structure (PDS) over PPM to provide better integration of master data.
