Based on the type of data, you can create a chart. You can also change the chart type later. Excel offers the following major chart types ? Column Chart Line Chart Pie Chart Doughnut Chart Bar Chart Area Chart XY (Scatter) Chart Bubble Chart Stock Chart Surface Chart Radar Chart Combo Chart Each of these chart types have sub-types. In this chapter, you will have an overview of the different chart types and get to know the sub-types for each chart type. Column Chart A Column Chart typically displays the categories along the horizontal (category) axis and values along the vertical (value) axis. To create a column chart, arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet. A column chart has the following sub-types ? Clustered Column. Stacked Column. 100% Stacked Column. 3-D Clustered Column. 3-D Stacked Column. 3-D 100% Stacked Column. 3-D Column. Line Chart Line charts can show continuous data over time on an evenly scaled Axis. Therefore, they are ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals, such as months, quarters or years. In a Line chart ? Category data is distributed evenly along the horizontal axis. Value data is distributed evenly along the vertical axis. To create a Line chart, arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet. A Line chart has the following sub-types ? Line Stacked Line 100% Stacked Line Line with Markers Stacked Line with Markers 100% Stacked Line with Markers 3-D Line Pie Chart Pie charts show the size of items in one data series, proportional to the sum of the items. The data points in a pie chart are shown as a percentage of the whole pie. To create a Pie Chart, arrange the data in one column or row on the worksheet. A Pie Chart has the following sub-types ? Pie 3-D Pie Pie of Pie Bar of Pie Doughnut Chart A Doughnut chart shows the relationship of parts to a whole. It is similar to a Pie Chart with the only difference that a Doughnut Chart can contain more than one data series, whereas, a Pie Chart can contain only one data series. A Doughnut Chart contains rings and each ring representing one data series. To create a Doughnut Chart, arrange the data in columns or rows on a worksheet. Bar Chart Bar Charts illustrate comparisons among individual items. In a Bar Chart, the categories are organized along the vertical axis and the values are organized along the horizontal axis. To create a Bar Chart, arrange the data in columns or rows on the Worksheet. A Bar Chart has the following sub-types ? Clustered Bar Stacked Bar 100% Stacked Bar 3-D Clustered Bar 3-D Stacked Bar 3-D 100% Stacked Bar Area Chart Area Charts can be used to plot the change over time and draw attention to the total value across a trend. By showing the sum of the plotted values, an area chart also shows the relationship of parts to a whole. To create an Area Chart, arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet. An Area Chart has the following sub-types ? Area Stacked Area 100% Stacked Area 3-D Area 3-D Stacked Area 3-D 100% Stacked Area XY (Scatter) Chart XY (Scatter) charts are typically used for showing and comparing numeric values, like scientific, statistical, and engineering data. A Scatter chart has two Value Axes ? Horizontal (x) Value Axis Vertical (y) Value Axis It combines x and y values into single data points and displays them in irregular intervals, or clusters. To create a Scatter chart, arrange the data in columns and rows on the worksheet. Place the x values in one row or column, and then enter the corresponding y values in the adjacent rows or columns. Consider using a Scatter chart when ? You want to change the scale of the horizontal axis. You want to make that axis a logarithmic scale. Values for horizontal axis are not evenly spaced. There are many data points on the horizontal axis. You want to adjust the independent axis scales of a scatter chart to reveal more information about data that includes pairs or grouped sets of values. You want to show similarities between large sets of data instead of differences between data points. You want to compare many data points regardless of the time. The more data that you include in a scatter chart, the better the comparisons you can make. A Scatter chart has the following sub-types ? Scatter Scatter with Smooth Lines and Markers Scatter with Smooth Lines Scatter with Straight Lines and Markers Scatter with Straight Lines Bubble Chart A Bubble chart is like a Scatter chart with an additional third column to specify the size of the bubbles it shows to represent the data points in the data series. A Bubble chart has the following sub-types ? Bubble Bubble with 3-D effect Stock Chart As the name implies, Stock charts can show fluctuations in stock prices. However, a Stock chart can also be used to show fluctuations in other data, such as daily rainfall or annual temperatures. To create a Stock chart, arrange the data in columns or rows in a specific order on the worksheet. For example, to create a simple high-low-close Stock chart, arrange your data with High, Low, and Close entered as Column headings, in that order. A Stock chart has the following sub-types ? High-Low-Close Open-High-Low-Close Volume-High-Low-Close Volume-Open-High-Low-Close Surface Chart A Surface chart is useful when you want to find the optimum combinations between two sets of data. As in a topographic map, colors and patterns indicate areas that are in the same range of values. To create a Surface chart ? Ensure that both the categories and the data series are numeric values. Arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet. A Surface chart has the following sub-types ? 3-D Surface Wireframe 3-D Surface Contour Wireframe Contour Radar Chart Radar charts compare the aggregate values of several data series. To create a Radar chart, arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet. A Radar chart has the following sub-types ? Radar Radar with Markers Filled Radar Combo Chart Combo charts combine two or more chart types to make the data easy to understand, especially when the data is widely varied. It is shown with a secondary axis and is even easier to read. To create a Combo chart, arrange the data in columns and rows on the worksheet. A Combo chart has the following sub-types ? Clustered Column – Line Clustered Column – Line on Secondary Axis Stacked Area – Clustered Column Custom Combination Excel Charts - Column Chart Column Charts are useful to visually compare values across a few categories or for showing data changes over a period of time. A Column Chart typically displays the categories along the horizontal (category) axis and the values along the vertical (value) axis. Follow the steps given to insert a column chart. Step 1 ? Arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet. Step 2 ? Select the data. Step 3 ? On the INSERT tab, in the Charts group, click the Column chart icon on the Ribbon. You will see the different options available for Column Charts.

In this chapter, you will understand when each of the column chart types is useful. Clustered Column and 3-D Clustered Column These chart types are useful to compare the values across a few categories, when the order of the categories is not important. Remember that ? A Clustered Column chart shows values in 2-D rectangular columns. A 3-D Clustered Column chart shows Columns in 3-D perspective, but it does not use a third value axis (depth axis). You can use Clustered Column charts when you have multiple data series with categories that represent ? Ranges of values (e.g. item counts). Specific scale arrangements (e.g. a Likert scale with entries like Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree). Names that are not in any specific order (e.g. item names, geographic names, or the names of people). Stacked Column and 3-D Stacked Column These charts are useful to ? Compare parts of a whole Show how parts of a whole change over time Compare parts of a whole across categories A Stacked Column chart displays values in 2-D vertical stacked rectangles. A 3-D Stacked Column chart displays the data by using a 3-D perspective, but it does not use a third value axis (depth axis). A 100% Stacked bar shows 2-D bars that compare the percentage that each value contributes to a total across the categories. 100% Stacked Column and 3-D 100% Stacked Column These charts are used to ? Compare the percentages that each value contributes to the total. Check, how the percentage that each value contributes changes over time. Compare the percentage that each value contributes across categories. A 100% Stacked Column chart shows values in 2-D columns that are stacked to represent 100%. A 3-D 100% Stacked Column chart shows the columns using a 3-D perspective, but it does use a third value axis (depth axis). You can use 100% Stacked Column charts when you have three or more data series and you want to emphasize the contributions to the whole, especially if the total is the same for each category. 3-D Column 3-D Column charts use three axes that you can modify (a horizontal axis, a vertical axis, and a depth axis), and they compare data points along the horizontal and the depth axes. You can use this chart when you want to compare the data across both the categories and the data series. Excel Charts - Line Chart Line charts can show continuous data over time on an evenly scaled Axis. Therefore, they are ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals, such as days, months, quarters or years. In a Line chart ? Category data is distributed evenly along the horizontal axis. Value data is distributed evenly along the vertical axis. Follow the steps given below to insert a Line chart in your worksheet. Step 1 ? Arrange the data in columns or rows on the worksheet.

In this chapter, you will understand when each of the line chart types is useful. Line and Line with Markers Line charts indicate individual data values. Line charts work best when you have multiple data series in your chart. Line charts can show trends over ? Time (days, months, quarters or years), or Evenly spaced Categories. A Line chart can be with or without markers. You can use a Line chart without markers when ? The order of categories is important. There are many categories or if the values are approximate. You can use a Line chart with Markers when ? The order of categories is important. There are only a few categories. Stacked Line and Stacked Line with Markers Stacked Line charts indicate individual data values. Stacked Line Charts can show the trend of the contribution of each value over ? Time, or Evenly spaced Categories. Stacked Line charts can be with or without markers. You can use a stacked line chart without markers when there are many categories or if the values are approximate. You can use a stacked line chart with markers when there are only a few categories. Reading Stacked Line charts can be difficult as ? They sum the data, which might not be the result you want. It might not be easy to see that the lines are stacked. To overcome the difficulties, you can use a Stacked Area chart instead. 100% Stacked Line and 100% Stacked Line with Markers 100% Stacked Line charts indicate individual data values. 100% Stacked Line charts can show the trend of the percentage of each value over ? Time, or Evenly spaced Categories 100% Stacked Line chart can be with or without Markers. You can use a 100% Stacked Line chart without Markers when there are many categories or if the values are approximate. You can use a 100% Stacked Line chart with markers when there are a few categories. Reading Stacked Line charts can be difficult. You can use a 100% Stacked Area chart instead. 3-D Line 3-D Line charts show each row or column of data as a 3-D Ribbon. 3-D Line charts can show trends over ? Time (days, months, quarters or years), or Categories. A 3-D Line chart has horizontal, vertical, and depth axes that you can change. The third axis can show some lines in front of others. Excel Charts - Pie Chart Pie charts show the size of the items in one data series, proportional to the sum of the items. The data points in a Pie chart are shown as a percentage of the whole Pie.

A preview of that chart type will be displayed on the worksheet. Consider using a Pie chart when ? You have only one data series. None of the values in your data are negative. Almost none of the values in your data are zero values. You have no more than seven categories, all of which represent parts of the whole pie. In this chapter, you will understand when each of the pie chart types is useful. Pie and 3-D Pie Pie charts show the contribution of each value to a total value in a 2-D or a 3-D format. You can pull out the slices of a Pie chart manually to emphasize the slices. Follow the steps given below to give the 3-D effect. Step 1 ? Click on a slice that you want to emphasize. Step 2 ? Pull it out of the chart. Use these chart types to show a proportion of the whole pie. Use these chart types when ? Number is equal to 100%. The chart contains only a few Pie slices. Pie of Pie and Bar of Pie Pie of Pie or Bar of Pie charts show Pie charts with smaller values pulled out into a secondary Pie or Stacked Bar chart, which makes them easier to distinguish. Use these chart types to ? Show proportions of the total value. Take some values from the first pie and combine them in a Second Pie, or Stacked Bar To make small percentages more readable, highlight the values in the second pie. Excel Charts - Doughnut Chart Area charts can be used to plot change over time (years, months and days) or categories and draw attention to the total value across a trend.

Step 5 ? Select/deselect the chart elements, which you want in your chart to be displayed, from the list. In this chapter, you will understand the different chart elements and their usage. Axes Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize the data ? A vertical axis (also known as value axis or y axis), and A horizontal axis (also known as category axis or x axis) 3-D Column charts have a third axis, the depth axis (also known as the series axis or the z axis), so that the data can be plotted along the depth of a chart. Radar charts do not have horizontal (Category) axes. Pie and Doughnut charts do not have any axes. Not all chart types display axes the same way. x y (Scatter) charts and Bubble charts show numeric values on both the horizontal axis and the vertical axes. Column, Line, and Area charts, show numeric values on the vertical (value) axis only and show textual groupings (or categories) on the horizontal axis. The depth (series) axis is another form of category axis. Axis Titles Axis titles give the understanding of the data of what the chart is all about. You can add axis titles to any horizontal, vertical, or the depth axes in the chart. You cannot add axis titles to charts that do not have axes (Pie or Doughnut charts). To add Axis Titles, Step 1 ? Click on the chart. Step 2 ? Click the Chart Elements icon. Step 3 ? From the list, select Axes Titles. Axes titles appear for horizontal, vertical and depth axes. Step 4 ?

Pivot charts are useful when you have the data in a huge Pivot table or a lot of complex worksheet data that includes text and numbers. A Pivot chart can help you make sense of this data. You can create a Pivot chart in the following ways ?
