But it is not the last one, as the last one is Windows Server 2016. Officially it was released on August 1st, 2012 and is being sold as a commercial version only. Improvements in Windows Server 2012 The major Improvements on this version are as follows ? It is ready to be integrated with cloud systems and it still can maintain the classic features of local datacenters as a result Hyper-V Virtualization has new features Hyper-v replicas, it allows you to create virtual machines replications between clusters and storage systems. The Storage migration virtual disks can be moved to different physical storages, Virtual machine snapshots, virtual machines can be deleted from the Hyper-v and also from the virtual disks and it can be used directly without the need to shut down the virtual machine. The Core server installation easily switches to GUI installation without the need of reinstallation. The file server and storage service improvement is that it eliminates identical copies in the same volumes as such and saves space. The Storage pools and storage spaces allows you to group the hard disks to one or more storage pools then it allows to create virtual disks. It can add other disks to the storage pools and make available to the users without impacting them. The iSCSI Target Server can offer block storage to other servers and applications on the network using the iSCSI standard. Active Directory cloning can deploy additional domain controllers by cloning an existing virtual domain controller. The Windows Server 2012 has four editions: Foundation, Essentials, Standard and Datacenter. Each one of them has their own limitation accept the Datacenter version which is also the most expensive one. The following table will show what is the right one for your business needs ?

Step 5 ? The last step will be to check the service that you want to install, but in the upcoming chapters we will continue this setup for each and every important services. Windows Server 2012 - PowerShell Windows PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. It’s analogue in Linux is called as Bash Scripting. Built on the .NET Framework, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals to control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows Server environment. Windows PowerShell commands, called cmdlets, let you manage the computers from the command line. Windows PowerShell providers let you access data stores, such as the Registry and Certificate Store, as easily as you access the file system. In addition, Windows PowerShell has a rich expression parser and a fully developed scripting language. So in simple words you can complete all the tasks that you do with GUI and much more. PowerShell Icon can be found in the task bar and in the start menu. Just by clicking on the icon, it will open. To open it, just click on the icon and then the following screen will open and it means that PowerShell is ready for you to work on.

Check on the tick box ? User must change password at next logon. The user will be forced to change the password when the user logs in ? Click Next ? and then click Finish. Windows Server 2012 - File System In Windows Server 2012 a new file system it is presented with is caller Resilient File System (ReFS). The key attributes of ReFS include ? Maintaining a high level of data availability and reliability, even when the individual underlying storage devices experience failures. Providing a full, end-to-end resilient architecture when used in conjunction with Storage Spaces. When used together, ReFS and Storage Spaces provide enhanced resiliency to storage device failures. The significant functionality included with ReFS is described below ? Integrity ? ReFS stores data in a way that protects it from many of the common errors that can normally cause data loss. When ReFS is used in conjunction with a mirror space or a parity space, detected corruption — both metadata and user data, when integrity streams are enabled — can be automatically repaired using the alternate copy provided by Storage Spaces. In addition, there are Windows PowerShell cmdlets (Get-FileIntegrity and Set-FileIntegrity) that you can use to manage the integrity and disk scrubbing policies. Availability ? ReFS prioritizes the availability of data. Historically, file systems were often susceptible to data corruption that would require the system to be taken offline for repair. With ReFS, if corruption occurs, the repair process is both localized to the area of corruption and performed online, requiring no volume downtime. Although rare, if a volume does become corrupted or you choose not to use it with a mirror space or a parity space, ReFS implements salvage, a feature that removes the corrupt data from the namespace on a live volume and ensures that good data is not adversely affected by non-repairable corrupt data. Because ReFS performs all repair operations online, it does not have an offline chkdsk command. Scalability ? As the amount and size of data that is stored on computers continues to rapidly increase, ReFS is designed to work well with extremely large data sets — petabytes and larger — without performance impact. ReFS is not only designed to support volume sizes of 2^64 bytes (allowed by Windows stack addresses), but ReFS is also designed to support even larger volume sizes of up to 2^78 bytes using 16 KB cluster sizes. This format also supports 2^64 – 1-byte file sizes, 2^64 files in a directory and the same number of directories in a volume. Proactive Error Correction ? The integrity capabilities of ReFS are leveraged by a data integrity scanner, which is also known as a scrubber. The integrity scanner periodically scans the volume, identifying latent corruptions and proactively triggering a repair of that corrupt data. When the metadata for a ReFS directory is corrupted, subfolders and their associated files are automatically recovered. ReFS identifies and recovers the files while ReFS remains online. Unrecoverable corruption of the ReFS directory metadata affects only those files that are in the directory in which the corruption has occurred. ReFS includes a new registry entry, RefsDisableLastAccessUpdate, which is the equivalent of the previous NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate registry entry. The new storage command lets in Windows PowerShell are available (Get-FileIntegrity and SetFileIntegrity) for you to manage the integrity and disk scrubbing policies. Group Managed Service Accounts The Managed Service Accounts (MSA) was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 to automatically manage (change) passwords of service accounts. Using MSA, you can considerably reduce the risk of system accounts running system services being compromised. MSA has one major problem which is the usage of such service account only on one computer. It means that MSA Service Accounts cannot work with cluster or NLB services, which operate simultaneously on multiple servers and use the same account and password. To fix this, Microsoft added the feature of Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) to Windows Server 2012. To create a gMSA, we should follow the steps given below ? Step 1 ? Create the KDS Root Key. This is used by the KDS service on DC to generate passwords. To use the key immediately in the test environment, you can run the PowerShell command ? 
Add-KdsRootKey –EffectiveTime ((get-date).addhours(-10)) 
 To check whether it creates successfully or not, we run the PowerShell command ? 
Get-KdsRootKey 
 Step 2 ? To create and configure gMSA ? Open the Powershell terminal and type ? New – ADServiceAccount – name gmsa1 – DNSHostNamedc1.example.com – PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword "gmsa1Group" In which, gmsa1 is the name of the gMSA account to be created. dc1.example.com is the DNS server Name. gmsa1Group is the active directory group which includes all systems that have to be used. This group should be created before in the Groups. To check it, Go to ? Server Manager ? Tools ? Active Directory Users and Computers ? Managed Service Accounts. Step 3 ? To install gMAs on a server ? open PowerShell terminal and type in the following commands ? Install ? ADServiceAccount – Identity gmsa1 Test ? ADServiceAccount gmsa1 The result should come “True” after running the second command, as shown in the screenshot given below. Step 4 ? Go to service properties, specify that the service will be run with a gMSA account. In the This account box in the Log on tab type the name of the service account. At the end of the name use symbol $, the password need not to be specified. After the changes are saved, the service has to be restarted. The account will get the “Log On as a Service” and the password will be retrieved automatically. Group Policy Overview The features of Group Policy Management were installed during the DC Role Installation. Many of the management features haven’t changed as compared to the previous versions of Windows Server. To create a GPO (Group Policy Overview), we need to follow the steps given below. Step 1 ? To create a GPO open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), go to Server Manager ? Tools ? Group Policy Management as shown in the screenshot below. Step 2 ? Right-click on an OU ? select the first option Create a GPO in this domain and Link it here. Step 3 ? Type the Name for this GPO object ? click OK button. We have selected the name as Test GPO. Step 4 ? Right-click the GPO object and click Edit.
