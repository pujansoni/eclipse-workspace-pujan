SAP C4C is available in 19 languages as on May 2015. You can easily integrate C4C solution to SAP ECC, CRM and Outlook using SAP NW Process Integration or SAP HANA Cloud Integration HCI for standard scenarios. SAP C4C is a new product of SAP based on SaaS (software as a service), PaaS (Platform as a service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). SAP C4C connecters are available for popular middleware like Dell Boomi for cloud integration, Informatica, MuleSoft for application integration etc. Advantages of SAP C4C Following are the benefits of using C4C management ? One of the key benefits of using SAP C4C is its operation expenditure cost and operation maintenance. You can take licenses as per your requirement and it can be increased on demand. SAP C4C solution is managed by vendor and all operational costs and maintenance is the vendor’s responsibility. SAP C4C solution allows you to manage customer needs from anywhere and with seven-layer security from cloud service providers. You can access all customer information regardless where they are stored or available. SAP C4C is based on cloud and use secure and fast communication using web, mobile and supporting mobile platforms iOS, Android and Windows devices, in both online and offline mode. SAP C4C vs On-Premise Given below are the key differences between Cloud for Customer and on-premise solution ? Feature Cloud for Customer On Premise Company owned Solution location On Cloud. Off the premise On Premise Solution Ownership SAP/subscription Company owned Business Model Operational Expenditure Capital Expenditure Cost Less High Licenses and Users As per demand Peak Solution Management Vendor Company Capital Expenditure Only operational expenditure like end-users’ system and user creation Cost of IT infrastructure is very high. Example:Servers and user licenses etc. SAP C4C - Architecture SAP C4C provides prepacked integration for SAP ECC, CRM and Outlook. It consists of HTML5 UI, Silverlight UI, and mobile Apps for IOS, Android platform and HANA for HANA Cloud integration HCI. SAP C4C has multitenant architecture where solution and components is shared between multiple customers. There is an option to go for single tenant by paying additional cost. In a multiple tenant environment, all the updates and releases are built on C4C custom solutions for multiple clients. SAP C4C solution can be easily integrated with SAP ERP and CRM on premise solution. There are two ways of integration ? SAP Process Integration PI/PO ? This integration is recommended when you are already using process integration for on premise systems. SAP HANA Cloud Integration HCI ? This integration is recommended when you have to perform cloud-to-cloud integration. The C4C integration to CRM on-premise could be on the basis of ? Level of customization required Whether the functionality is required to be on the cloud/on the field The master data governance rules within the company Sales organization structure, etc. Example The frontline sales team will generate opportunities on the move with minimal information. The Top 5 - Customer, Product, Opportunity Phase, Value, Volume and the sales assistants in the back-office will enhance the opportunities with more data that are replicated to the on-premise solution. The C4C integration to ERP could be on the basis of types of transactions needed to be displayed to the front end sales like orders, quotations or contracts. It is based on the role of the sales person whether they need pricing information, availability checks or even customer credit information. The principle here could be that of only deploying a "Must Have" integration with the ERP transactions. SAP C4C - Public vs Private When a customer goes for SAP C4C production tenant, there is a test tenant provided as free to the customer. A separate unique URL is provided for each tenant. A customer can also purchase permanent test tenant subscription. SAP C4C solution is hosted on cloud tenant that has many customers. This is called a public tenant. C4C customers can also go for private purchase edition, which allows them to subscribe for a tenant with no other customer on it. SAP C4C production and test tenants are always of separate system. A customer cannot purchase a permanent test tenant for temporary basis. It is recommended only when SDK solution is in use. SAP Cloud hosting cannot differentiate between a permanent and a temporary test tenant. It only supports up to two test tenants irrespective of which a customer can consider as temporary tenant and a permanent tenant. Using a test and production tenant, a project can be implemented in the following way as demonstrated in the figure ? SAP C4C administrator can manage the test and production tenants using Service Control Center ?

C4C Adaption – Extension Fields Extension fields are additional fields that the administrators can add to the solution in order to meet a specific business requirement. If applicable, these features add new field to the end of the data migration worksheet. When you first create an extension field, you navigate to a screen on which you want it to appear and add it to a section of the screen. Each screen section is based on an underlying business context. The business context typically corresponds to a part of a business document or other object. For example, the header data of sales quote. The business context is used to determine which other screens you can add the field to. In addition, it is also used to determine the form templates, analytical data sources and reports, enterprise search categories, and extension scenarios that the field can be added to. To add a new field, first you need to navigate to the relevant screen and enter Adaptation mode via Adapt ? Edit Master Layout. The area of the screen is where the new field should be created, i.e., in the account details area.

Important Terms in Reporting Following are the key terms used in reporting in SAP C4C ? Key Figures Key figures are defined as key performance indicators in the report. You can also refine the data appearing in key figures by setting up restricted or calculated key figures. You can define a restricted key figure as key figure restricted to a specified characteristic value and is often created for comparison metrics. In C4C reporting, a calculated key figure is defined as the key figure that contains some calculation rules or formulas. A calculated key figure can be created from existing key figures in the selected data source. Characteristics These are assigned to restricted key figures and to add additional behavior you can define properties of the characteristics. Work Centers You should assign the reports to work centers to make them available to users. Assigning Reports to Roles You can also enable the assignment of reports to business roles when you implement a new project under fine tuning option. This allows you to assign reports to business roles directly and hence restricts by role which users can view the reports that are assigned in work center. To enable this: You can go to Administrator ? Analytics ? Settings Report Views When you assign a report to the work center, you can create views, which appear in enduser report list. A view can be created by choosing key figures and characteristics for columns and rows in a table, then selecting a chart type to best represent that data. When you create a view, you can also define conditions and exceptions for key figures that alter how your data is presented based on rules and thresholds.

Joined Data Sources allows you to merge the data between two or more data sources and merging results the matching of data. SAP C4C - Service Level In SAP Cloud for Customer, service level defines the time when a ticket for a customer must be responded and completed. Service levels help the organizations define objectives for handling customer messages. Using these, you can measure the performance and the quality of your customer service. Service levels also help to define new rules as per the ticket category and description whenever a new customer message comes in the C4C system. Using service levels, a system can determine the service level based on those rules, and then based on that service level, the initial response and completion due time points are calculated. Create a Service Level Step 1 To define Service Levels, go to Administrator ? Service and Social. Step 2 Click Service Level in the next window that opens. Step 3 Click New and select Service Level. A new window will open. Step 4 Click the General tab. Enter the Service level Name, Service Level ID and Description.
