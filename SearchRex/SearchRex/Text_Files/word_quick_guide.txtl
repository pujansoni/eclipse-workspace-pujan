Microsoft Word provides a functionality to apply zoom-in and zoom-out operations on a document. When we apply the zoom-in operation, it enlarges the size of text whereas applying the zoom-out operation reduces the size of text. A zoom operation just changes the size of the font on-screen without impacting any other attribute of the document. You can apply the zoom operation in various ways as explained in this chapter. Zoom-in & Zoom-out using view tab Here is the simple procedure to apply the zoom-in or the zoom-out operations using the View tab ? Step 1 ? Click the View tab and then click the Zoom button as shown below. Step 2 ? When you click the Zoom button, a Zoom dialog box will appear as shown below. This will display the zoom options box to select a value to reduce or increase the size of the document on-screen. By default, it will be 100%; you can select 200% to increase the size of the font or 75% to reduce the size of the font. You can click the Many pages down arrow and select to display multiple pages. Step 3 ? Once you are done with selecting an option, click OK to apply the changes on the document. Step 4 ? Try different options available, for example Page Width and Text Width. Zoom-in & Zoom-out using (+) and (-) Buttons The following screenshot shows two buttons Zoom-out which is the (-) button and Zoom-in which is the (+) button. Step 1 ? Click the Zoom-out button, you will find that your document size will decrease by 10% each time you click the button. Similar way, if you click on Zoom-in button your document size will increase by 10% each time you click the button. Step 2 ? Try this simple operation with different values to see the difference. The above screenshot shows 140% zoom-in view of the document. Special Symbols in Word 2010 In this chapter, we will discuss the use of special symbols in Word 2010.

To insert symbols that are occasionally used, follow the steps in this section. If you find yourself using a particular symbol frequently, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it. Insert Special Symbols Here is a simple procedure to apply zoom-in or zoom-out operation using the View tab ? Step 1 ? To insert a special symbol, bring your cursor at the place where you want to insert the symbol. Click the Insert tab. You will find two options under the symbol button (a) Equation and (b) Symbols. Click either of these two options based on your requirement. You will further use equations while preparing mathematical or scientific or any similar document. For now, we are going to understand the use of the Symbol button as shown below. Step 2 ? When you click the Symbol button, a small list of symbols will appear as shown below. Step 3 ? Now click on any of the available symbols in the box to insert that in your document at the selected location. If you do not find the desired symbol in this small box, then you can click at the More Symbols option to have a wide range of symbols as shown below in the symbol dialog box. You can select any of the symbol and then click the Insert button to insert the selected symbol. Assign Shortcut Key You can assign a keyboard shortcut to type any of the available symbol.

Undo Changes in Word 2010 In this chapter, we will discuss how to undo and redo changes in Word 2010. Microsoft word provides two important features called the Undo and the Repeat or Redo. The Undo feature is used to undo the previous action and the Repeat or Redo feature is used to repeat the previous action. For example, if you mistakenly delete text, you can use the Undo feature to recover it. In a similar way, if you delete a character and you want to delete more characters then you can use the Repeat operation. How to use Undo & Repeat operations You can access the Undo and Repeat buttons from the Quick Access toolbar. You should make a note that the Repeat button is also called Redo button and both the operations have the same meaning. Here is the simple procedure to apply undo or repeat (redo) operations ? Step 1 ? Let us type some text in a blank document. Now click the Repeat (Redo) button and you will see that Word will repeat the same operation for you. Step 2 ? Now to examine the undo operation, let us delete the last word operation character by character so that you have the following text remaining in the line. Step 3 ? Let us try to click the Undo button one by one. You will see that Word will recover all the deleted characters one by one after performing a few undo operations. Shortcuts to use Undo & Repeat operations Though you can access the Undo and Repeat commands from the Quick Access toolbar, but because these commands are the most frequently used commands, we recommend you memorize their keyboard shortcuts which are as follows ? S.No Shortcuts & Operation 1 Ctrl + Z Undoes the previous action. 2 Ctrl + Y Repeats the previous action. Note that if the previous action was Undo, Ctrl+Y redoes the Undone action.
