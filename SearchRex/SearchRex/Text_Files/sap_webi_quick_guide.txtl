Web Intelligence is a Business Intelligence reporting tool for business users to analyze data in Data Warehouse. It assists business managers in the decision-making process for building future strategies. Using Web Intelligence, business users can create basic, medium, and complex reports from transactional data in database and by creating Universes using Information Design Tool/UDT. Various SAP and non-SAP data sources can be used to create reports in Web Intelligence. SAP Business Warehouse (BW) system doesn’t require a Universe to connect to Web Intelligence tool. Web Intelligence tool can work as a client tool of BusinessObjects platform and also as a standalone tool for reporting. Versions and History BusinessObjects was first started in 1990 with the tool name Skipper SQL 2.x, and in the year 1994 Business Objects v3.0 was launched. In 2005, BO XI was released and later on various other versions introduced. Some of the versions are ? BO XI R1 BO XI R2 BO XI R3 BO XI R3.1 BO XI R3.2 In 2007, SAP acquired this company for $6.8 billion and the product has been renamed as SAP BusinessObjects. Later in the year 2011, BO XI 4.0 was introduced. The latest version of the tool is SAP BO 4.2. Web Intelligence Architecture SAP Webi has a three-layered architecture ? Database Layer ? This layer defines multiple SAP and non-SAP data sources. Semantic Layer ? This layer defines multidimensional data model. Presentation Layer ? This layer defines where data is presented to end-users. Various data sources can be used to create analytical and ad hoc reports. You can pull data from SAP systems, like SAP ECC, SAP ERP, SAP SRM, and other SAP modules. Non-SAP data sources include Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, and Sybase. SAP Webi - BI Launchpad BI Launchpad is a Java or HTML based interface of BusinessObjects tool to perform analytical reporting and data analysis. You can set the preference for your BI Launchpad that determines which tool interface is launched via Launchpad. Using Web or Internet Application to access Webi interface via BI Launchpad, you can perform the following tasks ? Create, edit and refresh all the reports in Web Intelligence. Create and edit all the queries in no data source (Universes) but not BEx queries in Web application. Note ? If you are using Webi 4.0 SP2, it is not possible to create queries and you can only work on documents and reports. BI Launchpad has the following important tabs ? Home ? Displays recent messages, alerts, documents, and applications that can be run. Documents ? Displays the available documents and folders, making it easier to view, organize, and manage the documents. Any open Document ? Displays each open document. You can use the Application tab to start an application including Web Intelligence. You can use the Preference tab to define BI Launchpad preferences. Logging to BI Launchpad As mentioned, BI Launchpad is HTML5 or Java-based web interface to launch an application via BI Launchpad. To access BI Launchpad, you should have a web URL, user name and password. Access profile to be set for the resources. To get the BI Launchpad details and user credentials you can reach the BO Administrator using the link, http://BOSERVER:8080/BOE/BI To login to BI Launchpad, open the web browser and enter the Launchpad URL provided by your administrator. The following screen pops up. Select the system name you want to login. Enter the user name and password. In the Authentication dropdown, select the Authentication type - Enterprise, Windows AD, etc. (In the above snapshot, this server has a single login). Click ‘Log On’ and it will open the home page for BI Launchpad. You can use Applications tab of Launchpad to run any of the application. SAP Webi - BI Preferences Let us now discuss how to set BI preferences. Setting BI Preferences You can set BI Launchpad preferences for the following tasks. General Preferences ? These are defined by the administrator. You can reset your password. You can also set time zone, locales preferences, and Web Intelligence preferences. General Tab ? Using this tab you can set user default settings. Change Password ? As per your user access. Locales and Time Zone ? To set product locale, preferred viewing locale, current time zone.

You can set the drill options. You can also select saving priorities when saving a report in .xls format. BI Workspaces ? Used to select a default stylesheet to use when creating a new workspace. Crystal Reports ? Used to set crystal reports options like printing options, default measuring unit, etc. SAP Webi - Application Modes There are three different application modes that can be used to build the queries, create documents and to analyze the reports. When you open an existing report, the following modes are available ? Data Reading Design Data Application Mode In this mode, you can create new data provider, change an existing data source or rename a data provider. You can also create, edit, and manage queries, which is used to pass data to reports. In Data mode, it shows the list of all the available data providers. All the options in tool mode are disabled in this mode. Reading Mode This mode allows you to display existing reports, search text, monitor changes in the reports, and drill down on the data in the report. You can also use the left panel and tool bar in the Reading mode. Design Mode Design mode allows you to add, delete objects in a report, applying conditional formatting, applying formulas in report, creating variables, etc. Design mode with Structure only allows you to view the structure of the report. All the changes that you make in this mode, they are not applied to the server till you populate it with data. In Design mode with data, all the modifications applied in a report are on the server. In case you have to make a lot of changes in an existing report, it is recommended to make changes in structure mode and then populate the report with data. SAP Webi - Creating Documents In this chapter, we will learn how to create Webi documents. Creating Documents in Webi When you open Web interface via BI Launchpad or open Webi rich client, you have an option to create a new document or edit an existing one. You can create a new document as blank document or use an interface to create a document based on the following data sources ? Universe Flat files in .csv or .xls format BEx queries Analysis view Rich Internet application interface and Webi rich client allows you to use from list of available data sources; however, Web Interface supports only no data source or Universe from IDT/UDT. Data Source Web Interface via BI Launchpad Rich Internet Application Interface Web Rich Client Tool No Data Yes Yes Yes .unx or .unv Universe file Yes Yes Yes BW BEx Query No Yes Yes Analysis View No Yes Yes Text Files CSV and XLS No Yes Yes To create a blank document to use later ?

Select the specific name and enter the name you want to send the document. You can also select “shortcut” to send a shortcut or “Copy” option to send a copy of the document. Sending Documents Using FTP To send a document via ftp, login to BI Launchpad. You have to save the document first. Click ‘Save’ icon at the top of the screen to save the document. Click ‘Mail’ icon in the tool bar ? Select ‘Send to Ftp’. You have to enter the host name, port number, user name and password. Select the naming method for document to send. Click ‘Send’. SAP Webi - Managing Reports Webi documents contain at least one or more reports. You can manage multiple reports in a single Webi document. You can also add, delete, rename, and move existing reports in one Webi document. To add, delete, or move a report in a Webi document, right-click on the Report tab. Add, Delete, Rename, Save a Report To add a report, right-click on the existing report tab and click ‘Add Report’. To delete a report, right-click on the report tab and click ‘Delete’. Each Webi document should have at least one report. You can use “Rename Report” option to rename an existing report. To save a document in Webi, you have options to save a report locally, save in BI repository, or export as CSV format. To do this, go to File tab and choose from the options Save/Save As/Save as Enterprise. If you open a Webi document, you can click ‘Save’ to keep the changes. ‘Save as’ option is used to save a document in different formats such as ? WID PDF Excel Excel 2007 CSV Achieve TXT File When you use the ‘Save as’ option, on the right side of the screen you get many options – Refresh on open, Permanent Regional formatting, Save for all users, Remove document Security. You can enter the report name, change an existing report name and also add a description. SAP Webi - Using Queries Queries in Webi are managed in the Query panel. When you create a Webi report, you use queries in the query panel to get data from the data source. Queries can be created from different interfaces like you can create queries based on Universe, represent data in OLAP database as objects, flat files like Excel and CSV files, data in SAP InfoCubes using BEx queries, Analysis view or Query as a web service. Each query has dimensions and measures. Measures always return numeric data based on the calculation and other objects in the data source. Queries can be hierarchical or non-hierarchical in nature. Non-hierarchical queries have no relationship between the objects. Hierarchies define relationship between the objects. For example: In a Geographical hierarchy, you have measures based on geographical hierarchies like counties, states and cities. Using hierarchies, you can drill up and down to see data at the next level. Query panel is not available, if you use Web Interface of Webi tool. Query Definition In a Webi document, you retrieve data in report from the data source using the query panel. All the queries are built in the query panel and interface of query panel depends on the data source you are using to get data. Queries can be created on Universe, which contains Relational and OLAP data models, data from flat files like CVS, XLS files, SAP BW BEx query, and Analysis view. Query is run to get data from the data source. You can apply filters and also preview data in the query panel. To open a Query Panel ? Go to Web Intelligence ? New ? Select Data Source ? Ok. When you click ‘Ok’, you have to select data source from the list of selected data source type. New window will open known as Query Panel. Select the objects from Universe outline, which you want to add to the report in result objects. To add a filter, select the object in Query filters by dragging an object and select a value. For data preview, click ‘Refresh’ tab. To add this query to the report, click ‘Run Query’ option at the top of the screen to add to Webi document. Query and Documents User Rights You can view multiple objects in the Query panel and create, edit, and delete objects in queries as per login user access rights. Users are normally created by BusinessObjects Administrator. CMC is used to create user profiles to login to BO tools. If you don’t have enough access rights, you will not be able to access few objects of a report. Access rights are defined by the BO administrator. Classes and Subclasses Classes are used to group similar objects in a report. A class can contain one or more subclasses. Subclasses contains further subcategory of objects in the upper level of a class. Classes are used to organize objects in a logical manner. While creating queries on Universe, you can find the information on objects that you have to use in query. Dimension Dimension lists all the objects using which we want to analyze the data. Dimension provides the basis for analysis in a report. Dimension normally contains non-hierarchical character type data like customer name, product name, customer address, sales office address, etc. Common examples of Dimensions are - Product, Customer, Time, etc. Analysis Dimension ? An analysis dimension contains group of hierarchies related to each other. When you add an analysis dimension in a report, its default hierarchy appears in query. ? Analysis Dimension appears as this symbol in the query panel Attributes and Measures Attribute provides data about dimensions or hierarchy. For example ? Home address of a customer dimension. Attribute has one-to-one relationship with corresponding dimension. Each customer has only one address object. ? Attribute appears as this symbol in the query panel If your Universe is not designed correctly, an object returns the multiple values for a dimension and the corresponding cell in the report shows MULTIVALUE error. Measures are defined as numerical values in the report on which analysis is performed. They are integer values, which are used to compare the performance of an organization with defined KPI’s. For example ? Sales in each region, total Revenue per year, profit per product, etc. ? Measure appears as this symbol in the query panel Hierarchies A hierarchy represents parent-child relationship in Universe. It allows you to drill up or down in the report to the next level. For example ? Geography hierarchy contains Country, State and City. Time hierarchy contains Year, Quarter, Month and Week. Using the member selector in defining hierarchy, you can define which member appears in the result set. In hierarchical data sources, hierarchies are associated with a dimension. Members and Named Set in Hierarchy Members are defined at different level of hierarchies in a data source. For example ? Consider a Geography hierarchy containing members – “India” at the country level and “Haryana” at the State level. You can also include individual members in query from hierarchy, if you don’t want to add all the members. Named set can be used to define a set of members. A named set is defined as named expression and results a set of members. You can define named set at Universe level or a relational or OLAP database level. SAP Webi - Queries using Universe You can build queries in the Query panel using various data sources like Universe, BEx from SAP BW or an Analysis view. Using Universe for Building Queries Universe contains data from OLAP and Relational data sources. Data in Universe can be a relational data or hierarchical data. Open Web Intelligence via BI Launchpad ? New (Create a new Webi document). You will be prompted to select a Data Source. Select a Universe as data source and click ‘Ok’. You will get a list of all available Universe. Select a Universe, which you want to use to create a Webi document. A new window will open with the name Query Panel. In the query panel, on the left side of the screen, you have a list of available objects. You have Result Objects where you drag objects from the left panel, which you want to add in a Webi document. You have Query Filter using which you can add different filters. Data Preview can be used to view data before it is added to Webi document. Run query tab at the top of the screen is used to run the query. In the Query panel, you have an option using which you can add data from multiple sources in a single Webi document by creating multiple queries. To add a Query, go to Add query option at the top of the screen. You can select different data sources to add a second query. You can also edit the properties of Query, like the name of the query, number of records, etc. ‘View Script’ option allows you to check the script of the query. Following functions can be set using Query Properties ? Sr.No. Function & Properties 1. Retrieving duplicate rows Relational .unx, OLAP, but not available in BEx queries. 2. Returning sample result sets Available in relational .unx, but not available in OLAP .unx or BEx queries. 3. Retrieving/excluding empty rows Available in OLAP .unx only. Not available in BEx queries. In this case, you have an option to run multiple queries separately. You can go to Run queries and select the query you want to run. You can also combine queries using the Query Panel. SAP Webi - Queries using BEx You can create Webi documents based on BEx (Business Exchange Queries) created by BEx Query Designer, which is based on InfoCube in SAP BW system. You can connect to a BEx query in Webi with the use of BI Consumer Service (BICS) connection. You need not create Universe for BEx queries, and all attributes, hierarchies, dimensions and measures are automatically mapped in Webi document. You can edit, create, and refresh documents based on BEx using Web Intelligence Rich Internet Application Interface (Applet based) or Webi Rich Client. If you are using Webi DHTML web interface, you can only view or refresh a Webi document based on BEx but you cannot edit them. Following important points about BEx should be considered ? You can only use BEx queries, which are flagged with “Allow External Access to the Query”. To manage object mapping, refer to restriction and equivalent pages to ensure correct use of queries. Following metadata objects are supported from BEx in Webi ? Hierarchies Characteristics Navigation Attributes Display Attributes Basic Key Figures Calculation figures and formulas Restricted Key figures Variables Customized Structure How to Enable Access to BEx Query? Open BEx Query Designer and select the query you want to use in BO tool. Go to Properties ? Advanced tab and select Allow External access to Query. Save the query. BICS Connection in CMC You can create a BICS connection in CMC or also in Information Design Tool. A connection can be created to a single BEx query or to an Info Provider. Login to CMC console ? Select OLAP connection from the dropdown list. Click on a New Connection ? In Provider list, select SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse. Similarly, you can define a BICS connection in IDT. Select an OLAP connection and choose SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse ? SAP BICS Client Middleware driver. How to Use BEx as Data Source in WebI Rich Client? Open Webi Rich Client ? New Document. Click on select a BEx query as data source. In the new window, select BICS connection in the right pane and corresponding BEx query ? Ok. All the objects from BEx will be added to Query Panel on the left side. You can drag the objects to Result Objects. Once you click on Run query, all the result objects will be added to a new Webi document as shown in the following snapshot. SAP Webi - Queries using Analysis View Analysis view is created in BI workspace. Analysis views with custom objects are not supported and it only supports Analysis view coming from SAP NetWeaver BW. Open Webi Rich Client ? New Document ? Select Analysis view as Data source. Select an Analysis View, and click ‘Ok’. Managing Queries To manage multiple queries, you have an option of Data at the top right corner. This option is not available in Webi DHTML interface. All the data providers appear in the list to the right side of the data pane. It also tells you the Data Source, Refresh date, Duration, status, etc. To see the details of data, double-click on the Query. It will open the details of data added in Query. To edit a query, right-click on query in Data mode. Select edit or you can also select an option of Edit in the tool menu. You can also Rename, Delete, Copy or Purge a query using this Data Manager option. SAP Webi - Query Filters Query filters are used to limit the rows returned in a Webi document. Query filters allow you to hide the data that you don’t want to show to specific people and also limit the size of .wid document. When you run a query, it only returns the rows that meet the query filter definition. Following are the key features used in Query filter ? You can retrieve data as per specific business requirement. You can hide the data that you don’t want specific users to see in a Webi document. Limit the size of Webi document of the network and hence provides performance optimization. Example ? Being an Area Sales Manager for NY, you want to see the margin values for your region. Sales universe contains data from all the regions in United States. Also you only want to see data from the stores in NY where the sales margin is greater than 100K USD in the second Quarter (Q2) 2015. Now to create a Webi document with this information, you have to apply filters on these dimensions - State, Year, and Quarter and Filter on sales margin. Filter Operator AND Filter Condition Year = 2015 Quarter = Q2 State = NY Sales Margin >= 100000 Difference between Query Filters and Report Filters Query filters are applied in Query Panel and they are used to limit the number of rows from data sources and to return the same in the document. Report filters are applied at the report level on reports, tables, charts, etc. These filters are not used to limit the data retrieval from the data source and only hide certain values at the report level. Query Filter Structure Query filter is applied in this format ? Object (On which filter is applied), Operator (You can use various comparison operators), and Operand. Operand ? You can select from the following list of Operands ? Constant List of Values (LOVs) Prompt Universe Object Result from Other Query Operators ? You can select from the following operators ? Equal to (=) Not Equal to Greater than Less than Greater than Equal to Less than Equal to Between SAP Webi - Query Filter Types Following types of query filters are normally used ? Predefined Filters Custom Filters Quick Filters Prompts You can add multiple filter types on a single query. Predefined Query Filters These filters are normally Administrators and saved at the Universe level. They are used to populate data that is permanently available. These filters require some good knowledge of database design and complex expressions. Using predefined filters on Universe means you don’t need to create custom filter every time when a new Webi document is created. Also note that you can’t access the components of Predefined filters and it is also not possible to edit them. To add a Predefined filter, you can drag or double-click this filter to Query Panel ? Filters Pane. When you run the query, corresponding data w.r.t filters will be added to the report. How to Use a Predefined filter? You can use a Predefined filter by a double-click or just by dragging the filter to Query Filter. Quick Filters Quick filters are used to quickly retrieve the values you want without the use of filter editor. Quick filters use equal to operator while using a single value or list in operator when you use multiple values. Quick filters can’t be used with BEx queries. How to Use a Quick Filter? Quick filters are used in Query panel. To apply a Quick Filter, select the object you want to filter. Select ‘Add Quick Filter’ at the top right corner of Result Object Pane. New dialog box will open. You have to select the value you want to use in the Quick filter from LOVs. That filter will be added Query Filters pane. To delete this filter, select the filter in Query filter pane and press ‘Delete’ button. Custom Query Filters You can also create custom query filters to meet the business requirement or to hide the data from specific users. To create custom query filter, add the object you want to use in the filter. Drag it to Query filter pane. Click the arrow next to default operator and select the operator. Click on the arrow to select the filter type. You can select the following filter type ? Constant Value from list Prompt Object from this query Result from another query Select the value from this that you want to include in the filter. To remove a filter, select the filter and press ‘Delete’ button. To remove all the filters, use ‘Remove All’ option at the top right corner of the screen. Prompts Prompt is defined as a special filter for users, which allows them to enter a value every time data is refreshed in the document. Using prompts, you have multiple users viewing one document to display different sub set of data in database. Prompts allow you to retrieve the data from database and reduce the time. Following are the elements of a Prompt ? An Object An Operator Message Example ? Current Year Equal to (“Enter the Year”). In this Prompt, Current Year is the object, “Equal to” is the Operator and prompt message is “Enter the Year”. A Prompt can be applied to Dimension, Measures, attributes, hierarchies, etc. You can use AND, OR operators to create multiple prompts in the same query. While using BEx and .unx Universe, you can only use AND operator with prompts. Merged Prompts When you use multiple data providers in a single document, you can merge multiple prompts with same data type, same operator types and same prompt text are merged. While refreshing all the data providers, one prompt appears for all multiple prompts. LOVs displayed by merged prompt is the list associated with the object in prompt with the most displayed property constraints. Hierarchical Prompts You can also create hierarchical prompts where the following objects display their LOVs hierarchically in a Prompt ? Hierarchies Levels Dimensions associated with hierarchical LOVs Hierarchical prompts are displayed in a tree form and you can navigate up and down the tree. As per the filters in Prompt, you can select items from different levels of LOVs. Building Prompts To build a prompt, add the object you want to filter with a prompt to Query Filter pane. Select the filter operator from the list and click on the last arrow mark to select a prompt. You can add the text message for Prompt value and run the query. When you run the query, Prompt dialog box will allow you to enter the values as per the selected operator. When the values are selected and you click ‘Ok’, and the data for selected values in the document will be reflected. When you refresh the document in Webi, prompt will appear every time to select the values. Select an Existing Prompt You can also select from existing prompts to add to the query in query panel. To use an existing prompt, drag the object on which prompt has to be applied to query filter pane. Select from Universe, select an existing Prompt ? Ok. It will display the list of all prompts that are compatible with the object in Query filter. Deleting a Prompt To delete a prompt, select the prompt in Query filter pane and press the ‘Delete’ button. You can also select Remove or Remove all option. Combining Prompts with Query Filter You can also combine prompts with query filters to limit the data in the document and to select a specific record from the filtered data. Example ? You can apply Query filters for Department and Year and Prompt for a specific Employee name input. 
State Not Equal to Florida
Year 2005
Which Category
 When you run the query, it will ask you to enter the value for Category. In Webi document, it will filter the data as per filters in the query panel and display the result according to Prompt value. Order of Prompts You can also use multiple prompts in a single query. To add multiple prompts, drag all the objects on which you want to apply prompts. Select prompt by clicking on Arrow mark in the end of query. To define the order of Prompts, you have to go to Query properties at the top. From there, you can select the order of prompts as per requirement. You can move up/down a prompt from the list. Subqueries for Data Filtering Subqueries provides a more flexible option to filter the data as compared to an ordinary query filter. Using subqueries, you can limit the values returned with a WHERE clause. You can also compare the values of objects in a subquery with the other objects. Using subqueries, you can implement complex logic to limit the size of data, which is not possible to apply with simple query filters. Subqueries work on SQL which is used to retrieve the query data. SQL is supported by most of RDBMS and each database uses its own syntax. If any database doesn’t support SQL, an option to create a subquery will not highlight in the query panel. Subqueries can be built on dimensions, measures and attributes and not on the hierarchical objects. Building a Subquery Select the object in the result pane on which you want to build a subquery. It will add a subquery outline in the Query filter pane. Now if you want to add a WHERE condition, drag an object to the area of subquery. Select the Operator and Value used to filter object in WHERE condition. You can add multiple subqueries to query panel. You can use “AND” or “OR” relationship between subqueries. To change the relationship, you can click on AND to change it to OR. By default, two subqueries are linked with an AND relationship. You can also nest a subquery. Drag a subquery to the area and drop an object. Parameters ? You can use the following parameters while passing a subquery to Query filter pane. Filter Objects ? These are the objects whose values are used to filter result objects. Filter By Objects ? The object that determines which filter value subquery returns. Operator ? This operator defines the relationship between the filter object and the filter by object. WHERE Condition ? This is used to constraint the list of values of the filter by object. Relationship Operator ? AND, OR SAP Webi - Ranking Data You can rank the unranked data from the database in your report. Database ranking allows you to rank the data at database level so when you run a query, data returned by query is already ranked. Database ranking is done by editing the script generated by query. If your database doesn’t support ranking, then the option to create ranking will not highlight in query panel. Also note that Ranking can’t be created on hierarchical data. Creating Database Ranking First add the objects to Result Objects in Query panel. Select Add Ranking at the top of Query filter pane. Select the ranking dimension and type - top, bottom, top %, and bottom %. You can select the number of records or % of records you want the rank to return in the next box. Drag the ranking dimensions, measures, to based-on box. You can also drag dimensions to provide a calculation context to Ranked by box. You can also add WHERE condition by dragging a dimension to the bottom of ranking. Click Run Query. SAP Webi - Working with Reports Webi Report can contain hierarchical and non-hierarchical data according to data source used to create the report. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical data works in different way in the report. A non-hierarchical data contains no parent-child relationship. Hierarchical data contains parent-child relationship between objects and you can use them to analyze and navigate data in a report. Working with Non Hierarchical Data Non-hierarchical data is defined as data with no parent-child relationship. A simple example of non-hierarchical data is Dimension. A non-hierarchical data can be analyzed using various parameters like sorts, filters, etc. Example ? Customer, Product Working with Hierarchical Data Hierarchical data is defined as data with Parent-child relationship and you can analyze the data at different levels of hierarchy. All the measures that are associated with hierarchical data are aggregated as per object level in hierarchy. Example ? Consider a Geography hierarchy; you have Country India and State defined as Delhi. Now if you use this geographical hierarchy in report and want to analyze Number of Units sold at each level for different categories, then hierarchies allow you to use Aggregation at country level and if you drill down to state level, for each state too. Hierarchical Data in Tables Hierarchical data is presented in columns in hierarchical tables. Below table shows the hierarchal data in parent-child relation and aggregated on Quantity sold as measure. India 1200 Delhi 600 Kerala 200 Haryana 400 If you see the above table, the number of units sold for corresponding country India is 1200 and corresponding value at each hierarchy level is also shown. Organizing Data with Sections, Breaks, Sorts You can use sections to divide the information into smaller part for better analysis. Section allows business managers to analyze the data in a more effective manner. Example ? You are an area manager in a multinational company and you have received Sales report showing total revenue for each city and quarter as shown in the following table for the year 2015 ? City Quarter Total Revenue (USD) Delhi Q1 50000 Delhi Q2 40000 Bangalore Q1 30000 Bangalore Q2 40000 Mumbai Q1 50000 Mumbai Q2 40000 Now if you want to apply Section on Quarter column, you can compare the Total Revenue in each city compared on the basis of Quarter. Q1 Delhi 50000 Bangalore 30000 Mumbai 50000 Q2 Delhi 40000 Bangalore 40000 Mumbai 40000 Creating a Section from a Column To create a section on a column, Select the data and column, right-click on the column and select set as Section. Creating a Section from a Dimension To create a section from a Dimension, Go to Report Elements ? Section ? Insert Section. Click on the report area where you want to insert a Section. Choose the Dimension on which Section has to be created. Creating Sections from Hierarchy You can also create Section on Hierarchies in the report. When a section is created on a hierarchy, each member of hierarchy becomes a section header. Let us understand this with the help of an Example ? If you create a section on Customer Geography, you will get the following report. By expanding the Section header, you will get the following report. Removing or Hiding a Section To delete a Section, right-click on the section Select ? Delete. If you select ‘Cell Only’, it will delete ‘Section Cell’ only and if you select ‘Cell and Section’, it will remove ‘Section and Cell’ both. To Hide Sections ? Select Section. Go to Report Elements ?

SAP Webi - Drill Options in Reports The drill option is used to analyze data at different levels. With drilling you can go to the next levels to analyze data in tables, charts, and sections. You can also specify how drill options will make changes to reports when you perform drilling in Webi. Setting drill options depends on the Web Intelligence interface used. BI Launchpad Webi Rich Client Setting Drill Option Note that to use drill option, you should have hierarchy defined at Universe level. Once you have hierarchy at Universe, you can add that object to Result objects in Query panel. Once you run the query, the object will be added to the list of available objects in a Webi document. Drill allows you to move to level up or level down as per the hierarchy in Universe. To set drill option in a Webi report, go to Analysis tab ? Interact ? Drill ? Start Drill. Once you start drill, you can move to the next levels or end drill using the option in the same tab. Example ? Drill on 2015 - the results displayed on the drilled table are Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 for the year 2015. This means that the quarterly values you drilled are filtered by 2015. You can also take a snapshot of Drill result in a separate report. Use the snapshot option to add a new report with drilled data. SAP Webi - Sharing Reports You can publish a Webi content outside Webi documents by publishing report elements like charts and tables as web services. This is called BI services. Publishing as Web Services To publish a Webi document as web services, open the report in Design mode. You can use Publish Content Wizard to publish Webi document. The report should be saved in BI repository to publish as web services. Select the Report Element you want to publish, right-click and click ‘Publish as Web Service’. This will open the Publish Content Wizard ? Click ‘Next’. Publishing Prompts For web services, you should reproduce prompts multiple times to produce different responses. Select the prompts you want to Publish and click ‘Next’. If you don’t select any prompts for publishing, web services uses prompt value that was supplied when the document was last refreshed. Defining Web Services Before publishing a block as a web service, you use the ‘Define Published Content’ screen in the publish content wizard to name the table, make filters available on the block data, and select the server where the block will be published. Save and Publish as Web Services You use the ‘Publish new content’ or ‘Re-publish Existing Content as Web Service’ screen in the Publish Content wizard to save and publish the web service to a host server. To re-publish an existing web service, select the web service, click ‘Publish’. To publish a new web service, select the folder where you want to publish the content and click ‘Create to display the Publish Web Service’ dialog box.

Click Ok and it will save and publish the web service. Choose the web service where you want to publish ? Click Finish. SAP Webi - Merge Dimension This option allows you to merge the data from different data sources. Assume that you have created Query 1 and Query 2 in Query Panel. When you combine both the queries in a single Webi report, objects from both the queries are shown in the list of available objects. Select the unique object from both the queries and click Ok as shown in the following screenshot. It will create a Merge Dimension under the list of available objects. It allows you to synch both the queries and you can add the objects from both the queries in a single report. Sometimes it doesn’t allow you to add objects in the report from either of the queries because of sync issues. In such a case, you can create a new variable for that object. Enter the variable name, qualification as “Detail” and it will add a new field ‘Associate Dimension’. In Associate dimension, select the unique object from the same query. In the Formula tab, select the object from the list of available objects for which you want to create a new variable and click ‘Validate’. Once the variable is created for that object, you can drag that object to the report. Previous Page Print Next Page   Advertisements Write for us FAQ's Helping Contact © Copyright 2017.
