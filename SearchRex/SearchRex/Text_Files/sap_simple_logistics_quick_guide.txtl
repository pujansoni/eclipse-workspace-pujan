ERP Model vs S/4 HANA Data Model To manage large volumes of data, SAP has provided next generation Business Suite S/4 HANA, which uses computing power of HANA to process huge amounts of data at very high speed. SAP S/4 HANA is not a successor of SAP ERP solution and represents a separate product line. SAP ERP solution is a separate product from SAP. With new S/4 HANA Data Model, you can achieve the following benefits over ERP Data Model ? In new S/4 HANA Data Model, it drops all aggregate fields and history tables (in total 24 tables). In the new model, there is no need to perform updates on aggregation tables. Open for new stock types. High speed evaluations. With the recent business development, there has been exponential growth of information - social media, big data, and mobile. In the next 2 years, there will be growth in adaption of business networks. By 2020, there will be 9 billion mobile users worldwide and this will only increase with time. SAP S/4 HANA Business Suite ? Key Features Following are some of the key features of SAP S/4 HANA Business Suite ? SAP S/4 HANA is designed based on new Fiori user experience which provides a role-based integrated user experience. S/4 HANA can be connected to different applications in real time to provide realtime data processing and analysis. S/4 HANA runs on in-memory HANA database to provide simplifications - no indexes, no aggregates, and no redundancies. SAP S/4 HANA provides a choice of deployment - On-Premise, Cloud, and Hybrid. S/4 HANA provides new architecture and data models. Customers can use the customization even after migration of the system. Migration of SAP Business Suite to S/4 HANA is done via implementation package in the form of SAP Simple Finance and Simple Logistics, and many more. With SAP S/4HANA, SAP is providing a new product and a next generation of business applications – simple enterprise software for Big Data and is designed to help you run simple in the digital economy. In the following image, you can see different sub-modules available with SAP S/4 HANA Business Suite. SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management has been designed by reintegrating portions of SAP CRM, SRM, and SCM into this solution. SAP S/4HANA Enterprise Management is available on-premise and in the cloud. It depends on different licensing/subscription models. SAP S/4 HANA solution can be a Cloud solution or you can also implement it as On-Premise system like SAP ERP. SAP Simple Logistics - Main Components In today’s business, it is one of the toughest challenges to meet the inventory requirements as per customer demands. Also, with the development of new technologies, the expectations have increased. Inventory Management With the use of S/4 HANA, an improvement in Inventory Management is observed with the creation of one document table (MATDOC). In the above image, you can see a simplified inventory management data model that led to the creation of Material document table MATDOC. Following changes are implemented with this approach ? No need of saving aggregated tables, on fly aggregation No joining is required with merging header and item level Corrected Material Master Data Table Material Valuation In SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, following material valuation methods are supported ? Standard Price Moving Avg. Price Actual Costing You have the clear separation of master data from transactional data. S/4HANA data model includes only 4 tables instead of multiple tables. You observe reduction of memory footprint and data footprint. Reporting is not only based on material ledger tables and that contains data only related to material. No information is provided related to financial dimensions. The new reporting based on S/4 HANA data model includes both financial and material data. Material Requirements Planning Run and Analysis Using SAP S/4 HANA, material requirement planning shows an overview of the innovations with performance improvement in MRP run. All the material flow is analyzed in real time and quickly identifies any disruptions in material flow and the impact of these issues in Material Requirement Planning Analysis. Following benefits can be achieved using the new support model ? Scenario dependent and 10 times faster. Support for in-house production and delivery schedules. Classic mode for capacity planning and discontinuation. MRP run on any personal device. Adoptable and personalization. With SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, you can use an exception-based working mode to detect issues earlier and this approach helps to improve customer satisfaction by using the Sales Order Fulfillment cockpit. SAP Simple Logistics - Simplification Item In SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management, you can create a simplification list for better management and estimation. Using the Simplification list, it defines the functional capabilities to the individual transactions. A Simplification list contains a list of simplification items, which tells about the business and technical impact. Simplification item has a simplification category and provides information about potential impacts for the customer. Based on the Simplification Item custom code, check analysis can be executed. In SAP S/4 HANA, there is a change in relationship between Bills of Material, Routings, and Production Version. You can combine Bills of Material and routing into one entity and hence it streamlines the revision process. In SAP ERP Business Suite, product master material number field length is 18, which has been increased to 40 characters. Few of MRP fields have been removed like MRP view fields of item master. In ERP system, the vendor master and the customer master are commonly used; however, SAP S/4 HANA approach is based on SAP Business Partner screening to centrally manage master data for business partners, customers, and vendors. Business Partner provides a single point of entry to create, edit, and display master data for business partners, customers, and vendors. Extended Material Number Functionality Activation In S/4 HANA system, if you want to use a material number with 40 characters, following feature has to be activated in the system. The following settings are required ? Activation of the Extended Material Number Functionality Navigate to SPRO ? IMG ? Cross Application Components ? General Application Functions ? Field length Extension ? Activate extended fields or use Transaction: FLETS Changing the Material Number Format Transaction OMSL allows customer-specific settings regarding the material number field length. You can make the settings that needs to be adapted to allow a field length of more than 18 characters or under Material Master Basic Settings. Key Points About Simplification List In SAP S/4 HANA, you can integrate simplification list with custom code check tool and this tool is used to pull a detailed report where custom code doesn’t meet the requirement and scope of S/4 HANA system. Using Simplification List, you need to identify the areas for which you have to take actions and to create an overall conversion project plan. In the simplification list, you can have a simplification item that contains categories of Information. Simplification Categories You can categorize simplification items into the following types ? SAP HANA In-memory Capabilities Simplification items are configured to optimize the use of SAP HANA in-memory capabilities. Consolidation of Existing Functionalities The functionality which is same in core and optimized solution w.r.t business processes and user perspective remains the same. No Functional Equivalent SAP S/4 HANA is not a successor of SAP ERP Business suite. The functional equality may not exist for both systems. In SAP S/4 HANA system, following transactions are not available ? FD01, FD02, FD03, FD05, FD06, FD0 FK01, FK02, FK03, FK05, FK06, FK08 MAP1, MAP2, MAP3 MK01, MK02, MK03, MK05, MK06, MK12, MK18, MK19 VAP1, VAP2, VAP3 VD01, VD02, VD03, VD05, VD06 XD01, XD02, XD03, XD05, XD06, XD07 XK01, XK02, XK03, XK05, XK06, XK07 SAP Simple Logistics - Business Partner SAP Business Partner Screening for SAP S/4 HANA is used to centrally manage master data for business partners, customers, and vendors. With the current development, it is a single point of entry to create, edit, and display master data for business partners, customers, and vendors. You can open the user interface for SAP S/4 HANA Cloud and On-premise solution using Transaction BP. All the transactions in Customer/Vendor in ERP Business Suite are redirected to Business Partner Transaction. The following transactions - XD01, XD02, XD03 or VD0I, VD02, VD03 or XK0I, XK02, XK03 or MK01, MK02, MK03 are not available. When you call these transactions they are redirected to BP Transaction. In Financial Supply Chain Management, BP Transaction is not new and is used to manage credit management, collections, and other functions. Business Partner Application allows you to create, maintain, and manage business partners. You can also use this to perform integration with other functions and data exchange. Note ? SAP Business Partner Screening for SAP S/4HANA is not mandatory for SAP Simple Finance On-premise edition 1503. There are various search functions that you can perform to search for business partners in the standard system. Following search functions can be used in Business Partner ? You can perform the following search in Business Partner functions ? Addresses BUPA_ALL_CUSTOMER BUPA_ALL_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER BUPA_ALL_VENDOR External Number Name Number Search Term You can select “Number” and click the Start button. You can see a list of all Business Partners in the system. The description of Business Partner is also displayed. To open any Business Partner, you have to double-click the Business Partner number. As shown in the following screenshot, you have the option to create a Person, Group, or an Organization. You can also maintain Relationship between objects as shown in the following screenshot. SAP Simple Logistics - MIGO In SAP ERP Business Suite, you have MB transactions which are used to maintain and display goods movement in the system. These MB transactions are replaced by single screen generalized transaction called MIGO. Following points should be noted about MB transactions ? These MB transactions - MB01, MB02, MB03, MB04, MB05, MBOA, MB11, MB1A, MB1B, MB1C, MB31. MBNL, MBRL, MBSF, MBSL, MBST, and MBSU has been removed. Transaction - MMBE_OLD has been replaced by transaction MMBE. You can also use a Fiori App with name Stock Overflow. Above mentioned MB transactions can’t be used in customer coding. These transaction codes still exist in the system. However, when they are called from SAP Easy access it results in an error message. These transactions will be discontinued soon. Hence, customer codes using these transactions should be replaced using functional module BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE. Transaction Elimination/Dead Code In SAP S/4 HANA, few of the transactions (Ex: ME21) have not been removed yet and few others are redirecting to a new transaction, VK01 is pointing to BP and MB03 is redirecting to MIGO or throwing error messages that these transactions are no longer available. Note? Codebase for these transactions still exists in the system and has not been eliminated so you can have a dead code in my system. You can select from the different options in the dropdown list. Check Simplification List To check the simplification list, login to SAP S/4 HANA Enterprise Management backend system. Run an obsolete transaction - MB1C. You can see a message that this transaction is obsolete and see SAP Note #. Try to run transaction MK03 – and this will display the supplier (Current). Enter the vendor and purchasing organization for all data. You will be redirected to transaction BP, as transaction MK03 is obsolete. Let us see how to check the mandatory production versions in the material master of your material. Navigate to SAP Menu ? Logistics ? Production ? Master Data ? Material Master ? Material ?

SAP Simple Logistics - Fiori UX SAP Fiori UX stands for Fiori User Experience of SAP S/4 HANA environment for end users. The term UI is different from UX in the manner that UI stands for user interface which defines the interface between the user and the device. User Experience tries to create a positive experience for the user. SAP Fiori Launchpad is a role-based UI client to access Fiori apps side by side. SAP Fiori Launchpad contains two types of user interface clients - Enterprise Portal and NetWeaver Business Client. UI Theme Designer can be used for customization of Fiori Launchpad. SAP Fiori Application consists of three types of apps ? Transactional Apps Analytical Apps Fact Sheets Transactional Apps Transactional Apps run best on SAP HANA database but can be deployed with any database with acceptable performance. These apps allow the user to run simple SAP transactions on the mobile devices as well as desktop or laptops. Fact Sheets Fact sheets are used to drill the key information and contextual information in business operations. In SAP Fiori tiles, you can drill down to further details. Fact sheets also allow you to navigate to Transactional apps to run SAP transactions. A few fact sheets also provide an integration option of geographical maps. Fact sheets only run on SAP HANA database and require an ABAP stack. They cannot be ported to SAP HANA Live tier-2 architecture. Analytical Apps Analytical apps are used to provide role-based real-time information about the business operations. Analytical apps integrate the power of SAP HANA with SAP business suite. It provides real-time information from large volume of data in front-end web browser. Using analytical apps, you can closely monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). You can perform complex aggregations and calculations of your business operations and react immediately as per the changes in the market condition.

SAP Simple Logistics - Deployment Types SAP S/4 HANA provides various deployment models such as On Premise, Cloud and Hybrid solution. When you deploy S/4 HANA system in the cloud deployment scenario, data replication is performed using the same mechanisms that is used in on-premise installations - SLT. To perform data replication via SLT, SLT portions will have to be available on both the sending (On-premise) and the receiving system (Cloud). Non-SAP reporting and analytics and additional SAP Simple Finance or partner products need to be connected to the cloud instance or be made available within the cloud installation as required. On-Premise Solution In On-premise deployment model, the customer purchases software and hardware; the operations are managed by the customer itself. All the deployment, implementation and maintenance tasks are performed by the customer. Any new software extensions are handled by on-premise support team. Cloud Solution In this deployment, hardware and software is provided by the cloud solution provider and it is rented to the customer. The cloud service provider is responsible for performing all the updates, extensions, and new implementations. Hybrid Solution In this deployment scenario, some part of the software is run by the client on-premise server owned by the client, and additional solution is provided by the client provider. You need to perform an integration between on-premise and cloud environment for better service. Types of Users in SAP S/4 HANA You can have different user types in S/4 HANA system to meet the business requirement. In every company, you have three basic user types ? Occasional ? These user types occasionally use the system and need simple and easy-to-use applications. Expert ? This user type is a fully trained SAP user who knows the system effectively and uses multiple systems and different UIs. Developer ? These users are responsible for adaption and extension of existing applications. These users have to access several applications with different user interfaces. SAP Simple Logistics - Supply Chain Planning In S/4 HANA system, Supply Chain Management process is divided into different steps, out of which few steps are executed by S/4 HANA components and others by SCM component. SAP S/4 HANA and SCM system is integrated together for planning and Core Interface is used for integration. Following processes can be performed by using the components in Supply Chain Management ? Demand Planning (DP) Supply Network Planning (SNP) Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling (PP/DS) Global Available-to-Promise (ATP) Check Transport Planning/Vehicle Scheduling (TP/VS) Demand Planning You can use demand planning to plan future demand for specific customers, regions, or sales organizations. Demand planning allows you to forecast future demands and you can create both quantity-based and value-based plans. You define the planning level using characteristics in the system. All the planning data in demand planning is stored in the form of key figures and it contains a numerical value. Using time characteristics, you can view, plan, and store the data. Historical data is imported to SAP NetWeaver BW system of SCM with the use of BW extractors. Various mathematical methods can be used to analyze historical data for demand planning. Moving average Constant model Trend model Seasonal model Exponential smoothing In analyzing historical data, you can use various constant models for products with historical data that changes little over time. In Demand Planning, seasonal models are used for seasonal products. As per requirement, there can be different seasonal products - candles, ice creams, etc. In the above image, you can see the demand planning process flow. The Sales Order details provide the basis for forecasting future demands. With the forecast result, the demand plan is released as Planned Independent Requirement (PIR). Integrated Business Planning SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) is a real-time integrated planning solution based on SAP HANA. It provides integrated, unified planning across sales and operation, demand and inventory with analytical dashboard for monitoring. IBP is a new user experience which provides the following solutions ? IBP for Sales and Operation IBP for Demand IBP for Inventory IBP for Supply IBP for Response (Planned) To meet future demand, SAP Integrated Business Planning is powered by SAP HANA inmemory and is used to combine the capability of sales and operation, demand, supply planning, and inventory optimization.

SAP Simple Logistics - MRP Procedures In MRP Procedure, you define MRP type in material master. MRP type determines how the material is planned. MRP is performed based on the present and future sales figures, and planned and exact requirement quantities calculate net requirement calculations. Following MRP types are available ? Manual reorder point planning Automatic reorder point planning Forecast-based planning Material requirements planning with forecasts for unplanned consumption Master Production Scheduling (MPS) Consumption-based planning is based on historical consumption values and either uses forecasting or statistical procedures to determine future requirements or just triggers procurement, if the material stock gets low. For MRP material, normally high value A parts are considered, and the quantity and the desired delivery are the main interest areas. You use Consumption based planning for less critical low value parts B and C. Manual reorder point planning is the most common type of consumption based planning and involves minimal administrative work to perform this planning. In this planning, the system sets a manually entered reorder point and at the time of planning run it only checks whether the stock has fallen below this reorder point. When the stock is less than this manually entered reorder point, the system triggers procurement to be performed for a fixed lot size. Following MRP Procedures are supported in consumption based planning ? Reorder Point Planning Forecast-Based Planning Time-Phased Planning To perform MRP, you have to navigate to Logistics ? Materials Management ? Material Requirements Planning ? MRP. Master Production Scheduling Procedure Master Production Scheduling component under MRP is used to flag the materials which affects the company profits and also takes the critical resources. MPS is executed in a similar manner as Material Requirement Planning. MPS is useful to reduce the storage cost and to increase the planning stability. To work with MPS component, you require MRP components and also other components which are required in MRP run. Single Item, Single Level Planning Single Item, Single Level planning involves planning of only one individual material and BOM is not exploded so only the level directly below the material is planned. To perform single item, single level planning you need to navigate to MRP run and under Planning ? Single Item Single Level Planning. This opens the first screen of single item, single level planning as shown in the above screenshot. In the next window, you have to enter the material number, for which you want to carry out single-item planning, and also the plant or planning area, in which you want to plan. Enter the MRP Control parameters for the planning run. If you want to save the parameters set in the initial screen, for the following planning, select Setting option at the top ? Save. Note that single item single level planning is carried out for material selected. When you select Display results before they are saved, it is possible to make changes before it is saved to the database. SAP Simple Logistics - MRP Key Features Material Requirement Planning defines the techniques based on master production schedule and information from inventory records to determine the requirement and scheduling of each material item. A Material Requirement Planning system helps ? To create schedules identifying specific parts required to produce end items in planning. To define the exact number of items required. To define the dates when orders for those materials should be released, as per lead time. MRP run is based on Master Production Schedule (MPS) that defines the production volume of the finished products. The second input to run MRP is Bill of Materials (BOM) which is a detailed item wise requirement document. Output of MRP Run The result of a MRP run could be a work order to be released for in-house production of items. The results of MRP run could be Purchase Orders, which is sent to outside suppliers. Rescheduling Notices - issued for items that are no longer needed. Benefits of MRP Run Following are the benefits of MRP run ? Improved inventory planning and scheduling. Faster response as per market changes. Reduced inventory levels without reducing the customer service. Increased customer satisfaction and service. Fast performance by up to factor 10/Memory footprint reduction by factor 5 System analyzes and performs Impact Analysis of the entire material flow in real time and identifies disruptions in the material flow. Can be run on any device. You can perform central business functions such as procurement, in-house production, delivery schedules, configure products, etc. You can perform MRP run for individual forecast or total forecast. SAP Simple Logistics - Procurement Types Procurement Type is used to determine whether a material is procured in-house or it can be procured externally, i.e. a planned order or a purchase order needs to be created. The type of procurement completely depends on the material type. When the procurement type supports both in-house production and external procurement, material requirement planning starts with in-house production. As per the procurement type, the master data settings and MRP parameters, the receipts (usually planned orders or purchase requisitions) are scheduled. Restrictions due to overloads are left out of consideration, the procurement type defines the type of procurement elements. Depending on the procurement, scheduling is applied. Special Procurement Type is used to define how procurement has to be carried out. In consumption based planning, special procurement type stock transfer from plant to plant at the plant level can be defined. Material Requirement Planning is normally performed at the plant level. You can also exclude storage location stock from the plant’s MRP run. With the use of storage location MRP, you can define the following special procurement types ? Production in an alternative plant Stock transfer from an alternative plant External procurement Consignment SAP Simple Logistics - Execute MRP Live Material Requirement Planning defines techniques based on master production schedule and information from inventory records to determine the requirement and scheduling of each material item.
