This is used to calculate the remuneration for each employee with respect to the work performed by them. SAP Payroll not only consists of remuneration part, but also the other benefits that the organization has to provide for the employee welfare according to different company laws in any country. These commonly include ? Labor Law Benefits Law Contribution Law Tax Law Information Law Reporting Law Statistics Law A SAP Payroll System manages the gross and net pay, which also includes the payments and deductions calculated while processing payroll for an employee. The system calculates the payment and all deductions while processing remuneration using different wage types. Once the payroll processing is done, the system carries out different subsequent activities. For example ? You can generate various lists related to remuneration and deductions performed in the system. Integration with Other Modules for Payroll Processing SAP Payroll module is easily integrated with ? Personnel Administration Time Management Incentive and Wages Finance and Accounting Personnel Administration is used to get the master data and other payroll related information. By using Time Management, you can get the time related data to calculate the remuneration and for payroll run. Incentive and Wages data is used to calculate the incentive wages component in the payroll. Wage type defines the daily payroll for each employee and incentive defines the other extra benefits that should be paid to an employee. Expense Payable for payroll is posted to cost center using integration with SAP Finance and Accounting module. You can assign the cost to cost centers in Finance and Accounting module. Here you can also manage the expense for payroll processing of the third party vendors. Basics – Payroll Payroll is based on the payroll driver that varies with each country and region. The payroll driver considers the administrative and legal regulations of the country while defining the payroll. While running a payroll, the payroll driver refers to its corresponding payroll schema, which contains a number of different functions. Each function consists of import data function from internal tables and payroll related files. The steps in Payroll processing ? A payroll system gets the payroll related data from the system. In case of off-cycle payroll, the system deletes the internal table and imports the last payroll result. The gross wage, shift schedule, and compensation along with the valuation bases are calculated in the system and the master data relevant to this payroll is added in the calculation. Next is to calculate the partial period factors, salary elements, and to calculate the gross results. Finally, in the last process system calculates the net remuneration and performs the accounting in case there is any change in the master data from a previously processed payroll. Once this payroll run is completed, the results are transferred to Finance Accounting and evaluation. Then the posting is done for the corresponding cost centers. Payroll Driver Payroll driver is used to run the payroll and their structure is based on that particular country’s laws, as each country has a specific payroll driver. Following are a couple of drivers with their technical names ? RPCALCx0 ? Here, x represents the country specific code, like ‘D’ for Germany and F for France, etc. HxxCALC0 ? Here, xx represents the ISO code for country, like ID for Indonesia. Payroll Schema This represents the calculation rules used by the payroll driver. In SAP Payroll system, you have country-specific schemas X000 where X represents the country indicator. The Schema structure consists of the following components ? Initialization Step 1 ? Includes updating the database Importing the Infotypes Calculating gross pay Step 2 ? Processing of time data from time management Off cycle payroll run Payroll accounting of last processed payroll Calculating time related data and calculating gross amount for each employee Performing factors Calculating Net pay Step 3 ? Calculating the net remuneration Performing the bank transfers Payroll – Background Operation It is also possible to automate the payroll run partially or fully and schedule it to run in the background. SAP recommends a few tasks to be run in the background for better performance. For example ? Payroll can be run in the night and you can check the results the next morning. How to Schedule Payroll in Background? Go to System ? Service ? Jobs ? Define Job or SM36 You can define the job here to let the payroll run to process in the background. These background jobs are processed using a Computing Center Management System (CCMS) in the SAP system. The CCMS can be used to perform the following functions. The configuration and monitoring of this background processing system. Managing and scheduling background jobs in the system. How to Schedule a Background Job? To schedule a background job, enter the Job Name. Enter the job class that defines the priority of the job. You can define three types of priorities ? Class A - High Class B - Medium Class C - Low You can also define the system for load balancing in the target filed. If you want the system to select the server automatically for load balancing purpose, you can leave this option blank. If you want the spool request generated from this job to be sent to someone using email, you can mention the same in the Spool list recipient. To define a start condition, click on the Start condition tab, there are various options that you can use to define the Start condition. If you want to create a periodic job, check the box at the bottom left side of the screen as shown in the following screenshot. Define the steps of the job by clicking the Step tab. You can specify the ABAP Program, external command or any external program to be used for each step. The next step is to save the job to submit to background processing system. Note ? You have to release a job to make it run. No job even those scheduled for immediate processing, can run without first being released. SAP Payroll - Off-Cycle Activities Off-Cycle activities are carried out to process payroll for an employee on any day unlike payroll run that is a periodic activity and schedule to run at specific time interval. In order to perform Off-Cycle activities, you should define an Off-Cycle activity section in customizing for payroll. Off-Cycle consists of the following areas ? Off-Cycle Workbench It provides a uniform user interface for all the Off-Cycle activities. You can perform the following functions in an Off-Cycle workbench ? To make a bonus payment to an employee on a special occasion like a marriage gift, new born baby, etc. To perform an immediate correction run. For example ? Consider where employee master data got modified. To pay an absence like a leave in advance. To process the payments that are added to Payroll Results Adjustment under Infotype 0221. Consider a case where the payment was made but not received by an employee. To perform a replacement, you can use Off-Cycle workbench. If you want to reverse a payroll result. Payroll History This is one of the key components that allows you to check the previous payroll run results for an employee within an Off-Cycle workbench. In the Off-Cycle workbench, go to History tab to display an extract from the payroll which contains all the necessary information of an employee payroll. It also shows details of all the payments that are replaced with a check along with any payroll’s which are reversed are also mentioned here. If you want to check any further details on an employee payroll, you can check the remuneration statement for the employee for a specific payroll period. You can also check the following details about the payment made in the History tab under workbench ? For reverse payment you can check the reason for reversal and person who has carried out reversal payment. To check the replace payment details, you can find which payments are replaced and by which check number. Details of check number, bank name, etc. Note that to view the remuneration statement of a payroll ? select the result and choose ? Remuneration Statement. Off-Cycle Subsequent Processing This is used to further process the Off-Cycle payroll results, a payment reversal or repayment, etc. When a bonus payment is made using a workbench, a replaced or reverse payroll, remuneration statement should be generated and results from payroll run should be posted to Accounting. All the details related to Off-Cycle payroll, reverse payment or repayment is stored in table T52OCG and is available in the report H99LT52OCG and this report is available in Off-Cycle menu. Report for Batch Subsequent Processing Subsequent processing is performed by running one or more batch reports and to ensure that subsequent processing is performed in the correct sequence. You should schedule the report for a Batch Subsequent Processing in the international standard system as regular background jobs. With scheduling report that subsequent processing is conducted regularly and on time. Process Model Process model is used to define a subsequent program and order in which they run. When you select a report for Batch Subsequent Processing, you also have to define the process model report that should be used. Off–Cycle subsequent processing, it is possible to schedule the batch report in background job with process model or you can also call it in a workbench menu and run it from there. According to the function executed in an Off-Cycle workbench, different activities are performed. For example ? Consider replacing a payment. Function Activities Replacing a Payment Runs Preliminary Program Data Medium Exchange Indicates each payment replacement with a key composed of program run date and the indicator feature CYYYP. Enters the details in the indicator table for off-cycle batch processing Runs the batch report for subsequent processing of check replacement as a background job at the time that you have scheduled for the regular processing of the report Reads indicator table Runs the process model that you have specified in the report variant Prints new checks SAP Payroll - Infotypes To maintain a master data in SAP system, there are different Infotypes defined in SAP system for Personnel Administration and payroll.

Reporting Bases Payroll system consists of Date Specifications and monitoring of tasks Infotypes. Using monitoring of task, you can set automatic monitoring of tasks for HR activities and system suggest a date when you want to be reminded of the stored tasks. Date Specifications This is stored in Infotype 0041 and date type defines the type of information. You can create series of reports on specific date type. You can use this Infotype to run Payroll and also to maintain leave. In a standard payroll system, it contains 12 combinations of date type and date and to add more date specification for an employee at the same time, you can use time constraint 3. Monitoring of Tasks You can also create an automatic monitoring of all HR related tasks that includes follow up activities to be performed and it is maintained in Infotype 0019. System suggests a date according to task type on which you will be reminded and this allows you to perform follow up activities as per the required schedule. The reminder date in the system is used to determine when you want to be reminded for a task type. Reminder date can be defined based on this criteria ? When you select a task type, if the operator indicator has a blank or negative (-) value then reminder should be set before the task data. If the Operator indicator has a positive (+) value, reminder date shouldn’t be before the task date. Note ? Payroll system also suggests a reminder date for each task independent of task type and you can change this at any point of time. Following are a few task types that can be added under monitoring ? Temporary contract Expiry of inactive contract Expiry of temporary contract Next appraisal Pay scale jump End of maternity protection End of maternity leave Start of maternity protection Training period Dismissal protection Personal interview Vaccination date Follow-up medical Submit SI statement Work permit Work permit expires End of leave of absence Expiry of probation Employee Qualification This contains Infotype related to employee’s previous/other work experience, education and training and qualification.

Commercial power of attorney General commercial power of attorney Power of attorney to perform banking transactions SAP Payroll - Pay Scale Grouping Pay scale grouping for allowances is performed to add similar type of employees in a group and similar characteristics are applied on each group. This is used to determine: compensation structure as per grouping, payroll processing procedure, and the value of compensation for an employee. While defining the payroll processing, grouping is the first step that is performed. Wage type can’t be defined till you define the pay scale grouping for allowances. Pay scale grouping for allowances is defined based on few parameters ? Pay scale area Pay scale type Pay scale group Pay scale level Employee Subgrouping for Collective Agreement Processing As an example, consider a company with offices in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. Now the employee location where he is located affects the compensation to a certain level. In this case, it is possible to assign the different cities to pay scale area and hence pay scale area becomes a key pay parameter to create pay scale grouping for allowances. In a similar way you can define other pay scale parameters depends on various factors. In SAP Easy access menu ? SPRO ? IMG ? Personnel Management ? Personnel Administration ? Payroll data ? Basic Pay ? Define EE Subgroup Grouping for PCR and Coll.Agrmt.Prov. It will show you the list of EE group, the EE group name and different fields associated with it. If you want to change it, this can be done here. Pay Scale Grouping for Allowances is not define in any of the Infotypes. You can’t put an employee directly to a pay scale grouping for allowances. When you define five different pay parameters, an employee is directly assigned to a pay scale grouping for allowances. By entering an Employee Group and Employee Subgroup in Organizational Assignment Infotype (0001) and pay scale area, pay scale type, pay scale group, pay scale level in the Basic Pay Infotype (0008), it adds the employee to a pay scale grouping for allowances automatically. So, the pay scale grouping is defined as an assignment of the pay parameters. Go to SPRO ? IMG ? Payroll ? Payroll: India ? Assign Pay scale grouping for allowances. In the next window that comes up, you can see the associated pay parameters to pay scale grouping. PS Area PS Type PS Group PS Level Pay Scale grouping for allowances can decide the following objects in Payroll ? Wage types Basic salary and increments Dearness Allowance Housing and Car & Conveyance Recurring allowances and deductions Reimbursements, Allowances and Perks Leave Travel Allowance Gratuity Superannuation Long Term Reimbursements Rounding off Recovery Provident Fund SAP Payroll - Mid-Year Go Live Mid-Year Go Live data is used in countries where payroll is implemented in the middle of financial year. This is used for transferring legacy payroll data to the SAP System and also for creating payroll results from the transferred legacy data. For Example ? You can consider a case for India where income tax assessment year is performed from 1st April – 31st March. Now to implement SAP Payroll India in the middle of a Financial Year, there is a need to transfer payroll results for those periods of the financial year that lie before that period. Pre-Go-Live This is defined as a period for which the payroll results are available and need to be transferred to the SAP system. Go-Live This period is defined as the term when you process the first productive payroll run. Rehiring This is used to rehire an employee by using the same Personnel number as used in the time of last employment or within same financial year. The action type associated with this is – Reentry into the company. In case of rehiring an employee, if previous records are not delimited, you will have to delimit the previous records and there is a need to create new entries. The following Infotype value needs to be updated for this action type ? Recurring Payments/Deductions (0014) Organizational Assignment (0001) Membership Fees (0057), Example: sports club, Union, etc. Family Member/Dependents (0021) Other Statutory Deductions (0588) Long term reimbursements (0590) Housing (0581), Example ? HRA, Company owned, etc. Running Payroll for Rehiring While running the payroll for a rehired employee, payroll function checks the status of the rehired employee’s employment in the system. If the system is showing the present status as active preceded with withdrawn and active status within same Financial Year, this represents that the employee is rehired. The status of an employee’s employment is maintained in the internal table COCD. To check the previous payroll data for a rehired employee – earning, deductions, and exemptions, this can be checked using the Results Table (RT) and the Cumulative Results Table (CRT). Previous Employment Tax Details The Payroll function INPET is used to process the previous employment tax details. The following wage types are generated ? Wage Type /4V1 to /4V9 ? This is created to maintain details of the employee’s employment in the other company in the same Financial Year. Wage Type /4VA to /4Vg (From internal table 16) ? This is created to maintain employee’s previous employment details in the same company in the same Financial Year. The following components of the employee’s tax is calculated for a rehired employee ? Tax Exemptions on ? House Rent Allowance (HRA) (Metro or non-Metro) Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) Child Education Allowance or Tuition fee Child Hostel Allowance (CHA) The following perquisites are checked before calculating tax ? Company Owned Accommodation Company Paid/Leased Accommodation Loans The Payroll system also checks the below deductions for the employee ? Deductions under section 80 Section 89 relief Professional Tax Labor Welfare Fund (LWF), etc. Employee State Insurance (ESI) EPF Provident Fund and Pension Fund A Split Payroll is run for the following periods – First of the month to one day before the employee is rehired. And from the date of rehiring to the end of the month. When an employee is rehired on any day other than the first, a split payroll is enabled. Go to SPRO ? IMG ? Payroll ? Payroll India ? Basic Settings ? Enable Split Payroll Run. In a new window, you will see the list of all split payroll in the system. To create a new entry, click on the New Entries tab at the top left hand side of the screen. Enter the values: Act. 12 stands for re-entry into the company. In a similar way, you can select the other fields as well. Once you enter all the details, click the save icon at the top left hand side of the screen. An example of rehiring and payroll run ? An employee left a company on May 17, 2015 and was rehired on Nov 25, 2015. In this case, November payroll will be run twice. For the period between Nov 1, 2015 and Nov 24, 2015. For the period between Nov 25, 2015 to Nov 30, 2015. SAP Payroll - Indirect Evaluation Indirect Evaluation is used to calculate payroll for some specific wage types that are defaulted under the Basic Pay Infotype (0008) or Infotype 0014 or 001 (recurring payment/deductions or Additional payments). Note ? While using indirect evaluation, it is also possible to calculate INVAL as numbers instead of using value as amount considering the wage type configured correctly. For example ? You can configure INVAL for an employee to be eligible for 10 liters of petrol each month. This represents INVAL as number. Variants for Indirect Evaluation There are quite a few types of variants for indirect evaluation, which are ? Variant A ? This is used to calculate the wage type value as a fixed amount. Variant B ? This is used to calculate the amount as percentage of the base wage type added to a fixed amount. In this, multiple amounts with same or different percentage of the base wage type, can be calculated for an INVAL wage type. In this case, the amount that will be Indirectly Evaluated will be the sum of all such calculated amounts added to a fixed amount. For example ? Wage type M230, consider the following different INVAL B amounts. 
10% of MB10
30% of M220
Fixed amount of Rs.1000
So in this scenario, wage type M230 will have INVAL amount as sum of a, b and c.
 Variant C ? This is used to calculate the amount as a percentage of a base wage type subject to a maximum limit. More than one such amount, with same or different percentage of the base wage type, can be calculated for an INVAL wage type. In this case, the amount that will be Indirectly Evaluated will be the sum of all such calculated amounts, subject to a maximum limit. For example ? Wage type M230, consider the following different INVAL C amounts. 
15% of MB10
20% of M220
Limit of Rs.4000
In this scenario, INVAL amount for the wage type M230 will be the sum of a, and b 
subject to a maximum of c.
 Variant D ? This is used to calculate the amount as one or any combination of the following INVAL Module variants based on Basic salary slabs. This is used to calculate the fixed amount and the percentage of the basic slab. This is done by first calculating the percentage of a base wage type added to a fixed amount. And then secondly, the percentage of a base wage type which is subject to a maximum limit. SAP Payroll - Gross Part The Gross Part of the Payroll is used to determine an employee’s gross pay as per the contractual requirements and consists of payments and deductions. The Gross Pay consists of different components, which includes ? Basic Pay Dearest Allowance Variation allowance Bonuses Provident fund Gratuity Then there are different deductions that are made as per the employee enrollment. These deductions include company owned apartment (COA), company sponsored day care, and other deductions. All these factors are based on a country’s legal labor rules and determines the gross taxable income of the employee. Wage Types Wage type is one of the key components in payroll processing. Based on the way they store information; wage type can be divided into the following two categories ? Dialogue wage type or Primary wage type Primary wage type is defined as the wage type for which data is entered in an Infotype. The Primary wage types are created by copying the model wage types provided by SAP. There are different types of primary wage types ? Time wage type Time wage type is used to store the time related information. This wage type is used to combine payroll and time management. Time wage type is generated at the time of evaluation and is configured through T510S or using a custom PCR. Dialogue wage type This wage type includes basic pay IT0008, recurring payments and deductions IT0014, and additional payments IT0015. Secondary Wage type or Technical Wage type The secondary wage types are predefined wage types in the SAP system and starts with a ‘/’. These wage types are created during the payroll run. These wage types are system generated and can’t be maintained online. For example ? /559 Bank Transfer Wage Type Elements The key elements of a wage type include ? Amount AMT Rate RTE Number NUM As per the processing type, each element can have one, two or all element values. For example ? The basic pay can have a Rate and a Number, however a bonus pay can only have an amount. Payments The payment includes all the payments given to an employee according to the employment contract and any voluntary payment paid. A payment combines the employee gross remuneration. This gross remuneration is defined as the calculation of social insurance and tax payments and also for the calculation of net remuneration. Payment Structure The payment is defined in terms of the following components in the SAP Payroll system ? Basic Pay ? This component consists of the fixed wage and other salary elements and is paid to the employee for each payroll period. The details are entered in the Basic Pay (0008) Infotype. Recurring Payments and Deductions ? Recurring payments and deductions include components like overtime, leave or other components. This information is maintained in Recurring Payment and deduction Infotype (0014). Additional Payments ? There are many components in the payment section, which are not paid in each payroll period. This information is added to Additional Payments Infotype (0015). Time Management in Payroll Time management is one of the key components in Payroll that is used to calculate the gross salary of the employees. Monetary benefits are determined by work schedule and planned working hours. The time management integration with payroll is used to determine wage types like bonuses for overtime, night/odd hour work allowance, work on holiday, etc. You can also use Time Data Recording and Administration Component Integration with Time Management component to find out time data information for employees and further to determine the time wage types. When you use this time evaluation component Integration with Time Management component, this is used to find time wage types determined by Time Evaluation. Night Shift Compensation/Shift Change Compensation This component is used to ensure that an employee shouldn’t get financial disadvantage, if he/she is working in odd hours or if a shift time is changed for them. For example ? An employee’s planned working time is changed and he is facing a financial disadvantage, he or she is paid on the basis of the original working time – like an employee gets his shift changed from a night shift with night shift bonuses to an early shift. If an employee’s shift time is changed and that employee will be benefited financially, he or she is paid on the basis of the changed working time. Consider an employee whose shift changes from Friday to a Sunday with Sunday bonuses. In this case, a shift change compensation will be listed under the remuneration statement. It is also possible to limit the payment of a shift change compensation for a particular category. Employee Remuneration Information This is used to process the manually calculated wages, bonus or non-standard wage types. Function Required Component Record wage types for work performed and the information on other components in the system Cross-application time sheet This component provides information on payroll with time and person related time wage types. Time wage type is used to perform the financial evaluation of work performed on a payroll. Wage Type Valuation Wage type is one of the key components in payroll processing. Based on the way they store information, they can be defined as Primary and Secondary Wage types. During the payroll run, the primary wage types are provided with the values and secondary wage types are formed at the time of the payroll run. You can check the characteristics of a wage type by going to the following path ? SPRO ? IMG ? Personnel Management ? Personnel Administration ? Info Type ? Wage types ? Wage type catalog ? Wage type characteristics Old and New Processing of Averages With the release of 4.6B, processing of averages has been changed. Processing of averages depends on the country and release and with countries like Argentina, Brazil and a few other, a new processing is released with version 4.5B. At one time, you can only use any of these two versions, if you are using an old version, you can continue to use the same version and there is no need to move to the new version, but the older version is not under development. The technical processing of averages can be configured as shown in the following steps ? SPRO ? IMG ? Payroll ? Payroll India ? Time wage type valuation ? Averages ?

Forming the basis for calculating average values Definition of calculation rules for averages Assignment of calculation rules to wage types To create a new technical processing of average, click on New Entries In a new window, define the different rules as mentioned above and click on the save icon at the top. Incentive Wages: Overview To maintain incentive wages, different accounting processes are defined in standard SAP system. Monthly Wage Calculation for Incentive Wages In this Wage Type, target time for each ticket is calculated using a piecework rate. This is used to calculate the amount for time ticket that the employee is due. This amount consists of ? Basic Monthly Pay ? This defines the gross amount that is paid to the employees irrespective of their performance and it can be paid as a monthly sum or in terms of hourly pay as per their contract. Time Dependent Variable Pay ? This is used to define the pay scale rate that is different from a master pay scale rate for an employee. It is possible that an employee is remunerated at a high rate as compared to a master pay rate for specific activities. You have to enter a higher pay scale into the time ticket. Performance Dependent Variable Pay ? This is used to credit when an employee completes the work in less time than the target time. The different between target time and actual time is mentioned on time ticket. Hourly Wage Calculation for Incentive Wages This is similar to the monthly wage calculation with the only difference that the monthly wage is specified as an hourly wage from the starting, so you don’t need to convert the monthly basic wage into an hourly wage. Incentive Wage Accounting: Tools Personnel calculation schemas ? There are two types of schemas valuation of time tickets for incentive wages ? German Version DIW0 ? this contains special features that are specific to German only. International Version XIW00 ? You can use schema XIW00 to set up your own incentive wage accounting rules as per different countries. As valuation of time tickets vary according to different countries and organizations so there are no country specific accounting schemas in it. Partial Period Remuneration This component is used to check the remuneration when an employee works for a lesser period of time. You can use factoring in the following cases ? When an employee leaves, joins or remains absent for a specific period of time. When there is a change in the basic pay, substitution, work reassignment or change in personal work schedule. To find the correct remuneration for an employee, the remuneration amount is multiplied by a partial period factor which is based on different methods ? Payment method Deduction method PWS method Hybrid method Each Payroll system contains few factoring rules that are needed to determine the partial period factor. These rules can be customized to meet specific requirements in the company. The following Infotypes are calculated for partial period remuneration ? Actions Infotype 0000 Organizational Assignment Infotype 0001 Planned working time Infotype 0007 Basic Pay Infotype 0008 Recurring payments and deductions Infotype 0014 Additional Payments Infotype 0015 Absences Infotype 2001 Substitutions Infotype 2003 Partial Period Factor This factor is used to calculate the partial remuneration. This is defined as a variable value which is calculated using different formulas as per the company and the circumstances. While customizing, partial period factors are defined in a personnel calculation rules for specific situations and assigned to wage types for particular periods. When you multiply the partial period factor by the fixed remuneration amount, this gives you partial period remuneration amount to be paid for a specific period. For example ? Consider an employee who was on an unpaid leave from 3rd February to 29th March, this means that the employee has worked for 2 days in February and 2 days in March considering 20 workdays in Feb and 23 workdays in Mar. Parameter February March Planned working time (SSOLL) 148 172 Absence(SAU) 132 156 Individual period working time (SDIVI) 148 172 General period working time (SDIVP) 167,7 167,7 Now consider reduction using the following different ways ? Partial Period Factor Basic Remuneration Method Calculation formula Remuneration for February Remuneration for March PWS a = (SSOLL-SAU**)/SDIVI 0,108 0,093 Reduced remuneration: b×a 351,22 302,44 Payment a = (SSOLL-SAU**)/SDIVP 0,095 0,095 Reduced remuneration: b×a 308,94 308,94 Deduction a = (SDIVP-SAU**)/SDIVP 0,213 0,070 Reduced remuneration: b×a 692,68 227,64 Now if you use the payment method, the employee receives the same remuneration for both the months. If you use the deduction method, the employee is overpaid in Feb and underpaid in March. If the PWS method is used, the employee receives more salary in Feb as compared to March, however the difference is negligible.
