SAP Sales and Distribution module is a part of SAP Logistics module that manages customer relationship starting from raising a quotation to sales order and billing of the product or service. This module is closely integrated with other modules like SAP Material Management and PP. Key Components in SAP SD The key components in SAP Sales and Distribution module are ? Customer and Vendor Master Data Sales Support Shipping of Material Sales Activities Billing related Transportation of products Credit Management Contract Handling and Management Foreign Trade Information System SAP Sales and Distribution Cycle SAP SD - Organizational Structure SAP provides many components to complete SAP Sales and Distribution organizational structure like Sales Areas, Distribution Channels, Divisions, etc. The SAP SD organization structure majorly consists of two steps ? Creation of Organization elements in SAP system, and second is to link each element as per requirement. On top of this organization structure in the SD module, sales organization is at highest level and is responsible for distribution of goods and services. SAP recommends to keep the number of sales organization in an organizational structure to be minimum. This will help in making the reporting process easy and ideally it should have a single sales organization. The next level is distribution channel, which tells the medium by which the products and services are distributed by an organization to its end users. Division in an organizational structure, which represents a product or service line in a single organization. A sales area is known as entity, which is required to process an order in a company. It comprises of sales organization, distribution channel and a division. In SAP SD organizational structure, each sales organization is assigned to a company code. Then the distribution channel and divisions are assigned to sales organization and all of these comprise to make a sales area. In the first step of an SD organizational structure, sales organization is assigned to a company code and then is to define a distribution channel and then division to a sales organization. The following diagram shows the organizational structure of a Sales and Distribution module ? Material management Material Management is one of the key modules in SAP ERP System and covers the day to day business operations related to inventory and procurement. This module is closely integrated with other modules of R/3 systems like Finance Accounting and Controlling, Sales and Distribution, Quality Management, Product Planning. Integration with Sales and Distribution SD Module Consider an example of creating a sales order in SAP SD, it involves copying the details of items from Material Management. Availability check of the item and price details are also taken from MM, but this can be controlled in the SD module. To create inbound and outbound delivery of goods for a sales order, shipping details, loading point etc. also comes from the Material Master. The item that is placed using a Sales order must be extended to the sales area of an organization to sales order/customer, otherwise it won’t be possible to transact with this material. This confirms that there is a link between SAP SD and MM module, when a sales order is created and fulfilled. Similarly, there are many other links between two modules. Finance and Accounting SAP FI stands for Financial Accounting and it is one of the important modules of SAP ERP. It is used to store the financial data of an organization. SAP FI helps to analyze the financial condition of a company in the market. It can integrate with other SAP modules like SD, PP, SAP MM, SAP SCM etc. For SAP FI-MM, use T-code: OBYC In case of a standard sales order, you create an outbound goods delivery to the customer. Here movement 601 takes place. This movement is configured in MM and movement of goods hit some G/L account in FI. This shows the integration between SAP SD, FI and MM module. Document Flow This shows how a transaction in one system effects the details in other systems of an SAP module. Consider the following transaction ? For SAP FI-MM, use T-code: OBYC Whenever there is a delivery created with reference to a sales order, goods movement takes place in the system. Example In case of a standard sales order in the SD module, you create an outbound goods delivery to the customer. Availability check and retail price of that product is checked in the MM module. Here, movement 601 takes place. This movement is configured in the MM and movement of goods hit some G/L account in FI. Every such movement of goods hits General Ledger account in FI. The accounts posting in FI is done with reference to the billing documents like credit and debit note, invoice etc. created in SD and hence this is the link between SD and FI. This shows the document flow between different modules. Process Chain SD module is closely integrated with other SAP modules. The following tables will give you a brief idea on how SD is linked with other modules ? Sales Order Link Points Module Involved Availability Check MM Credit Check FI Costing CO/MM Tax Determination FI Transfer of Requirements PP/MM Billing Integration Point Module Debit A/R FI/CO Credit Revenue FI/CO Updates G/l (Tax,discounts,surcharges,etc) FI/CO Milestone Billing PS Goods Delivery and Issue of goods Integration Module Availability Check MM Credit Check FI Reduces Stock MM Reduces Inventory FI/CO Reduces Eliminated PP/MM SAP SD - Customer & Material Master Data Master data is one of the key factors in Sales and Distribution module. There are two levels of masters in SD. The first level master includes ? Customer Master Material Master Pricing Conditions While, the second level master is ? Output condition Create a Customer Master Record The customer master data contains the information about business transaction and how transactions are recorded and executed by the system. A Master contains the information about the customers that an organization uses to do business with them.

This module helps organizations to create new sales, tracking of existing sales, and performance as well, which eventually helps in improving the marketing and sales of an organization. This SAP SD Sales support module provides an option of creating an email list of the customers and directly sending mails for new leads. The sales support stores all the data pertaining to the sales and distribution related to customers, products, materials, competitor products, etc. SAP Sales Support Tables VBKA TKSF TVC6 TVC5 SAP Sales Support Transaction Codes VC01 OV4Z VC05 VC00 VOC1 SAP SD - Sales Order Processing There are various modules which are helpful in creating, processing, as well as controlling the sales and distribution operations. These include ? Sales Order Processing Creation of Sales Order with Reference Item Categories Schedule Lines Categories Copy Control Log of Incomplete Items In this chapter, we will discuss how to process sales orders in SAP SD. Sales Order Processing Sales order processing describes a function related to the wholesale part of an organizational business. The most common functions under the sales order processing are ? Availability of the articles purchased. Checking for incomplete data. Checking the status of the sales transaction. Calculation of pricing and taxes. Schedule the deliveries of goods. Printing of documents or e-transfer of documents. All these functions can be configured automatically or manually as per the system configuration. The data from these functions is stored in a sales document and can be changed manually during the processing. A sales document can be a single document or can be part of a series consisting of interrelated documents. Example There is a customer telephone inquiry in the system. Then the customer requests a quotation, which can be created by referring to the same inquiry. Next, assume that the customer places an order on the basis of that quotation and a sales order is created by copying the information from this quotation and if at all there are any modifications that are required. The merchandise is then shipped and the bill is sent to this customer. After the delivery of goods, this customer raises a claim of damaged articles. Then a delivery can be created free of charge with reference to the sales order. All these sales documents ? starting with the inquiry, quotation, raising a sales order, delivery of goods, billing document to customer and the free of charge delivery forms a document flow. The data flow from one document to another removes or decreases the practice of manual processing and helps in simpler problem resolution. SAP SD - Creation of Sales Order A Sales order is a request made by a customer to the company for delivery of some defined quantity of goods or a service in a specific time period. The Structure of a Sales Order An inquiry from a customer consists of one or more items that contains the quantity of a material or service entered in the order. The quantity in a sales order is further divided into business lines and comprises of various subsets and delivering dates. The items mentioned in the Sales order are combined in a hierarchy and allows to differentiate between batches or to use combinations of materials. All the valid conditions on these items are mentioned in item conditions. These conditions for an item can be derived via a full condition and can be valid for the entire sales order.

SAP SD - Item Categories An item category is used to define if an item is suitable for billing or pricing. It defines the additional control functions for a sales document. Example ? A standard item function is totally different from the function of a free of charge item or a text item. As per the sales document type, you can define different types of item categories. If required, you can also modify the existing item categories or can also define new item categories. An item category can be defined on the basis of the following questions ? General Data Control Elements An item refers to a material or a text item? Whether pricing has to be carried out for an item? Are schedule lines allowed for an item? When the item has to be considered as completed? If an item cannot be fully delivered, a message will appear in the system or not? Which partner functions are allowed for an item? Which output is allowed for business transactions? Shipping Data Control Elements Is the volume and weight of an item determined? Whether this Item is relevant for a delivery or not?

SAP SD - Schedule Lines Categories In a sales document, items are divided into one or more schedule lines. These lines vary as per the date and quantity. You can define multiple control elements for these schedule lines. Items with schedule lines are only copied to the SAP system. These schedule lines contain important information like delivery dates and quantity, available inventory, etc. You can define different schedule line categories as per the sales document type and item category. The various control elements related to general data and shipping data are used for categorizing schedule lines. You can also define new schedule lines and the system administrator manages data related to control elements. General Data Control Elements If an availability check is carried out in system? Is it a schedule line for a return item? Whether a customer request is posted to purchase department? Shipping Data Control Elements If a delivery block is set automatically for a defined schedule line? Is the schedule line relevant for delivery? The categorization of schedule line majorly varies as per the item category of a corresponding item and the material requirement planning MRP. This is defined in the material master record. The categories for a schedule line are defined automatically as per their values in the corresponding table. In case if it is required, you can do some manual changes to the values in the sales document, but can’t change all the values. How to Define Schedule Line Categories? It can be defined in the following ways ? You can copy an existing schedule line category and make changes as per the requirement. Changes can be made to the existing schedule line category. Creation of a new schedule line category. Schedule Line Categories in different sales document Inquiry ? No delivery of an item. No availability check. Information purpose. Quotation ? No Delivery.

SAP SD - Copy Control Copy Control is defined as a process in which important transactions in a sales document are copied from one document to other. It consists of routines, which determine the system on how the data is to be copied from a source document to a target document. A SAP system contains a number of these routines and you can also create additional routines to meet the business requirements. To create a new routine, you can use an existing sales document as a reference. How to find Copy Controls in SAP system? These controls are created and configured under IMG and can be found at the following menu path ? SPRO ? IMG ? Sales and Distribution ? Sales ? Maintain copy control for sales documents. SPRO ? IMG ? Sales and Distribution ? Shipping ? Specify copy control for deliveries. SPRO ? IMG ? Sales and Distribution ? Billing ? Billing Documents ? Maintain copy control for billing. You can also use the following T-Codes to find copy controls in a system ? VTAA ? This control is used for copying from sales order to sales order VTLA ? This control is used control for copying from sales order to delivery VTFL ? This control is used control for copying from delivery to billing doc VTFF ? This control is used control for copying from billing doc to billing doc VTAF ? This control is used control for copying from billing doc to sales order VTFA ? This control is used control for copying from sales order to billing doc How Copy Controls work in SAP system? You can setup Copy controls in a system at three different levels in a Sales Order ? Header level. Item level. Schedule line level (Only relevant, when you copy from a sales order to sales order or from billing doc to sales order). The Header Copy Control routine is required when you copy data from header of a source document to the header of a target document. T-Code: VTLA to check copy control between sales order and delivery. You can check the source of a routing by selecting the routine and press F4. To open it in the ABAP editor, you can press F5. Copy controls for an item can be checked by a double click on the item folder and choosing an item category and then clicking on the Display view item overview screen. You can then use the F1 key to find out how each routine is employed. The target documents will be assigned an updated reference status in the copied item. The following types of status can be possible for an item ? Not relevant ? it tells if an item is not relevant for copying. Not referenced ? it tells an item has not been copied. Partially referenced ? it tells if an item quantity is fully copied. Fully referenced ? It tells if an entire item quantity has been copied or not and an item cannot be referenced further. You can also display reference status for a copy control ? Select the Header ? Status for the status of the entire document. This field is used ? Field VBUK-RFSTK. Select an Item ? To find the status of the line item. This field is used ? VBUP-RFSTA. SAP SD - Log of INComplete Items You can also define a sales activity or a sales document as incomplete. How the system behaves when you create such document in system is shown below. The following entries can be made to the system for incomplete data ? Header Data of a Sales document Item Data of a Sales Document Schedule Line Data of Sales Document Sales Activity Data Partner Data Delivery Header Data Delivery Item Data Use T-Code: OVA2 or the below menu path to display the incomplete group ?

Funds Management Account Assignment Data SAP SD - Pricing Pricing in Sales and Distribution is used to define the calculation of prices for external vendors or customers and cost. This condition is defined as a set of conditions when a price is calculated. Example Consider a case when customer orders specific quantity of a product on a particular day. Various factors like customer, product, order quantity and date tells the final price to that customer. This information is stored in the system as master data in the form of condition records. There are various pricing elements like prices, surcharges, discounts, and taxes, which are defined in SAP system as condition types. To manage pricing information for a pricing element in a system, you have to create condition records. Manual Pricing While processing a sales order, you can also manipulate the pricing at the item as well as the header level. Manual processing of a price screen is dependent on individual condition types. During a Sales Order processing using manual processing for a condition type, you can perform the below activities ? Deleting the pricing element. Changing a condition amount. Entering additional pricing elements. How to add Pricing elements manually? If you want to add customer discount manually in the pricing screen of a sales order, click on Add line. In Data screen, you can enter additional conditions like – customer discount in the condition type field. Enter a percentage range and then press ENTER. You can also delete pricing elements in item pricing and header screens. To do this, select the particular condition by positioning the cursor and click on delete line. Note that all header conditions defined at header level cannot be changed at the item level, and conditions defined at this level cannot be changed at the header level. Only the Conditions that you define at both header and item conditions can only be edited at both levels. SAP SD - Condition Record & Table A Condition table is defined as a combination of keys to identify an individual condition record. A condition record is defined as how system stores the specific condition. Example of a Condition Record ? Entering the price of a product or to specify the discount for a privileged customer. Example of a Condition Table ? Condition records for a customer specific material prices are stored by a sales department. SAP system contains a conditional table 005 for this purpose. Key of table 005 includes the following field ? Customer Material Sales Organization Distribution Channel In the first two fields, the customer and material determines the relationship between customers and specific materials. The last two fields are used to identify organization data in a SAP system. Now, if sales department in an organization enters a condition record for discount to one privileged customer, the system will automatically make use of the condition table 005 to store the record and define a key. Any standard SAP system contains predefined condition tables and specifies for each access in a predefined access sequence. Creating Condition Tables In a SAP system, you can create or change existing condition tables. As per the new business requirement in an organization, you can create new condition tables. Go to SPRO ? IMG ? Sales and Distribution ? Basic Functions ? Pricing ? Pricing Control ? Define Conditional Tables A new window will open and then you can select from create, change or display field as per the requirement. To create a new table, you have to select create and click on Choose. Enter condition table in table field and then you can enter the existing table to copy the condition. Once data is copied, you can modify the table as per the business requirement. SAP SD - Condition Techniques & Types Condition type is defined as specific features of daily pricing activities in a SAP system. Using the condition type, you can also put different condition types for each pricing, discounts on goods, tax and surcharge that occurs in business transactions. Example Condition type allows you to define the discount for special material. This can be specified in the system to calculate discount as an amount or it can calculate discount in terms of percentage. In case you have to use both discount types, two separate condition types have to be defined in the system. There are predefined condition types in a standard system ? S.No Condition Type & Description 1 PR00 Price 2 K004 Material Discount 3 K005 Customer-specific material discount 4 K007 Customer discount 5 K020 Price group discount 6 KF00 Freight surcharge(by item) 7 UTX1 State tax 8 UTX2 Country tax 9 UTX3 City tax How to create or change an existing condition type in a system?

SAP SD - Access Sequence This is the search strategy, which is used by the system to find valid data for a particular condition type. It tells about the order in which a system searches for the data. An access sequence consists of one or more access sequences. It helps the system to search first, second and so on until it finds a valid record. An access sequence is defined for each condition type where a condition record is created. You can create or maintain access sequence in customizing ? Go to SPRO ? IMG ? Sales and Distribution ? Basic Functions ? Pricing ? Pricing Control ? Define Access Sequences. Determine Pricing by item Category It is not necessary that all the items are suitable for pricing or not. If an item is not relevant for pricing, then line item will be blank for that item. An Item category is used to control the pricing of an item. Billing Item Categories An item is suitable for billing? Cost of item should be determined? Is it a return item? Whether it is a statistical item? T-Code: OVKO Enter Pricing flag in pricing field. Enter Statistical value as ? Blank, X, Y. Statistical value flag control an item in sales document as shown below. Click the save button. SAP SD - Prices, Surcharges & Discounts Prices and Types In a standard SAP system, price is defined as gross price of a material. Below are the predefined price types in a system ? Material Price Price List Type Customer specific price By default, the system takes gross price in the automatic pricing for a business transaction. In a standard SAP system, system takes customer specific price. If no such price exists, system checks for a valid price list type. If this is also not present in the system, it takes the material price. Material Prices When material price is created, it means – the price for a specific material or pricing for a specific material type. A combination of sales organization and distribution channel for which material price is valid. Price List Types As per your business requirement in an organization, you can define your own price list. Example ? Price list can be created as per the customer type like Retail, Wholesale customer and so on. Price list can also be created as per currency type. Customer Specific Prices ? You can also create pricing records for specific customers. You can assign pricing record for specific combination of customers and material type. Surcharges and Discounts A standard SAP system includes a variety of common discount types. You can also define or customize discounts and surcharges as per the business requirement. A Standard SAP system includes the below mentioned discount types ? Discount(Key) Kind of Discount Customer(K007) Percentage Material(K004) Absolute Price group(K020) Percentage Material group(K029) Absolute discount by weight Customer/material(K005) Absolute Customer/material group(K030) Percentage Price group/material(K032) Absolute Price group/material group(K030) Percentage Rebate processing(BO01) Group rebate(%) Rebate processing(BO02) Material rebate(fixed) Rebate processing(BO03) Customer rebate(%) Inter-company processing(PI01) Intercompany discount(fixed) Inter-company processing(PI02) Intercompany discount(%) Invoice lists(RL00) Factoring discount Invoice lists(MW15) Factoring discount tax While creating a condition record, you can use any of above standard discount types. While doing automatic pricing, system checks for the discount that satisfies a certain condition and it checks for a valid condition record. If a discount refers to a group like a material group or price groups, that particular group must be assigned to a relevant customer or material master record before automatic pricing is done in the system. SAP SD - Product Proposals A Product Proposal helps an organization to increase the sales by recommending other products to the already added products or by replacing the one already added. The products recommended can be cheaper, expensive or similar to the product that are requested by the customer. An Automatic Product Proposal is one of the most powerful tool used in online marketing of products. Product Proposals can be mapped to specific requirement of business partners to match their market requirement. You can use Top n Product list to provide the list of products proposed. The data in a product proposal is integrated with SAP CRM module to get product master data. A Product proposal also supports features like cross selling, up selling and down selling, Top N Product list, proposing accessories for specific products and generating product proposals with respect to specific promotions. Cross Selling ? The product association rules are defined for products and relationship between different products. Each rule contains a leading product and the dependent products to be suggested with these products. This allows you to offer other products with the one already added by a customer. Up-Selling and Down Selling ? If you are selling a specific product you can define other products to be proposed. These proposed products are defined using down selling and up selling rules. Top N Product Lists ? With the use of SAP NetWeaver BI component, you can define a list of top products for a target group. Proposing Accessories ? This is maintained in the product master data and with already added products. It suggests suitable accessories that can be added. Generating Product Proposal w.r.t specific promotions ? You can assign a specific product to a promotion for a customer. SAP SD - Listing, Determination & Exclusion Listing, Determination and material exclusion is a key feature provided by SAP SD that allows the sale of materials to allowed/disallowed customers. Listing ? You can create a material list for specific customers, which allows those customers to order only those materials which are maintained in the list. Exclusion ? You can also maintain an exclusion record for specific customers and this doesn’t allow that customer to order those materials. To display Material listing and exclusion, go to SPRO ? Sales and Distribution ? Basic functions ? Listing/Exclusion. A new window will open, then you can Activate Listing/Exclusion as shown in the following image and then click choose.

SAP SD - Sales Order Types In a SAP system, you define different sales document types according to different business transactions. Business transactions are recorded in a system as sales documents and are grouped into the below mentioned categories ? Inquiries and Quotations come under pre-sales documents. Sales Orders ? that are placed by customers. Outline agreement ? includes contracts and scheduling documents. Post sales documents ? includes customer feedbacks on delivered products and complaints, free replacements and return products, etc. Types of Sales Orders Cash Sales This is defined as an order type, where the customer places an order, picks up the order and pays for the goods. In this order type, delivery of the order is executed immediately, when the order has been entered. Cash invoice and billing can be printed immediately from the order. No receivables are entered for customer as invoice amount is paid in cash and directly entered to a cash account. Rush Order In this order type, delivery of goods is picked by the customer or you deliver the goods on the same day, when the order is placed. Scheduling Agreement A scheduling agreement is defined as an external agreement with the customer having details of quantity of goods and delivery dates. This information is mentioned as schedule lines in a standard system. These schedule lines can be created with the scheduling agreement or you can also create these at a later stage. The deliveries are processed for a scheduling agreement in similar way it is processed for a normal delivery. Once the delivery is done, system updates the delivered quantity in the scheduling agreement. Consignment Fill-up In this sales order type, goods are produced and moved to a warehouse or provided to an agent to deliver to end customer. Consignment Issue In this order type, whenever there is requirement from a customer, he will move to the warehouse or contact the agent and this will be treated as a sale. Third-Party Order In a third-party order type, products are not delivered to the customer and then you have to handover the order to a third-party vendor, who is responsible to deliver the items to the customer and generate the bill. SAP SD - Free of Charge Deliveries Free of charge delivery or subsequent delivery is made, when a customer is not satisfied with the products or the quantity of good is lesser when delivered. The company has to initiate a return as per the customer’s request. In this delivery, customer is not charged for shipping of goods. Steps to be followed in case of Return request Credit Memo ? This is done when the customer wants a refund for the delivered goods. The system creates a credit memo sales document for the customer with reference to the sales order. Subsequent Delivery ? This includes free of charge delivery of disputed goods to the customer. This is required when incorrect quantity of goods are delivered to the customer. Creating a return request in the system: T-Code: VA01. Then enter the details as shown below ? Enter Sale Order number and click Copy. Then you can enter the following details ? PO Number PO Date Order Reason Order Quantity and then Click save. For creating a Return Delivery Document, use T-Code: VL01N.

For creating Free of Charge Delivery, use T-Code: VA01 Order Type: Delivery free of charge Enter the PO number and click Copy. Enter Order Reason and Quantity. Click the save button. SAP SD - Outline Agreements The vendor selection is an important process in the procurement cycle. Vendors can be selected by a quotation process. Once these vendors are shortlisted by an organization. They enter into an agreement with a certain vendor to supply specific items with certain conditions. This happens when an agreement is reached or a formal contract is signed with the vendor. So, this outline agreement is a long term purchasing agreement with the vendor. The key points about an outline agreement are as follows ? An outline agreement is a long term purchasing agreement with the vendor. It contains the terms and conditions regarding the material that is to be supplied by the vendor. These outline agreements are valid up to a certain period of time and cover a certain predefined quantity or value. An Outline agreement is of two types, which includes ? Contract and a Scheduling Agreement. Contract Agreement A Contract is basically a long term outline agreement between the vendor and the ordering party. It is made on predefined material or services to be given over a certain framework of time. There are two types of contract ? Quantity Contract ? In this type of contract, the overall value is specified in terms of total quantity of material to be supplied by vendor. Value Contract ? In this contract type, the overall value is specified in terms of total amount to be paid for that material to the vendor. A Contract can be created by following the steps shown below ? Path to Create Contract Logistics ? Materials Management ? Purchasing ? Outline Agreement ? Contract ? Create. T-code: ME31K On the SAP Menu screen, select Create execute icon by following the above path.

Provide a delivery schedule date and target quantity. Click save. The schedule lines are now maintained for the scheduling agreement. SAP SD - Quota Arrangement A particular material can be procured from different vendors depending on the customer requirement. So, the total requirement of a material is distributed to different vendor’s i.e. quota is assigned to each source of supply. This is known as quota arrangement. The key points about quota arrangement are as follows ? Quota arrangement divides the total requirement of material among certain sources of supply, i.e. vendors and then assigns quota to each source. This particular quota specifies the portion of material that is to be procured from this assigned vendor or source. Quota rating is used to determine the amount of material that is to be assigned to a particular source or vendor. The source with lowest quota rating represents the valid source. Quota rating can be calculated by the following formula ? Quota rating = (Quota Allocated Quantity + Quota Base Quantity)/Quota Where the Quota Allocated Quantity is the total quantity from all orders that are procured from a particular source. Quota Base Quantity is the quantity from a new source of supply. Quota is the total requirement of material that is given to a particular source of supply. The mandatory setting before creating quota is – information record and source list should be maintained for the particular material. Also, in the material master, the source list and quota arrangement usage check box should be checked. This setting can be made in the material master by going to T-Code MM03. In the purchasing view, check the quota arrangement usage and source list. Setting is now maintained for quota arrangement. Create Quota Arrangement Quota arrangement divides the total requirement of a material among certain sources of supply i.e. vendors. Quota arrangement can be created by following the steps shown below. Path to create Quota Arrangement ? Logistics ? Materials Management ? Purchasing ? Master Data ? Quota Arrangement ? Maintain. T-Code: MEQ1 On the Sap Menu screen, select Maintain execute icon by following the above step. Enter the material number and plant for which quota arrangement needs to be maintained. Enter the names of the vendor’s along with all the assigned and allocated quantity to them. Click save. Quota arrangement is now maintained for this particular material. SAP SD - Special Business Process In SAP Sales and Distribution module, along with the processing of normal sales orders, you can also create special business processes like configurable products, items manufactured on order, etc. Consignments Processing Consignments are known as products, which are owned by your company and are located at the client location. It is not required for the customer to pay for these goods, until they are moved from the consignment stock. The customers can also return the products in consignment stock, which are not required. Key Features of Consignment Stock The goods in a consignment stock can be accessed by the customer at any time. Consignment goods are stored by the customers at their warehouse. Customer has to only pay for goods, which are removed from the stock and only for the quantity taken. As the consignment stock is still a part of company’s valuable stock, so there is a need to manage this in the system. You must manage the consignment stock separately, so that company should be aware, which stock is available at the customer location. This should be managed separately for each customer. For an organization, consignment stock is managed as a special stock in inventory and this helps you to track returnable goods from the customer. Consignment stock management includes four key activities in the system, which are ? Creating a Consignment Fill-Up (Stock is fill up at warehouse). Creating Consignment Issue (Stock issued from warehouse). Creating a Consignment Pick-Up (Stock return to manufacturer). Displaying Consignment Returns (Stock return from customer). Creating a Consignment Fill-up In this, stock is stored at the customer location and owned by the company. This is called Consignment fill up (CF) and sales order –KB is used for this. T-Code: VA01 Enter Order Type and then enter Organization Data ? A new window will open, then you can enter the following details ? Purchase Order Number Purchase Order Date Order Quantity Once these details are entered, click Save. Consignment Issue This is for the goods that are issued to the customer from a warehouse.

Consignment Pickup When a customer requests return of a product to the company, this is known as a consignment pick up. T-Code: VA01 Order Type: CP Sales Order Type: KR Once these details are entered, click save. SAP SD - Shipping Shipping is defined as a very important activity in the sales process. It comes under the logistics chain and guarantees customer service and distribution of goods. It is a significant component of Sales and Distribution module. It is used to perform outbound delivery and other shipping activities like picking and packing of the goods. In the shipping process, there are a few key sub processes, which include ? Delivery processing of the goods Picking of items Packing of the goods Post goods issue Shipping communication Planning & monitoring of shipping Other functions like batch determination, serial numbers, inspection, etc. Organizational Units in Shipping In shipping the stock of goods is managed at Storage Locations. The shipping point key characteristics include ? It is under client location. An Outbound Delivery is processed from a single Shipping point. Shipping point is determined at Item level in the order. Shipping point can process outbound deliveries of several plants. You can also assign several shipping points to one plant, but each point should have a different loading equipment or a different processing time. Other Organization units are warehouse#, type of storage, etc. There is a warehouse# that is assigned to a plant and storage location. There can be multiple storage locations in a plant and they can point to one warehouse. Shipping Point & Route Determination Route determination is done based on the target country and transportation zone along with the shipping point. If you have the same shipping points for two deliveries to the same country and same transportation zone, then the same route determination is applied to both. While creating a delivery document, its route is determined based on the shipping party and ship to party information. How to define Modes of Transport? Go to: SPRO ? IMG ? Logistics Execution ?

Material Document Accounting Document SAP SD - Introduction To Billing In SAP Sales and Distribution module, billing is known as the final stage for executing business transactions. When an order is processed and delivery is made, billing information is available at each stage of this order processing. Billing contains the following components ? Credit and Debit memos for return goods. Invoice creation for delivery and services. Cancel Billing transactions. Pricing Functions. Discount and Rebates. Transferring billing data to Financial Accounting FI. Billing is closely integrated with organization structure and it can be assigned to Sales Organization, a Distribution Channel, and a division. Key functions in Billing ? Types of Billing Match codes Number Range Blocking Reasons Display billing list Display billing due list Billing Document Types A billing document is created for a credit memo, debit memo, an invoice or a cancelled transaction. Each billing document has a header and list of items under it. Billing documents are normally controlled by the billing type. In a billing document header, it contains general data like ? Date of Billing Payer identification number Billing value Currency Partner Identification numbers like ship to party, sold to party, etc. Pricing Elements In the list of items, you should maintain the following data ? Material Number Quantity of goods Volume and weight Value of Individual items Pricing element for individual items While doing the billing processing, you create, change and delete the billing documents like ? invoices, credit memos, debit memos, etc. Billing Processing also includes creation of billing documents as per the below reference ? To a sales order To a delivery To external transactions You can refer to an entire document, individual items or partial quantities of items. A Billing document can be created in the following ways ? When a system processes a billing due list automatically as a background task. By manually processing from a worklist.

You can use the following billing method types ? Individual Billing per sales document. Collective Billing method for multiple sales document. Invoice Split for several billing documents for one or more sales document. In Individual Billing method, you can make the setting in system to create single billing document for each sales document. Example: One invoice per delivery. In Collective Billing, it allows you to combine different documents like sales orders and/or deliveries either partially or fully in a common billing document. Invoice Splits allow you to create invoices as per the specific criteria. Billing Plan A billing plan in SAP SD is defined as a plan with individual billing dates for goods and services and it doesn’t depend on the delivery of goods. Using this bill plan, you can bill for a service or product at regular time intervals or at specific dates defined in the system in advance. As per the business transactions, a system allows you to process any of the billing plan type. There are two types of billing plan ? Milestone Billing Periodic Billing Milestone billing includes dividing the total billed amount in multiple billing dates that are defined in a billing plan. When there is a milestone reached as per defined in the system, customer is charged as per the project cost or a predefined amount as per the bill plan. Milestone billing is normally used for long term projects. Periodic billing includes charging of bill amount at a regular interval of time. Example: Suppose you have to pay a rental amount monthly as per the contract. The system can process monthly payment as per the schedule. Periodic billing plan is normally used in the following categories ? For a Service like Annual Maintenance contracts, etc. For lease agreements. Intellectual Property Management. Assigning Billing Plans to Business Transactions In SAP system, you can mention if one billing plan is applicable for all the products in a business transaction or you can define separate bill plans for each transaction goods as per the requirement. Note that you can define a billing plan in SAP CRM system ? Customer Relationship Management ? Transactions ? Basic Settings ? Billing Plan You cannot use billing plans created in SAP CRM system in SAP ERP system. Revenue Account Determination Revenue account is used for revenue recognition and is used for integrating SAP SD module and Finance Accounting module. As per the billing document to account, system determines the correct G/L account for posting the revenue as per the revenue account determination.

Useful Structure in Revenue Account Determination ? S.No Structure & Description 1 KOMKCV Account Determination Communication Header 2 KOMPCV Account Determination Communication Item SAP SD - Credit Management Credit management deals with selling of goods and collecting money at a later stage. The credit limit for a customer depends on the payment method and customer payment history. The payment for the goods is based on payment conditions based on the business transaction. Example A customer’s credit limit is set as 10000 and he makes an order worth 6000 and payment term of 30 days at 4%. Now if payment is made within 30 days, customer will get 4% discount on the payment. Why do we need Credit Management? Credit management allows you to reduce the credit risk by setting up the credit limit for the customers. You can get warning alerts for a customer or a group of customers. Key Features of Credit Management As per your credit needs, you can define your various credit policies as per different criteria. This also allows you to define key points in Sales and Distribution system, where the system checks are performed. While processing an order, the system allows a representative to get the information about customer’s credit details. When a customer is about to reach his credit limit. An electronic email can be sent to the customer automatically. The credit representative in your company has an option to review the credit situation of a customer quickly and accurately and to decide if to extend the credit limit or not. Types of Credit Management There are two types of credit management ? Simple Credit Check Automatic Credit Check Simple credit check involves comparing customer credit limit to the total of all items and open item values in the order. Credit Limit = Open item values + Value of current Sales Order Open items are defined as the products that are invoiced to the customer, but payment has not been received yet. You can configure the system in such a way that it sends a warning message to the customer, when their credit limit is exceeded. Automatic Credit Check involves checking open items and open deliveries of goods as well. If the credit limit is crossed, a customer can still make the order because of a good payment history with the company. This can be defined as ? Static and dynamic credit check. Static Credit Limit Determination Types of checking groups ? Sales, Delivery and Good Issue. You can block the order at all these levels. Risk Category ? It is used to determine how much credit has to be given to the customer. High Risk ? Low Credit Low Risk ? More Credit Medium Risk ? Average Credit Dynamic Credit Limit Determination It is used to determine the credit limit of their customer by considering a horizon period ? Open Document Open Deliveries Open Billings Open Items Horizon Period Now if the horizon period is defined as 4 months, the system will not consider these documents for 4 months. Assigning Company Code to Credit Control Area SPRO ? IMG ? Enterprise Structure ? Assignment ? Financial Accounting ? Assign company code to credit control area A new window will open, then you can set the automatic credit check. Defining Credit Groups Go to: SPRO ? IMG ? Sales and Distribution ? Basic Functions ?
