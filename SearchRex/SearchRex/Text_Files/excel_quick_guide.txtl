Adjust Margins in Excel 2010 Margins Margins are the unprinted areas along the sides, top, and bottom of a printed page. All printed pages in MS Excel have the same margins. You can’t specify different margins for different pages. You can set margins by various ways as explained below. Choose Page Layout » Page Setup » Margins drop-down list, you can select Normal, Wide, Narrow, or the custom Setting. These options are also available when you choose File » Print. If none of these settings does the job, choose Custom Margins to display the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box, as shown below. Center on Page By default, Excel aligns the printed page at the top and left margins. If you want the output to be centered vertically or horizontally, select the appropriate check box in the Center on Page section of the Margins tab as shown in the above screenshot. Page Orientation in Excel 2010 Page Orientation Page orientation refers to how output is printed on the page. If you change the orientation, the onscreen page breaks adjust automatically to accommodate the new paper orientation. Types of Page Orientation Portrait ? Portrait to print tall pages (the default).

If checked, the left header and footer will be aligned with the left margin, and the right header and footer will be aligned with the right margin. This option is enabled, by default. Insert Page Break in Excel 2010 Page Breaks If you don’t want a row to print on a page by itself or you don't want a table header row to be the last line on a page. MS Excel gives you precise control over page breaks. MS Excel handles page breaks automatically, but sometimes you may want to force a page break either a vertical or a horizontal one. so that the report prints the way you want. For example, if your worksheet consists of several distinct sections, you may want to print each section on a separate sheet of paper. Inserting Page Breaks Insert Horizontal Page Break ? For example, if you want row 14 to be the first row of a new page, select cell A14. Then choose Page Layout » Page Setup Group » Breaks» Insert Page Break. Insert vertical Page break ?

Choose Page Layout » Page Setup » Breaks » Reset All Page Breaks. Set Background in Excel 2010 Background Image Unfortunately, you cannot have a background image on your printouts. You may have noticed the Page Layout » Page Setup » Background command. This button displays a dialogue box that lets you select an image to display as a background. Placing this control among the other print-related commands is very misleading. Background images placed on a worksheet are never printed. Alternative to Placing Background You can insert a Shape, WordArt, or a picture on your worksheet and then adjust its transparency. Then copy the image to all printed pages. You can insert an object in a page header or footer. Freeze Panes in Excel 2010 Freezing Panes If you set up a worksheet with row or column headings, these headings will not be visible when you scroll down or to the right. MS Excel provides a handy solution to this problem with freezing panes. Freezing panes keeps the headings visible while you’re scrolling through the worksheet.

Creating Formulas in Excel 2010 Formulas in MS Excel Formulas are the Bread and butter of worksheet. Without formula, worksheet will be just simple tabular representation of data. A formula consists of special code, which is entered into a cell. It performs some calculations and returns a result, which is displayed in the cell. Formulas use a variety of operators and worksheet functions to work with values and text. The values and text used in formulas can be located in other cells, which makes changing data easy and gives worksheets their dynamic nature. For example, you can quickly change the data in a worksheet and formulas works. Elements of Formulas A formula can consist of any of these elements ? Mathematical operators, such as +(for addition) and *(for multiplication) Example ? =A1+A2 Adds the values in cells A1 and A2. Values or text Example ? =200*0.5 Multiplies 200 times 0.15. This formula uses only values, and it always returns the same result as 100. Cell references (including named cells and ranges) Example ? =A1=C12 Compares cell A1 with cell C12. If the cells are identical, the formula returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Worksheet functions (such as SUMor AVERAGE) Example ? =SUM(A1:A12) Adds the values in the range A1:A12. Creating Formula For creating a formula you need to type in the Formula Bar. Formula begins with '=' sign. When building formulas manually, you can either type in the cell addresses or you can point to them in the worksheet. Using the Pointing method to supply the cell addresses for formulas is often easier and more powerful method of formula building. When you are using built-in functions, you click the cell or drag through the cell range that you want to use when defining the function’s arguments in the Function Arguments dialog box. See the below screen shot. As soon as you complete a formula entry, Excel calculates the result, which is then displayed inside the cell within the worksheet (the contents of the formula, however, continue to be visible on the Formula bar anytime the cell is active). If you make an error in the formula that prevents Excel from being able to calculate the formula at all, Excel displays an Alert dialog box suggesting how to fix the problem. Copying Formulas in Excel 2010 Copying Formulas in MS Excel Copying formulas is one of the most common tasks that you do in a typical spreadsheet that relies primarily on formulas. When a formula uses cell references rather than constant values, Excel makes the task of copying an original formula to every place that requires a similar formula. Relative Cell Addresses MS Excel does it automatically adjusting the cell references in the original formula to suit the position of the copies that you make. It does this through a system known as relative cell addresses, where by the column references in the cell address in the formula change to suit their new column position and the row references change to suit their new row position. Let us see this with the help of example. Suppose we want the sum of all the rows at last, then we will write a formula for first column i.e. B. We want sum of the rows from 3 to 8 in the 9th row. After writing formula in the 9th row, we can drag it to remaining columns and the formula gets copied. After dragging we can see the formula in the remaining columns as below. column C : =SUM(C3:C8) column D : =SUM(D3:D8) column E : =SUM(E3:E8) column F : =SUM(F3:F8) column G : =SUM(G3:G8) Formula Reference in Excel 2010 Cell References in Formulas Most formulas you create include references to cells or ranges. These references enable your formulas to work dynamically with the data contained in those cells or ranges. For example, if your formula refers to cell C2 and you change the value contained in C2, the formula result reflects new value automatically. If you didn’t use references in your formulas, you would need to edit the formulas themselves in order to change the values used in the formulas. When you use a cell (or range) reference in a formula, you can use three types of references ? relative, absolute, and mixed references. Relative Cell References The row and column references can change when you copy the formula to another cell because the references are actually offsets from the current row and column. By default, Excel creates relative cell references in formulas. Absolute Cell References The row and column references do not change when you copy the formula because the reference is to an actual cell address. An absolute reference uses two dollar signs in its address: one for the column letter and one for the row number (for example, $A$5). Mixed Cell References Both the row or column reference is relative and the other is absolute. Only one of the address parts is absolute (for example, $A5 or A$5). Using Functions in Excel 2010 Functions in Formula Many formulas you create use available worksheet functions. These functions enable you to greatly enhance the power of your formulas and perform calculations that are difficult if you use only the operators. For example, you can use the LOG or SIN function to calculate the Logarithm or Sin ratio. You can’t do this complicated calculation by using the mathematical operators alone. Using Functions When you type = sign and then type any alphabet you will see the searched functions as below. Suppose you need to determine the largest value in a range. A formula can’t tell you the answer without using a function. We will use formula that uses the MAX function to return the largest value in the range B3:B8 as =MAX(A1:D100). Another example of functions. Suppose you want to find if the cell of month is greater than 1900 then we can give Bonus to Sales representative. The we can achieve it with writing formula with IF functions as =IF(B9>1900,"Yes","No") Function Arguments In the above examples, you may have noticed that all the functions used parentheses. The information inside the parentheses is the list of arguments. Functions vary in how they use arguments. Depending on what it has to do, a function may use. No arguments ? Examples ? Now(), Date(), etc. One argument ? UPPER(), LOWER(), etc. A fixed number of arguments ? IF(), MAX(), MIN(), AVERGAGE(), etc. Infinite number of arguments Optional arguments Built-in Functions in Excel 2010 Built In Functions MS Excel has many built in functions, which we can use in our formula. To see all the functions by category, choose Formulas Tab » Insert Function. Then Insert function Dialog appears from which we can choose the function. Functions by Categories Let us see some of the built in functions in MS Excel. Text Functions LOWER ? Converts all characters in a supplied text string to lower case UPPER ? Converts all characters in a supplied text string to upper case TRIM ? Removes duplicate spaces, and spaces at the start and end of a text string CONCATENATE ? Joins together two or more text strings. LEFT ? Returns a specified number of characters from the start of a supplied text string. MID ? Returns a specified number of characters from the middle of a supplied text string RIGHT ? Returns a specified number of characters from the end of a supplied text string. LEN ?

Converts a text string showing a date, to an integer that represents the date in Excel's date-time code. TIMEVALUE ? Converts a text string showing a time, to a decimal that represents the time in Excel. NOW ? Returns the current date & time. TODAY ? Returns today's date. Statistical MAX ? Returns the largest value from a list of supplied numbers. MIN ? Returns the smallest value from a list of supplied numbers. AVERAGE ? Returns the Average of a list of supplied numbers. COUNT ? Returns the number of numerical values in a supplied set of cells or values. COUNTIF ? Returns the number of cells (of a supplied range), that satisfies a given criteria. SUM ? Returns the sum of a supplied list of numbers Logical AND ? Tests a number of user-defined conditions and returns TRUE if ALL of the conditions evaluate to TRUE, or FALSE otherwise OR ? Tests a number of user-defined conditions and returns TRUE if ANY of the conditions evaluate to TRUE, or FALSE otherwise. NOT ? Returns a logical value that is the opposite of a user supplied logical value or expression i.e. returns FALSE if the supplied argument is TRUE and returns TRUE if the supplied argument is FAL Math & Trig ABS ? Returns the absolute value (i.e. the modulus) of a supplied number. SIGN ? Returns the sign (+1, -1 or 0) of a supplied number. SQRT ? Returns the positive square root of a given number. MOD ? Returns the remainder from a division between two supplied numbers. Data Filtering in Excel 2010 Filters in MS Excel Filtering data in MS Excel refers to displaying only the rows that meet certain conditions. (The other rows gets hidden.) Using the store data, if you are interested in seeing data where Shoe Size is 36, then you can set filter to do this. Follow the below mentioned steps to do this. Place a cursor on the Header Row. Choose Data Tab » Filter to set filter. Click the drop-down arrow in the Area Row Header and remove the check mark from Select All, which unselects everything. Then select the check mark for Size 36 which will filter the data and displays data of Shoe Size 36. Some of the row numbers are missing; these rows contain the filtered (hidden) data. There is drop-down arrow in the Area column now shows a different graphic — an icon that indicates the column is filtered. Using Multiple Filters You can filter the records by multiple conditions i.e. by multiple column values. Suppose after size 36 is filtered, you need to have the filter where color is equal to Coffee. After setting filter for Shoe Size, choose Color column and then set filter for color. Data Sorting in Excel 2010 Sorting in MS Excel Sorting data in MS Excel rearranges the rows based on the contents of a particular column. You may want to sort a table to put names in alphabetical order. Or, maybe you want to sort data by Amount from smallest to largest or largest to smallest. To Sort the data follow the steps mentioned below. Select the Column by which you want to sort data. Choose Data Tab » Sort Below dialog appears. If you want to sort data based on a selected column, Choose Continue with the selection or if you want sorting based on other columns, choose Expand Selection. You can Sort based on the below Conditions. Values ? Alphabetically or numerically. Cell Color ? Based on Color of Cell. Font Color ? Based on Font color. Cell Icon ? Based on Cell Icon. Clicking Ok will sort the data. Sorting option is also available from the Home Tab. Choose Home Tab » Sort & Filter. You can see the same dialog to sort records. Using Ranges in Excel 2010 Ranges in MS Excel A cell is a single element in a worksheet that can hold a value, some text, or a formula. A cell is identified by its address, which consists of its column letter and row number. For example, cell B1 is the cell in the second column and the first row. A group of cells is called a range. You designate a range address by specifying its upper-left cell address and its lower-right cell address, separated by a colon. Example of Ranges ? C24 ? A range that consists of a single cell. A1:B1 ? Two cells that occupy one row and two columns. A1:A100 ? 100 cells in column A. A1:D4 ? 16 cells (four rows by four columns). Selecting Ranges You can select a range in several ways ? Press the left mouse button and drag, highlighting the range. Then release the mouse button. If you drag to the end of the screen, the worksheet will scroll. Press the Shift key while you use the navigation keys to select a range. Press F8 and then move the cell pointer with the navigation keys to highlight the range. Press F8 again to return the navigation keys to normal movement. Type the cell or range address into the Name box and press Enter. Excel selects the cell or range that you specified. Selecting Complete Rows and Columns When you need to select an entire row or column. You can select entire rows and columns in much the same manner as you select ranges ? Click the row or column border to select a single row or column. To select multiple adjacent rows or columns, click a row or column border and drag to highlight additional rows or columns. To select multiple (nonadjacent) rows or columns, press Ctrl while you click the row or column borders that you want. Data Validation in Excel 2010 Data Validation MS Excel data validation feature allows you to set up certain rules that dictate what can be entered into a cell. For example, you may want to limit data entry in a particular cell to whole numbers between 0 and 10. If the user makes an invalid entry, you can display a custom message as shown below. Validation Criteria To specify the type of data allowable in a cell or range, follow the steps below, which shows all the three tabs of the Data Validation dialog box. Select the cell or range. Choose Data » Data Tools » Data Validation. Excel displays its Data Validation dialog box having 3 tabs settings, Input Message and Error alert. Settings Tab Here you can set the type of validation you need. Choose an option from the Allow drop-down list. The contents of the Data Validation dialog box will change, displaying controls based on your choice. Any Value ? Selecting this option removes any existing data validation. Whole Number ? The user must enter a whole number.For example, you can specify that the entry must be a whole number greater than or equal to 50. Decimal ? The user must enter a number. For example, you can specify that the entry must be greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 20. List ? The user must choose from a list of entries you provide. You will create drop-down list with this validation. You have to give input ranges then those values will appear in the drop-down. Date ? The user must enter a date. You specify a valid date range from choices in the Data drop-down list. For example, you can specify that the entered data must be greater than or equal to January 1, 2013, and less than or equal to December 31, 2013. Time ? The user must enter a time. You specify a valid time range from choices in the Data drop-down list. For example, you can specify that the entered data must be later than 12:00 p.m. Text Length ? The length of the data (number of characters) is limited. You specify a valid length by using the Data drop-down list. For example, you can specify that the length of the entered data be 1 (a single alphanumeric character). Custom ? To use this option, you must supply a logical formula that determines the validity of the user’s entry (a logical formula returns either TRUE or FALSE). Input Message Tab You can set the input help message with this tab. Fill the title and Input message of the Input message tab and the input message will appear when the cell is selected. Error Alert Tab You can specify an error message with this tab. Fill the title and error message. Select the style of the error as stop, warning or Information as per you need. Using Styles in Excel 2010 Using Styles in MS Excel With MS Excel 2010 Named styles make it very easy to apply a set of predefined formatting options to a cell or range. It saves time as well as make sure that look of the cells are consistent. A Style can consist of settings for up to six different attributes ? Number format Font (type, size, and color) Alignment (vertical and horizontal) Borders Pattern Protection (locked and hidden) Now, let us see how styles are helpful. Suppose that you apply a particular style to some twenty cells scattered throughout your worksheet. Later, you realize that these cells should have a font size of 12 pt. rather than 14 pt. Rather than changing each cell, simply edit the style. All cells with that particular style change automatically. Applying Styles Choose Home » Styles » Cell Styles. Note that this display is a live preview, that is, as you move your mouse over the style choices, the selected cell or range temporarily displays the style. When you see a style you like, click it to apply the style to the selection. Creating Custom Style in MS Excel We can create new custom style in Excel 2010. To create a new style, follow these steps ? Select a cell and click on Cell styles from Home Tab. Click on New Cell Style and give style name. Click on Format to apply formatting to the cell. After applying formatting click on OK. This will add new style in the styles. You can view it on Home » Styles.

Cross Referencing in Excel 2010 Graphic Objects in MS Excel When you have information spread across several different spreadsheets, it can seem a daunting task to bring all these different sets of data together into one meaningful list or table. This is where the Vlookup function comes into its own. VLOOKUP VlookUp searches for a value vertically down for the lookup table. VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,range_lookup) has 4 parameters as below. lookup_value ? It is the user input. This is the value that the function uses to search on. The table_array ? It is the area of cells in which the table is located. This includes not only the column being searched on, but the data columns for which you are going to get the values that you need. Col_index_num ? It is the column of data that contains the answer that you want. Range_lookup ? It is a TRUE or FALSE value. When set to TRUE, the lookup function gives the closest match to the lookup_value without going over the lookup_value. When set to FALSE, an exact match must be found to the lookup_value or the function will return #N/A. Note, this requires that the column containing the lookup_value be formatted in ascending order. VLOOKUP Example Let's look at a very simple example of cross-referencing two spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet contains information about the same group of people. The first spreadsheet has their dates of birth, and the second shows their favorite color. How do we build a list showing the person's name, their date of birth and their favorite color? VLOOOKUP will help in this case. First of all, let us see data in both the sheets. This is data in the first sheet This is data in the second sheet Now for finding the respective favorite color for that person from another sheet we need to vlookup the data. First argument to the VLOOKUP is lookup value (In this case it is person name). Second argument is the table array, which is table in the second sheet from B2 to C11. Third argument to VLOOKUP is Column index num, which is the answer we are looking for. In this case, it is 2 the color column number is 2. The fourth argument is True returning partial match or false returning exact match. After applying VLOOKUP formula it will calculate the color and the results are displayed as below. As you can see in the above screen-shot that results of VLOOKUP has searched for color in the second sheet table. It has returned #N/A in case where match is not found. In this case, Andy's data is not present in the second sheet so it returned #N/A.

Workbook protection ? Protecting a workbook from having sheets inserted or deleted, and also requiring the use of password to open the workbook. Protect Worksheet You may want to protect a worksheet for a variety of reasons. One reason is to prevent yourself or others from accidentally deleting the formulas or other critical data. A common scenario is to protect a worksheet, so that the data can be changed, but the formulas can’t be changed. To protect a worksheet, choose Review » Changes group » Protect Sheet. Excel displays the Protect Sheet dialog box. Note that providing a password is optional. If you enter a password, that password will be required to unprotect the worksheet. You can select various options in which the sheet should be protected. Suppose we checked Format Cells option then Excel will not allow to format cells. When somebody tries to format the cells, he or she will get the error as shown in the screenshot below. To unprotect a protected sheet, choose Review » Changes group » Unprotect Sheet. If the sheet was protected with a password, you’re prompted to enter that password. Protecting a Workbook Excel provides three ways to protect a workbook. Requires a password to open the workbook. Prevents the users from adding sheets, deleting sheets, hiding sheets, and unhiding sheets. Prevents users from changing the size or position of windows. Requiring a Password to Open a Workbook Excel lets you save a workbook with a password. After doing so, whoever tries to open the workbook, must enter the password. To add a password to a workbook, follow these steps. Choose File » Info » Protect Workbook » Encrypt With Password. Excel displays the Encrypt Document dialog box. Type a password and click OK.

When a workbook’s structure and windows are protected, the user may not Add a sheet, Delete a sheet, Hide a sheet, unhide a sheet, etc., and may not be allowed to change the size or position of a workbook’s windows respectively. To protect a worksheet’s structure and windows, follow the below mentioned steps. Choose Review » Changes group » Protect Workbook to display the Protect Workbook dialog box.

Data Tables in Excel 2010 Data Tables In Excel, a Data Table is a way to see different results by altering an input cell in your formula. Data tables are available in Data Tab » What-If analysis dropdown » Data table in MS Excel. Data Table with Example Now, let us see data table concept with an example. Suppose you have the Price and quantity of many values. Also, you have the discount for that as third variable for calculating the Net Price. You can keep the Net Price value in the organized table format with the help of the data table. Your Price runs horizontally to the right while quantity runs vertically down. We are using a formula to calculate the Net Price as Price multiplied by Quantity minus total discount (Quantity * Discount for each quantity). Now, for creation of data table select the range of data table. Choose Data Tab » What-If analysis dropdown » Data table. It will give you dialogue asking for Input row and Input Column. Give the Input row as Price cell (In this case cell B3) and Input column as quantity cell (In this case cell B4). Please see the below screen-shot. Clicking OK will generate data table as shown in the below screen-shot. It will generate the table formula. You can change the price horizontally or quantity vertically to see the change in the Net Price. Pivot Tables in Excel 2010 Pivot Tables A pivot table is essentially a dynamic summary report generated from a database. The database can reside in a worksheet (in the form of a table) or in an external data file. A pivot table can help transform endless rows and columns of numbers into a meaningful presentation of the data. Pivot tables are very powerful tool for summarized analysis of the data. Pivot tables are available under Insert tab » PivotTable dropdown » PivotTable. Pivot Table Example Now, let us see Pivot table with the help of example. Suppose you have huge data of voters and you want to see the summarized data of voter Information per party, then you can use the Pivot table for it. Choose Insert tab » Pivot Table to insert pivot table. MS Excel selects the data of the table. You can select the pivot table location as existing sheet or new sheet. This will generate the Pivot table pane as shown below. You have various options available in the Pivot table pane. You can select fields for the generated pivot table. Column labels ? A field that has a column orientation in the pivot table. Each item in the field occupies a column. Report Filter ? You can set the filter for the report as year, then data gets filtered as per the year. Row labels ? A field that has a row orientation in the pivot table. Each item in the field occupies a row. Values area ? The cells in a pivot table that contain the summary data. Excel offers several ways to summarize the data (sum, average, count, and so on). After giving input fields to the pivot table, it generates the pivot table with the data as shown below. Simple Charts in Excel 2010 Charts A chart is a visual representation of numeric values. Charts (also known as graphs) have been an integral part of spreadsheets. Charts generated by early spreadsheet products were quite crude, but thy have improved significantly over the years. Excel provides you with the tools to create a wide variety of highly customizable charts. Displaying data in a well-conceived chart can make your numbers more understandable. Because a chart presents a picture, charts are particularly useful for summarizing a series of numbers and their interrelationships. Types of Charts There are various chart types available in MS Excel as shown in the below screen-shot. Column ? Column chart shows data changes over a period of time or illustrates comparisons among items. Bar ? A bar chart illustrates comparisons among individual items. Pie ? A pie chart shows the size of items that make up a data series, proportional to the sum of the items. It always shows only one data series and is useful when you want to emphasize a significant element in the data. Line ? A line chart shows trends in data at equal intervals. Area ? An area chart emphasizes the magnitude of change over time. X Y Scatter ? An xy (scatter) chart shows the relationships among the numeric values in several data series, or plots two groups of numbers as one series of xy coordinates. Stock ? This chart type is most often used for stock price data, but can also be used for scientific data (for example, to indicate temperature changes). Surface ? A surface chart is useful when you want to find the optimum combinations between two sets of data. As in a topographic map, colors and patterns indicate areas that are in the same range of values. Doughnut ? Like a pie chart, a doughnut chart shows the relationship of parts to a whole; however, it can contain more than one data series. Bubble ? Data that is arranged in columns on a worksheet, so that x values are listed in the first column and corresponding y values and bubble size values are listed in adjacent columns, can be plotted in a bubble chart. Radar ? A radar chart compares the aggregate values of a number of data series. Creating Chart To create charts for the data by below mentioned steps. Select the data for which you want to create the chart. Choose Insert Tab » Select the chart or click on the Chart group to see various chart types.
