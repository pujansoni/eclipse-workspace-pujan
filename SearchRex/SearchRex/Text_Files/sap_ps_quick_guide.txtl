It helps you to manage the project life cycle starting from structuring to planning, execution, until the project completion. Project system is closely integrated with other SAP modules like logistics, material management, Sales and Distribution, Plant Maintenance, and Production planning module. It enables organizations to manage all SAP projects- large and small-scale projects efficiently. The Project Manager has a task to ensure that these projects are executed within budget and time and to ensure that resources are allocated to the project as per the requirement. Before a project is initiated, it is required that project goal is clearly defined and the activities be structured. The integration between SAP Project System PS with SAP ERP R/3 application modules allows you to design, plan, and execute the projects as part of your normal project procedure. Hence, Project System module has the constant data access to all the departments involved in the project. Classification of Projects As per budget, projects can be categorized in the following categories ? External Financed Projects ? This includes the projects which are sponsored by clients and are executed to meet the client requirements. These projects are called customer projects and project goal is aligned to meet the customer demand. Internal Financed Projects ? This includes project related to capital investment or overhead cost projects. You can also categorize projects according to the list of activities and project structure or on the basis of individual activities ? Using Work breakdown structure WBS. Using individual activities as per work packages. In Project System, Work Breakdown structure and network diagram can be used to structure the project either in hierarchical order or in using network techniques. You can define key milestones and documents that allow you to monitor the progress of project and helps you to define key interest of individuals. Project Structure can be defined either manually or based on templates. You can also create the Project structures using sales documents automatically. In the following diagram, you can see the sample project structure that is created hierarchically using Work Breakdown structure. Project System – Process Flow In Project System, each process has a defined set of tasks to be performed. These tasks are known as process flow in Project Lifecycle. When a project request is received, a project is created and it has to undergo the following steps in project process flow/lifecycle. Following are the key steps involved in Project process flow ? Create Templates/WBS Create Project Project Planning Budgeting and Release Project Implementation Project Completion Here is a diagrammatic representation of the process flow of SAP PS ? SAP PS - Integration with ERP Modules Project system is closely integrated with other SAP modules like logistics, material management, Sales and Distribution, Plant Maintenance, and Production planning module. The integration between SAP Project System PS with SAP ERP R/3 application modules allows you to design, plan, and execute the projects as part of your normal project procedure. Hence, Project System module has the constant data access to all the departments involved in the project. SAP PS system is tightly integrated with the following modules ? Finance and Controlling Module ? To plan the costs and revenue in the project system as per the financial planning requirements. Material Management MM ?

Other R/3 modules ? Other modules like plant maintenance, budget management, investment, etc. In the following diagram, you can see SAP Project System is integrated with SAP R/3 modules during project lifecycle. Organization Structure and Elements When a project is initiated, it starts with the definition and classification of the project structure, which is required to align it with the existing enterprise structure in an organization. Project System has no organizational structures of its own and we have to incorporate the structure to enterprise structure by assigning organization elements in different ERP R/3 modules. These organization elements allow Project system to maintain and get the data correctly. An Organization structure consists of various elements that have to be created as part of structuring of project. Following are the organization elements ? Company Code In SAP FI, a company can comprise of multiple codes, however it acts as a single unit for which financial statements are available. Company code is smallest unit in an organization for which financial statements (profit-loss statement, etc.) can be generated.

SAP PS - Currencies In SAP PS system, you can manage all the currency dependent data in the Project System using the following different currencies. Controlling Area Currency In this currency type, you define work breakdown structure (WBS), networks, activities, and orders in one controlling area. As the same controlling area is used, currency in a project system is also uniform. Object currency In Project System, it is possible to assign any object currency to different objects in the system. WBS element Project definition Network header Network activity Note ? When a company code is assigned to a controlling area and company code contains multiple currencies, you cannot allocate object currency in PS. In such a case, system automatically takes the local currency of company code. Transaction currency In this case, the costs and revenues from different business transactions are recorded as per currency of the business transaction. Example You can take the currency of PO in which it is raised in the system. In PS system, each amount is recorded in the database in all three currencies and you use the currency translation rates in the PS implementation. Note ? You can use Information system to view the reports in any currency including the above mentioned currency types and Project System translates the values in report as per the latest conversion values.

SAP PS - Material This component is used to plan and manage material requirement in project and to manage the material flow in the project. Material requirement planning in project comes from Material management and Production Planning and Control. Procurement of Material using MRP MRP run or planning run is an engine, which is used to fill the demand and supply gap. Issues & Receipts are called MRP elements. Issues include PIRs, Dependent Requirements, Order Reservations, Sales Orders, Issuing Stock Transfer Orders, etc. Receipts include Production Orders, Purchase Requisitions, Purchase Orders, Open Production Orders, Receiving Stock Transfer Order, Schedule lines, etc. MRP Parameters MRP parameters are required to run material requirement planning to meet Planned Independent Requirement (PIR) and to use the Routing information. Different MRP parameters can be used. Processing Key NetChange ? In this run system consider those material which has undergone some changes from the previous MRP run. NetChange in planning horizon ? This run considers the requirement in predefined planning horizon and not like net change, which check the future requirements. In this run, the system considers only those material, which have undergone some changes from their last MRP run. Regenerative Planning ? In this run, the system considers all the material irrespective of changes. It is time consuming and not common in Production planning. Scheduling Basic Scheduling ? It only calculates the basic dates for orders in MRP run and in house production time for material master in use. Lead time Scheduling ? In this MRP, production dates are defined by lead-time scheduling for planned orders. Running Material Requirement Planning for all Products Step 1 ? Use T-code: MD01 or go to Logistics ?
