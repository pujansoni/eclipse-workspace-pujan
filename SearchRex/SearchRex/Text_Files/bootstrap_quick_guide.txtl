Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful, mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. History Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter. It was released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub. Why Use Bootstrap? Mobile first approach ? Bootstrap 3, framework consists of Mobile first styles throughout the entire library instead them of in separate files. Browser Support ? It is supported by all popular browsers. Easy to get started ? With just the knowledge of HTML and CSS anyone can get started with Bootstrap. Also the Bootstrap official site has a good documentation. Responsive design ? Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to Desktops, Tablets and Mobiles. More about the responsive design is in the chapter Bootstrap Responsive Design. Provides a clean and uniform solution for building an interface for developers. It contains beautiful and functional built-in components which are easy to customize. It also provides web based customization. And best of all it is an open source. What Bootstrap Package Includes? Scaffolding ? Bootstrap provides a basic structure with Grid System, link styles, and background. This is is covered in detail in the section Bootstrap Basic Structure CSS ? Bootstrap comes with the feature of global CSS settings, fundamental HTML elements styled and enhanced with extensible classes, and an advanced grid system. This is covered in detail in the section Bootstrap with CSS. Components ? Bootstrap contains over a dozen reusable components built to provide iconography, dropdowns, navigation, alerts, pop-overs, and much more. This is covered in detail in the section Layout Components. JavaScript Plugins ? Bootstrap contains over a dozen custom jQuery plugins. You can easily include them all, or one by one. This is covered in details in the section Bootstrap Plugins. Customize ? You can customize Bootstrap's components, LESS variables, and jQuery plugins to get your very own version. Bootstrap - Environment Setup Try it Option Online We have set up the Bootstrap environment online, so that you can execute all the available examples online. It gives you confidence in what you are reading and enables you to verify the programs with different options. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online. Try the following example using our online compiler available at CodingGround

 For most of the examples given in this tutorial, you will find a Try it option in our website code sections at the top right corner that will take you to the online compiler. So just make use of it and enjoy your learning. It is very easy to setup and start using Bootstrap. This chapter will explain how to download and setup Bootstrap. We will also discuss the Bootstrap file structure, and demonstrate its usage with an example. Download Bootstrap You can download the latest version of Bootstrap from http://getbootstrap.com/. When you click on this link, you will get to see a screen as below ? Here you can see two buttons ? Download Bootstrap ? Clicking this, you can download the precompiled and minified versions of Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and fonts. No documentation or original source code files are included. Download Source ? Clicking this, you can get the latest Bootstrap LESS and JavaScript source code directly from GitHub. If you work with Bootstrap's uncompiled source code, you need to compile the LESS files to produce usable CSS files. For compiling LESS files into CSS, Bootstrap officially supports only Recess, which is Twitter's CSS hinter based on less.js. For better understanding and ease of use, we shall use precompiled version of Bootstrap throughout the tutorial. As the files are complied and minified you don't have to bother every time including separate files for individual functionality. At the time of writing this tutorial the latest version (Bootstrap 3) was downloaded. File structure Precompiled Bootstrap Once the compiled version Bootstrap is downloaded, extract the ZIP file, and you will see the following file/directory structure ? As you can see, there are compiled CSS and JS (bootstrap.*), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (bootstrap.min.*). Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as it is the optional Bootstrap theme. Bootstrap Source Code If you have downloaded the Bootstrap source code then the file structure would be as follows ? The files under less/, js/, and fonts/ are the source code for Bootstrap CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). The dist/ folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. docs-assets/, examples/, and all *.html files are Bootstrap documentation. HTML Template A basic HTML template using Bootstrap would look like this ? 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   
   <head>
      <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
      <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">
      
      <!-- Bootstrap -->
      <link href = "css/bootstrap.min.css" rel = "stylesheet">
      
      <!-- HTML5 Shim and Respond.js IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries -->
      <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// -->
      
      <!--[if lt IE 9]>
      <script src = "https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/html5shiv/3.7.0/html5shiv.js"></script>
      <script src = "https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.3.0/respond.min.js"></script>
      <![endif]-->
      
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

      <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
      <script src = "https://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script>
      
      <!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed -->
      <script src = "js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
      
   </body>
	
</html>
 Here you can see the jquery.js, bootstrap.min.js and bootstrap.min.css files that are included to make a normal HTM file to the Bootstrapped Template. Just make sure to include jQuery library before you include Bootstrap library. More details about each of the elements in this above piece of code will be discussed in the chapter Bootstrap CSS Overview. This template structure is already included as part of the Try it (online compiler) tool. Hence in all the examples (in the following chapters) of this tutorial you will only see the contents of the <body> element. Once you click on the Try it option available at the top right corner of example, and you will see the entire code. Example Now let's try an example using the above template. Try the following example using Try it option available at the top right corner of the below sample code box on our website ? 
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
 In all the subsequent chapters we have used dummy text from the site http://www.lipsum.com/. Bootstrap - Grid System In this chapter we shall discuss the Bootstrap Grid System. What is a Grid? As put by wikepedia ? In graphic design, a grid is a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal) lines used to structure the content. It is widely used to design layout and content structure in print design. In web design, it is a very effective method to create a consistent layout rapidly and effectively using HTML and CSS. To put in simple words, grids in web design organise and structure content, makes the websites easy to scan and reduces the cognitive load on users. What is Bootstrap Grid System? As put by the official documentation of Bootstrap for grid system ? Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts. Let us understand the above statement. Bootstrap 3 is mobile first in the sense that the code for Bootstrap now starts by targeting smaller screens like mobile devices, tablets, and then “expands” components and grids for larger screens such as laptops, desktops. Mobile First Strategy Content Determine what is most important. Layout Design to smaller widths first. Base CSS address mobile device first; media queries address for tablet, desktops. Progressive Enhancement Add elements as screen size increases. Working of Bootstrap Grid System Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works ? Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding. Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns. Content should be placed within the columns, and only columns may be the immediate children of rows. Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts. LESS mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts. Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and the last column via negative margin on .rows. Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4. Media Queries Media query is a really fancy term for "conditional CSS rule". It simply applies some CSS, based on certain conditions set forth. If those conditions are met, the style is applied. Media Queries in Bootstrap allow you to move, show and hide content based on the viewport size. Following media queries are used in LESS files to create the key breakpoints in the Bootstrap grid system. 
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-md-min) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-lg-min) { ... }
 Occasionally these are expanded to include a max-width to limit CSS to a narrower set of devices. 
@media (max-width: @screen-xs-max) { ... }
@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) and (max-width: @screen-sm-max) { ... }
@media (min-width: @screen-md-min) and (max-width: @screen-md-max) { ... }
@media (min-width: @screen-lg-min) { ... }
 Media queries have two parts, a device specification and then a size rule. In the above case, the following rule is set ? Let us consider this line ? 
@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) and (max-width: @screen-sm-max) { ... }
 For all devices no matter what kind with min-width: @screen-sm-min if the width of the screen gets smaller than @screen-sm-max, then do something. Grid options The following table summarizes aspects of how Bootstrap grid system works across multiple devices ? Extra small devices Phones (<768px) Small devices Tablets (?768px) Medium devices Desktops (?992px) Large devices Desktops (?1200px) Grid behavior Horizontal at all times Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints Collapsed to start, horizontal above breakpoints Max container width None (auto) 750px 970px 1170px Class prefix .col-xs- .col-sm- .col-md- .col-lg- # of columns 12 12 12 12 Max column width Auto 60px 78px 95px Gutter width 30px (15px on each side of a column) 30px (15px on each side of a column) 30px (15px on each side of a column) 30px (15px on each side of a column) Nestable Yes Yes Yes Yes Offsets Yes Yes Yes Yes Column ordering Yes Yes Yes Yes Basic Grid Structure Following is basic structure of Bootstrap grid ? 
<div class = "container">
   
   <div class = "row">
      <div class = "col-*-*"></div>
      <div class = "col-*-*"></div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "row">...</div>
	
</div>

<div class = "container">
   ....
</div>
 Let us see some simple grid examples ? Example ? Stacked-to-horizontal Example ? Medium and Large Device Example ? Mobile, tablet, desktops Responsive column resets With the four tiers of grids available, you are bound to run into issues where at certain breakpoints, the columns don't clear quite right as one is taller than the other. To fix that, use a combination of a class .clearfix and the responsive utility classes as shown in the following example ? 
<div class = "container">
   <div class = "row" >
   
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do 
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut 
            enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
            nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>
         
         <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do 
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "clearfix visible-xs"></div>
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco 
            laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do 
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut 
            enim ad minim</p>
      </div>
      
   </div>
</div>
 This will produce the following result ? Resize your viewport or check it out on your phone for a desired result of this example. Offset Columns Offsets are a useful feature for more specialized layouts. They can be used to push columns over for more spacing, (for example). The .col-xs = * classes don’t support offsets, but they are easily replicated by using an empty cell. To use offsets on large displays, use the .col-md-offset-* classes. These classes increase the left margin of a column by * columns where * range from 1 to 11. In the following example, we have <div class = "col-md-6">..</div>, We will center this using class .col-md-offset-3. 
<div class = "container">

   <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

   <div class = "row" >
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-md-offset-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8; 
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
      </div>

   </div>
	
</div>
 This will produce the following result ? Nesting columns To nest your content with the default grid, add a new .row and set of .col-md-* columns within an existing .col-md-* column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12. In the following example, the layout has two columns, with the second one being split into four boxes over two rows. 
<div class = "container">
   <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

   <div class = "row">

      <div class = "col-md-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8; 
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <h4>First Column</h4>
         <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "col-md-9" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <h4>Second Column- Split into 4 boxes</h4>
         <div class = "row">
            
            <div class = "col-md-6" style = "background-color: #B18904;
               box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">

 This will produce the following result ? Column Ordering Another nice feature of Bootstrap grid system is that you can easily write the columns in an order, and show them in another one. You can easily change the order of built-in grid columns with .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* modifier classes where * range from 1 to 11. In the following example we have two columns layout with left column being the narrowest and acting as a sidebar. We will swap the order of these columns using .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* classes. 
<div class = "container">
   <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
   
   <div class = "row">
      <p>Before Ordering</p>
      
      <div class = "col-md-4" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         I am on left
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-md-8" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         I am on right
      </div>
      
   </div>
	
   <br>
   
   <div class = "row">
      <p>After Ordering</p>
      
      <div class = "col-md-4 col-md-push-8" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         I was on left
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-md-8 col-md-pull-4" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         I was on right
      </div>

 This will produce the following result ? Bootstrap - CSS Overview This chapter provides an overview of the key pieces of Bootstrap's infrastructure, including Bootstrap's approach to better, faster, stronger web development. HTML5 doctype Bootstrap makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. Hence include the below piece of code for HTML5 doctype at the beginning of all your projects using Bootstrap. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   ....
</html>
 Mobile First Since Bootstrap 3 has been launched, Bootstrap has become mobile first. It means 'mobile first' styles can be found throughout the entire library instead of them in separate files. You need to add the viewport meta tag to the <head> element, to ensure proper rendering and touch zooming on mobile devices. 
<meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">
 width property controls the width of the device. Setting it to device-width will make sure that it is rendered across various devices (mobiles, desktops, tablets...) properly. initial-scale = 1.0 ensures that when loaded, your web page will be rendered at a 1:1 scale, and no zooming will be applied out of the box. Add user-scalable = no to the content attribute to disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices as shown below. Users are only able to scroll and not zoom with this change, and results in your site feeling a bit more like a native application. 
<meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0, maximum-scale = 1.0, user-scalable = no">
 Normally maximum-scale = 1.0 is used along with user-scalable = no. As mentioned above user-scalable = no may give users an experience more like a native app, hence Bootstrap doesn't recommend using this attribute. Responsive lmages Bootstrap 3 allows you to make the images responsive by adding a class .img-responsive to the <img> tag. This class applies max-width: 100%; and height: auto; to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element. 
<img src = "..." class = "img-responsive" alt = "Responsive image">
 Typography and Links Bootstrap sets a basic global display (background), typography, and link styles ? Basic Global display ? Sets background-color: #fff; on the <body> element. Typography ? Uses the @font-family-base, @font-size-base, and @line-height-base attributes as the typographic base. Link styles ? Sets the global link color via attribute @link-color and apply link underlines only on :hover. If you intend to use LESS code, you may find all these within scaffolding.less. Normalize Bootstrap uses Normalize to establish cross browser consistency. Normalize.css is a modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. It is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. Containers Use class .container to wrap a page's content and easily center the content's as shown below. 
<div class = "container">
   ...
</div>
 Take a look at the .container class in bootstrap.css file ? 
.container {
   padding-right: 15px;
   padding-left: 15px;
   margin-right: auto;
   margin-left: auto;
}
 Note that, due to padding and fixed widths, containers are not nestable by default. Take a look at bootstrap.css file ? 
@media (min-width: 768px) {
   .container {
      width: 750px;
   }
}
 Here you can see that CSS has media-queries for containers with width. This helps for applying responsiveness and within those the container class is modified accordingly to render the grid system properly. Bootstrap - Typography Bootstrap uses Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, and sans-serif in its default font stack. Using typography feature of Bootstrap you can create headings, paragraphs, lists and other inline elements. Let see learn each one of these in the following sections. Headings All HTML headings (h1 to h6) are styled in Bootstrap. An example is shown below ? 
<h1>I'm Heading1 h1</h1>
<h2>I'm Heading2 h2</h2>
<h3>I'm Heading3 h3</h3>
<h4>I'm Heading4 h4</h4>
<h5>I'm Heading5 h5</h5>
<h6>I'm Heading6 h6</h6>
 The above code segment with Bootstrap will produce following result ? Inline Subheadings To add an inline subheading to any of the headings, simply add <small> around any of the elements or add .small class and you will get smaller text in a lighter color as shown in the example below ? 
<h1>I'm Heading1 h1. <small>I'm secondary Heading1 h1</small></h1> 
<h2>I'm Heading2 h2. <small>I'm secondary Heading2 h2</small></h2>
<h3>I'm Heading3 h3. <small>I'm secondary Heading3 h3</small></h3>
<h4>I'm Heading4 h4. <small>I'm secondary Heading4 h4</small></h4>
<h5>I'm Heading5 h5. <small>I'm secondary Heading5 h5</small></h5>
<h6>I'm Heading6 h6. <small>I'm secondary Heading1 h6</small></h6>
 The above code segment with Bootstrap will produce following result ? Lead Body Copy To add some emphasis to a paragraph, add class = "lead". This will give you a larger font size, lighter weight, and a taller line height as in the following example ? 
<h2>Lead Example</h2>
<p class = "lead">This is an example paragraph demonstrating 
   the use of lead body copy. This is an example paragraph 
   demonstrating the use of lead body copy.This is an example 
   paragraph demonstrating the use of lead body copy.This is an 
   example paragraph demonstrating the use of lead body copy.
   This is an example paragraph demonstrating the use of lead body copy.</p>
 Emphasis HTML's default emphasis tags such as <small> sets text at 85% the size of the parent, <strong> emphasizes a text with heavier font-weight, and <em> emphasizes a text in italics. Bootstrap offers a few classes that can be used to provide emphasis on texts as seen in the following example ? 
<small>This content is within tag</small><br>
<strong>This content is within tag</strong><br>
<em>This content is within tag and is rendered as italics</em><br>

<p class = "text-left">Left aligned text.</p>
<p class = "text-center">Center aligned text.</p>
<p class = "text-right">Right aligned text.</p>
<p class = "text-muted">This content is muted</p>
<p class = "text-primary">This content carries a primary class</p>
<p class = "text-success">This content carries a success class</p>
<p class = "text-info">This content carries a info class</p>
<p class = "text-warning">This content carries a warning class</p>
<p class = "text-danger">This content carries a danger class</p>
 Abbreviations The HTML <abbr> element provides markup for abbreviations or acronyms, like WWW or HTTP. Bootstrap styles <abbr> elements with a light dotted border along the bottom and reveals the full text on hover (as long as you add that text to the <abbr> title attribute). To get a a slightly smaller font size add .initialism to <abbr>. 
<abbr title = "World Wide Web">WWW</abbr><br>
<abbr title = "Real Simple Syndication" class = "initialism">RSS</abbr>
 Addresses Using <address> tag you can display the contact information on your web page. Since the <address> defaults to display: block; you’ll need to use Tags to add line breaks to the enclosed address text. 
<address>
   <strong>Some Company, Inc.</strong><br>
   007 street<br>
   Some City, State XXXXX<br>
   <abbr title = "Phone">P:</abbr> (123) 456-7890
</address>

<address>
   <strong>Full Name</strong><br>
   <a href = "mailto:#">mailto@somedomain.com</a>
</address>
 Blockquotes You can use the default <blockquote> around any HTML text. Other options include, adding a <small> tag for identifying the source of the quote and right-aligning the blockquote using class .pull-right. The following example demonstrates all these features ? 
<blockquote>
   <p>This is a default blockquote example. This is a default 
      blockquote example. This is a default blockquote 
      example.This is a default blockquote example. This is a 
      default blockquote example.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   This is a blockquote with a source title.
   <small>Someone famous in <cite title = "Source Title">Source Title</cite></small>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class = "pull-right">This is a blockquote aligned to the right.
   <small>Someone famous in <cite title = "Source Title">Source Title</cite></small>
</blockquote>
 Lists Bootstrap supports ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists. Ordered lists ? An ordered list is a list that falls in some sort of sequential order and is prefaced by numbers. Unordered lists ? An unordered list is a list that doesn’t have any particular order and is traditionally styled with bullets. If you do not want the bullets to appear, then you can remove the styling by using the class .list-unstyled. You can also place all list items on a single line using the class .list-inline. Definition lists ? In this type of list, each list item can consist of both the <dt> and the <dd> elements. <dt> stands for definition term, and like a dictionary, this is the term (or phrase) that is being defined. Subsequently, the <dd> is the definition of the <dt>. You can make terms and descriptions in <dl> line up side-by-side using class dl-horizontal. The following example demonstrates each of these types ? 
<h4>Example of Ordered List</h4>
<ol>
   <li>Item 1</li>
   <li>Item 2</li>
   <li>Item 3</li>
   <li>Item 4</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example of UnOrdered List</h4>

<ul>
   <li>Item 1</li>
   <li>Item 2</li>
   <li>Item 3</li>
   <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example of Unstyled List</h4>

<ul class = "list-unstyled">
   <li>Item 1</li>
   <li>Item 2</li>
   <li>Item 3</li>
   <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example of Inline List</h4>

<ul class = "list-inline">
   <li>Item 1</li>
   <li>Item 2</li>
   <li>Item 3</li>
   <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example of Definition List</h4>

<dl>
   <dt>Description 1</dt>
   <dd>Item 1</dd>
   <dt>Description 2</dt>
   <dd>Item 2</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example of Horizontal Definition List</h4>

<dl class = "dl-horizontal">
   <dt>Description 1</dt>
   <dd>Item 1</dd>
   <dt>Description 2</dt>
   <dd>Item 2</dd>
</dl>
 Bootstrap - Code Bootstrap allows you to display code with two different key ways ? The first is the <code> tag. If you are going to be displaying code inline, you should use the <code> tag. Second is the <pre> tag. If the code needs to be displayed as a standalone block element or if it has multiple lines, then you should use the <pre> tag. Make sure that when you use the <pre> and <code> tags, you use the unicode variants for the opening and closing tags ? &lt; and &gt;. Let us see an example below ? 
<p><code>&lt;header&gt;</code> is wrapped as an inline element.</p>
<p>To display code as a standalone block element use &lt;pre&gt; tag as:</p>

<pre>
   &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Article Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/article&gt;
</pre>
 Bootstrap - Tables Bootstrap provides a clean layout for building tables. Some of the table elements supported by Bootstrap are ? Tag Description <table> Wrapping element for displaying data in a tabular format <thead> Container element for table header rows (<tr>) to label table columns. <tbody> Container element for table rows (<tr>) in the body of the table. <tr> Container element for a set of table cells (<td> or <th>) that appears on a single row. <td> Default table cell. <th> Special table cell for column (or row, depending on scope and placement) labels. Must be used within a <thead> <caption> Description or summary of what the table holds. Basic Table If you want a nice, basic table style with just some light padding and horizontal dividers, add the base class of .table to any table as shown in the following example ? 
<table class = "table">
   <caption>Basic Table Layout</caption>
   
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>City</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Tanmay</td>
         <td>Bangalore</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Sachin</td>
         <td>Mumbai</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
	
</table>
 Optional Table Classes Along with the base table markup and the .table class, there are a few additional classes that you can use to style the markup. Following sections will give you a glimpse of all these classes. Striped Table By adding the .table-striped class, you will get stripes on rows within the <tbody> as seen in the following example ? 
<table class = "table table-striped">
   <caption>Striped Table Layout</caption>
   
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>City</th>
         <th>Pincode</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Tanmay</td>
         <td>Bangalore</td>
         <td>560001</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Sachin</td>
         <td>Mumbai</td>
         <td>400003</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Uma</td>
         <td>Pune</td>
         <td>411027</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
   
</table>
 Bordered Table By adding the .table-bordered class, you will get borders surrounding every element and rounded corners around the entire table as seen in the following example ? 
<table class = "table table-bordered">
   <caption>Bordered Table Layout</caption>
   
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>City</th>
         <th>Pincode</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Tanmay</td>
         <td>Bangalore</td>
         <td>560001</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Sachin</td>
         <td>Mumbai</td>
         <td>400003</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Uma</td>
         <td>Pune</td>
         <td>411027</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
	
</table>
 Hover Table By adding the .table-hover class, a light gray background will be added to rows while the cursor hovers over them, as seen in the following example ? 
<table class = "table table-hover">
   <caption>Hover Table Layout</caption>
   
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>City</th>
         <th>Pincode</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Tanmay</td>
         <td>Bangalore</td>
         <td>560001</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Sachin</td>
         <td>Mumbai</td>
         <td>400003</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Uma</td>
         <td>Pune</td>
         <td>411027</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
   
</table>
 Condensed Table By adding the .table-condensed class, row padding is cut in half to condense the table. as seen in the following example. This is useful if you want any denser information. 
<table class = "table table-condensed">
   <caption>Condensed Table Layout</caption>
   
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>City</th>
         <th>Pincode</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Tanmay</td>
         <td>Bangalore</td>
         <td>560001</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Sachin</td>
         <td>Mumbai</td>
         <td>400003</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Uma</td>
         <td>Pune</td>
         <td>411027</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
   
</table>
 Contextual classes The Contextual classes shown in following table will allow you to change the background color of your table rows or individual cells. Class Description .active Applies the hover color to a particular row or cell .success Indicates a successful or positive action .warning Indicates a warning that might need attention .danger Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action These classes can be applied to <tr>, <td> or <th>. 
<table class = "table">
   <caption>Contextual Table Layout</caption>
   
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Product</th>
         <th>Payment Date</th>
         <th>Status</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   
   <tbody>
      <tr class = "active">
         <td>Product1</td>
         <td>23/11/2013</td>
         <td>Pending</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr class = "success">
         <td>Product2</td>
         <td>10/11/2013</td>
         <td>Delivered</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr class = "warning">
         <td>Product3</td>
         <td>20/10/2013</td>
         <td>In Call to confirm</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr class = "danger">
         <td>Product4</td>
         <td>20/10/2013</td>
         <td>Declined</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
   
</table>
 Responsive Tables By wrapping any .table in .table-responsive class, you will make the table scroll horizontally up to small devices (under 768px). When viewing on anything larger than 768px wide, you will not see any difference in these tables. 
<div class = "table-responsive">
   <table class = "table">
      
      <caption>Responsive Table Layout</caption>
      
      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Product</th>
            <th>Payment Date</th>
            <th>Status</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>
      
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>Product1</td>
            <td>23/11/2013</td>
            <td>Pending</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Product2</td>
            <td>10/11/2013</td>
            <td>Delivered</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Product3</td>
            <td>20/10/2013</td>
            <td>In Call to confirm</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Product4</td>
            <td>20/10/2013</td>
            <td>Declined</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
      
   </table>

 Bootstrap - Forms In this chapter, we will study how to create forms with ease using Bootstrap. Bootstrap makes it easy with the simple HTML markup and extended classes for different styles of forms. In this chapter we will study how to create forms with ease using Bootstrap. Form Layout Bootstrap provides you with following types of form layouts ? Vertical (default) form In-line form Horizontal form Vertical or Basic Form The basic form structure comes with Bootstrap; individual form controls automatically receive some global styling. To create a basic form do the following ? Add a role form to the parent <form> element. Wrap labels and controls in a <div> with class .form-group. This is needed for optimum spacing. Add a class of .form-control to all textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements. 
<form role = "form">

   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "name">Name</label>
      <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "name" placeholder = "Enter Name">
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "inputfile">File input</label>
      <input type = "file" id = "inputfile">
      <p class = "help-block">Example block-level help text here.</p>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "checkbox">
      <label><input type = "checkbox"> Check me out</label>
   </div>
   
   <button type = "submit" class = "btn btn-default">Submit</button>
</form>
 Inline Form To create a form where all of the elements are inline, left aligned and labels are alongside, add the class .form-inline to the <form> tag. 
<form class = "form-inline" role = "form">
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label class = "sr-only" for = "name">Name</label>
      <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "name" placeholder = "Enter Name">
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label class = "sr-only" for = "inputfile">File input</label>
      <input type = "file" id = "inputfile">
   </div>
   
   <div class = "checkbox">
      <label><input type = "checkbox"> Check me out</label>
   </div>
   
   <button type = "submit" class = "btn btn-default">Submit</button>
</form>
 By default inputs, selects, and textareas have 100% width in Bootstrap. You need to set a width on the form controls when using inline form. Using the class .sr-only you can hide the labels of the inline forms. Horizontal Form Horizontal forms stands apart from the others not only in the amount of markup, but also in the presentation of the form. To create a form that uses the horizontal layout, do the following ? Add a class of .form-horizontal to the parent <form> element. Wrap labels and controls in a <div> with class .form-group. Add a class of .control-label to the labels. 
<form class = "form-horizontal" role = "form">
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "firstname" class = "col-sm-2 control-label">First Name</label>
		
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "firstname" placeholder = "Enter First Name">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "lastname" class = "col-sm-2 control-label">Last Name</label>
		
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "lastname" placeholder = "Enter Last Name">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <div class = "col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
         <div class = "checkbox">
            <label><input type = "checkbox"> Remember me</label>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <div class = "col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
         <button type = "submit" class = "btn btn-default">Sign in</button>
      </div>
   </div>
	
</form>
 Supported Form Controls Bootstrap natively supports the most common form controls mainly input, textarea, checkbox, radio, and select. Inputs The most common form text field is the input field. This is where users will enter most of the essential form data. Bootstrap offers support for all native HTML5 input types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month, time, week, number, email, url, search, tel, and color. Proper type declaration is required to make Inputs fully styled. 
<form role = "form">
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "name">Label</label>
      <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Text input">
   </div>
  
</form>
 Textarea The textarea is used when you need multiple lines of input. Change rows attribute as necessary (fewer rows = smaller box, more rows = bigger box). 
<form role = "form">
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "name">Text Area</label>
      <textarea class = "form-control" rows = "3"></textarea>
   </div>
   
</form>
 CheckBoxes and Radio Buttons Checkboxes and radio buttons are great when you want users to choose from a list of preset options. When building a form, use checkbox if you want the user to select any number of options from a list. Use radio if you want to limit the user to just one selection. Use .checkbox-inline or .radio-inline class to a series of checkboxes or radios for controls appear on the same line. The following example demonstrates both (default and inline) types ? 
<label for = "name">Example of Default Checkbox and radio button </label>

<div class = "checkbox">
   <label>
      <input type = "checkbox" value = "">Option 1
   </label>
</div>

<div class = "checkbox">
   <label>
      <input type = "checkbox" value = "">Option 2
   </label>
</div>

<div class = "radio">
   <label>
      <input type = "radio" name = "optionsRadios" id = "optionsRadios1" value = "option1" checked> Option 1
   </label>
</div>

<div class = "radio">
   <label>
      <input type = "radio" name = "optionsRadios" id = "optionsRadios2" value = "option2">
      Option 2 - selecting it will deselect option 1
   </label>
</div>

<label for = "name">Example of Inline Checkbox and radio button </label>

<div>
   <label class = "checkbox-inline">
      <input type = "checkbox" id = "inlineCheckbox1" value = "option1"> Option 1
   </label>
   
   <label class = "checkbox-inline">
      <input type = "checkbox" id = "inlineCheckbox2" value = "option2"> Option 2
   </label>
   
   <label class = "checkbox-inline">
      <input type = "checkbox" id = "inlineCheckbox3" value = "option3"> Option 3
   </label>
   
   <label class = "checkbox-inline">
      <input type = "radio" name = "optionsRadiosinline" id = "optionsRadios3" value = "option1" checked> Option 1
   </label>
   
   <label class = "checkbox-inline">
      <input type = "radio" name = "optionsRadiosinline" id = "optionsRadios4" value = "option2"> Option 2
   </label>
</div>
 Selects A select is used when you want to allow the user to pick from multiple options, but by default it only allows one. Use <select> for list options with which the user is familiar, such as states or numbers. Use multiple = "multiple" to allow the users to select more than one option. The following example demonstrates both (select and multiple) types ? 
<form role = "form">
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "name">Select list</label>
      
      <select class = "form-control">
         <option>1</option>
         <option>2</option>
         <option>3</option>
         <option>4</option>
         <option>5</option>
      </select>

      <label for = "name">Mutiple Select list</label>
      
      <select multiple class = "form-control">
         <option>1</option>
         <option>2</option>
         <option>3</option>
         <option>4</option>
         <option>5</option>
      </select>
      
   </div>
	
</form>
 Static Control Use the class .form-control-static on a <p>, when you need to place plain text next to a form label within a horizontal form. 
<form class = "form-horizontal" role = "form">
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label class = "col-sm-2 control-label">Email</label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <p class = "form-control-static">email@example.com</p>
      </div>
      
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "inputPassword" class = "col-sm-2 control-label">Password</label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input type = "password" class = "form-control" id = "inputPassword" placeholder = "Password">
      </div>
      
   </div>
</form>
 Form Control States In addition to the :focus (i.e., a user clicks into the input or tabs onto it) state, Bootstrap offers styling for disabled inputs and classes for form validation. Input Focus When an input receives :focus, the outline of the input is removed and a box-shadow is applied. Disabled lnputs If you need to disable an input, simply adding the disabled attribute will not only disable it; it will also change the styling and the mouse cursor when the cursor hovers over the element. Disabled Fieldsets Add the disabled attribute to a <fieldset> to disable all the controls within the <fieldset> at once. Validation States Bootstrap includes validation styles for errors, warnings, and success messages. To use, simply add the appropriate class (.has-warning, .has-error, or .has-success) to the parent element. The following example demonstrates all the form control states ? 
<form class = "form-horizontal" role = "form">

   <div class = "form-group">
      <label class = "col-sm-2 control-label">Focused</label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input class = "form-control" id = "focusedInput" type = "text" value = "This is focused...">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <label for = "inputPassword" class = "col-sm-2 control-label">Disabled</label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input class = "form-control" id = "disabledInput" type = "text" placeholder = "Disabled input here..." disabled>
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <fieldset disabled>
      <div class = "form-group">
         
         <label for = "disabledTextInput"  class = "col-sm-2 control-label">
            Disabled input (Fieldset disabled)
         </label>
         
         <div class = "col-sm-10">
            <input type = "text" id = "disabledTextInput" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Disabled input">
         </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "form-group">
         <label for = "disabledSelect"  class = "col-sm-2 control-label">
            Disabled select menu (Fieldset disabled)
         </label>
         
         <div class = "col-sm-10">
            <select id = "disabledSelect" class = "form-control">
               <option>Disabled select</option>
            </select>
         </div>
         
      </div>
   </fieldset>
   
   <div class = "form-group has-success">
      <label class = "col-sm-2 control-label" for = "inputSuccess">
         Input with success
      </label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "inputSuccess">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group has-warning">
      <label class = "col-sm-2 control-label" for = "inputWarning">
         Input with warning
      </label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "inputWarning">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group has-error">
      <label class = "col-sm-2 control-label" for = "inputError">
         Input with error
      </label>
      
      <div class = "col-sm-10">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" id = "inputError">
      </div>
      
   </div>
	
</form>
 Form Control Sizing You can set heights and widths of forms using classes like .input-lg and .col-lg-* respectively. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<form role = "form">

   <div class = "form-group">
      <input class = "form-control input-lg" type = "text" placeholder =".input-lg">
   </div>

   <div class = "form-group">
      <input class = "form-control" type = "text" placeholder = "Default input">
   </div>

   <div class = "form-group">
      <input class = "form-control input-sm" type = "text" placeholder = ".input-sm">
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group"></div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <select class = "form-control input-lg">
         <option value = "">.input-lg</option>
      </select>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <select class = "form-control">
         <option value = "">Default select</option>
      </select>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "form-group">
      <select class = "form-control input-sm">
         <option value = "">.input-sm</option>
      </select>
   </div>

   <div class = "row">
      <div class = "col-lg-2">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = ".col-lg-2">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-lg-3">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = ".col-lg-3">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-lg-4">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = ".col-lg-4">
      </div>
      
   </div>
</form>
 Help Text Bootstrap form controls can have a block level help text that flows with the inputs. To add a full width block of content, use the .help-block after the <input>. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<form role = "form">
   <span>Example of Help Text</span>
   <input class = "form-control" type = "text" placeholder = "">
   
   <span class = "help-block">
      A longer block of help text that breaks onto a new line and may extend beyond one line.
   </span>
	
</form>
 Bootstrap - Buttons This chapter covers the use age of Bootstrap button with examples. Anything that is given a class of .btn will inherit the default look of a gray button with rounded corners. However, Bootstrap provides some options to style buttons, which are summarized in the following table ? Class Description btn Default/ Standard button. btn-primary Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons. btn-success Indicates a successful or positive action. btn-info Contextual button for informational alert messages. btn-warning Indicates caution should be taken with this action. btn-danger Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action. btn-link Deemphasize a button by making it look like a link while maintaining button behavior. The following example demonstrates all the above button classes ? 
<!-- Standard button -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Default Button</button>

<!-- Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>

<!-- Indicates a successful or positive action -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-success">Success Button</button>

<!-- Contextual button for informational alert messages -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-info">Info Button</button>

<!-- Indicates caution should be taken with this action -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-warning">Warning Button</button>

<!-- Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-danger">Danger Button</button>

<!-- Deemphasize a button by making it look like a link while maintaining button behavior -->
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-link">Link Button</button>
 Button Size The following table summarizes the classes used to get buttons of various sizes ? Class Description .btn-lg This makes the button size large. .btn-sm This makes the button size small. .btn-xs This makes the button size extra small. .btn-block This creates block level buttons—those that span the full width of a parent. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg">
      Large Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg">
      Large button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary">
      Default size Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">
      Default size button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-sm">
      Small Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-sm">
      Small button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-xs">
      Extra small Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-xs">
      Extra small button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">
      Block level Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg btn-block">
      Block level button
   </button>
</p>
 Button State Bootstrap provides classes which allow you to change the state of buttons as active, disabled etc. each of which are discussed in the following sections. Active State Buttons will appear pressed (with a darker background, darker border, and inset shadow) when active. The following table summarizes classes used to make button elements and anchor elements active ? Element Class Button element Use .active class to show that it is activated. Anchor element Use .active class to <a> buttons to show that it is activated. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg ">
      Default Button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg active">
      Active Button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg">
      Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg active">
      Active Primary button
   </button>
</p>
 Disabled State When you disable a button, it will fade in color by 50%, and lose the gradient. The following table summarizes classes used to make button element and anchor element disabled ? Element Class Button element Add the disabled attribute to <button> buttons. Anchor element Add the disabled class to <a> buttons. Note ? This class will only change the <a>'s appearance, not its functionality. You need to use custom JavaScript to disable links here. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg">
      Default Button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg" disabled = "disabled">
      Disabled Button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg">
      Primary button
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg" disabled = "disabled">
      Disabled Primary button
   </button>
</p>

<p>
   <a href = "#" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg" role = "button">
      Link
   </a>
   
   <a href = "#" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg disabled" role = "button">
      Disabled Link
   </a>
</p>

<p>
   <a href = "#" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg" role = "button">
      Primary link
   </a>
   
   <a href = "#" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg disabled" role = "button">
      Disabled Primary link
   </a>
</p>
 Button Tags You may use button classes with <a>, <button>, or <input> element. But it is recommended that you use it with <button> elements mostly to avoid cross browser inconsistency issues. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<a class = "btn btn-default" href = "#" role = "button">Link</a>
<button class = "btn btn-default" type = "submit">Button</button>
<input class = "btn btn-default" type = "button" value = "Input">
<input class = "btn btn-default" type = "submit" value = "Submit">
 Bootstrap - Images This chapter covers the Bootstrap support for images. Bootstrap provides three classes that can be used to apply some simple styles to images ? .img-rounded ? adds border-radius:6px to give the image rounded corners. .img-circle ? makes the entire image round by adding border-radius:500px. .img-thumbnail ? adds a bit of padding and a gray border ? The following example demonstrates this ? 
<img src = "/bootstrap/images/download.png" class = "img-rounded">

<img src = "/bootstrap/images/download.png" class = "img-circle">

<img src = "/bootstrap/images/download.png" class = "img-thumbnail">
 Bootstrap - Helper Classes This chapter discusses some of the helper classes in Bootstrap that might come in handy. Close icon Use the generic close icon for dismissing content like modals and alerts. Use the class close to get the close icon. 
<p>Close Icon Example
   <button type = "button" class = "close" aria-hidden = "true">
      &times;
   </button>
</p>
 Carets Use carets to indicate dropdown functionality and direction. To get this functionality use the class caret with a <span> element. 
<p>Caret Example<span class = "caret"></span></p>


 Quick Floats You can float an element to the left or right with class pull-left or pull-right respectively the following example demonstrates this. 
<div class = "pull-left">Quick Float to left</div>

<div class = "pull-right">Quick Float to right</div>
 To align components in navbars with utility classes, use .navbar-left or .navbar-right instead. See the navbar chapter for details. Center Content Blocks Use class center-block to set an element to center. 
<div class = "row">
   <div class = "center-block" style = "width:200px; background-color:#ccc;">
      This is an example for center-block
   </div>
</div>
 Clearfix To clear the float of any element, use the .clearfix class. 
<div class = "clearfix" style = "background: #D8D8D8;border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px;">
   
   <div class = "pull-left" style = "background:#58D3F7;">
      Quick Float to left
   </div>
   
   <div class = "pull-right" style = "background: #DA81F5;">
      Quick Float to right
   </div>
   
</div>
 Showing and Hiding Content You can force an element to be shown or hidden (including for screen readers) with the use of classes .show and .hidden. 
<div class = "row" style = "padding: 91px 100px 19px 50px;">
   
   <div class = "show" style = "left-margin:10px; width:300px; background-color:#ccc;">
      This is an example for show class
   </div>
   
   <div class = "hidden" style = "width:200px; background-color:#ccc;">
      This is an example for hide class
   </div>
   
</div>
 Screen Reader Content You can hide an element to all devices except screen readers with the class .sr-only. 
<div class = "row" style = "padding: 91px 100px 19px 50px;">
   <form class = "form-inline" role = "form">
      
      <div class = "form-group">
         <label class = "sr-only" for = "email">Email address</label>
         <input type = "email" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Enter email">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "form-group">
         <label class = "sr-only" for = "pass">Password</label>
         <input type = "password" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Password">
      </div>
      
   </form>
</div>
 Here we can see that the label of both the input types is assigned the class sr-only, hence labels will be visible to only screen readers. Bootstrap - Responsive utilities Bootstrap provides some handful helper classes, for faster mobile-friendly development. These can be used for showing and hiding content by device via media query, combined with large, small, and medium devices. Use these sparingly and avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site. Responsive utilities are currently only available for block and table toggling. Classes Devices .visible-xs Extra small (less than 768px) visible .visible-sm Small (up to 768 px) visible .visible-md Medium (768 px to 991 px) visible .visible-lg Larger (992 px and above) visible .hidden-xs Extra small (less than 768px) hidden .hidden-sm Small (up to 768 px) hidden .hidden-md Medium (768 px to 991 px) hidden .hidden-lg Larger (992 px and above) hidden Print Classes The following table lists the print classes. Use these for toggling the content for print. Classes Print .visible-print Yes Visible .hidden-print Visible only to browser not to print. Example The following example demonstrates the use of above listed helper classes. Resize your browser or load the example on different devices to test the responsive utility classes. 
<div class = "container" style = "padding: 40px;">
   <div class = "row visible-on">
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <span class = "hidden-xs">Extra small</span>
         <span class = "visible-xs">? Visible on x-small</span>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <span class = "hidden-sm">Small</span>
         <span class = "visible-sm">? Visible on small</span>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "clearfix visible-xs"></div>
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <span class = "hidden-md">Medium</span>
         <span class = "visible-md">? Visible on medium</span>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "col-xs-6 col-sm-3" style = "background-color: #dedef8;
         box-shadow: inset 1px -1px 1px #444, inset -1px 1px 1px #444;">
         
         <span class = "hidden-lg">Large</span>
         <span class = "visible-lg">? Visible on large</span>
      </div>
      
  </div>  
</div>
 Checkmarks indicates that the element is visible in your current viewport. Bootstrap - Glyphicons This chapter will discuss about Glyphicons, its use and some examples. Bootstrap bundles 200 glyphs in font format. Let us now understand what Glyphicons are. What are Glyphicons? Glyphicons are icon fonts which you can use in your web projects. Glyphicons Halflings are not free and require licensing, however their creator has made them available for Bootstrap projects free of cost. "It is recommended, as a thank you, we ask you to include an optional link back to GLYPHICONS whenever practical". — Bootstrap Documentation Where to find Glyphicons? Now that we have downloaded Bootstrap 3.x version and understand its directory structure from the chapter Environment Setup, glyphicons can be found within the fonts folder. This contains the following files ? glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff Associated CSS rules are present within bootstrap.css and bootstrap-min.css files within css folder of dist folder. You can see the available glyphicons at this link GLYPHICONS. Usage To use the icons, simply use the following code just about anywhere in your code. Leave a space between the icon and text for proper padding. 
<span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span>
 The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">
      <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-sort-by-attributes"></span>
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">
      <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-sort-by-attributes-alt"></span>
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">
      <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-sort-by-order"></span>
   </button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">
      <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-sort-by-order-alt"></span>
   </button>
</p>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-lg">
   <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>
   
   User
</button>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default btn-sm">
   <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> 
   
   User
</button>

<button type ="button" class = "btn btn-default btn-xs">
   <span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> 
   
   User
</button>
 Bootstrap - Dropdowns This chapter will highlight about Bootstrap dropdown menus. Dropdown menus are toggleable, contextual menus for displaying links in a list format. This can be made interactive with the dropdown JavaScript plugin. To use dropdown, just wrap the dropdown menu within the class .dropdown.The following example demonstrates a basic dropdown menu ? 
<div class = "dropdown">
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn dropdown-toggle" id = "dropdownMenu1" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Topics
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu" aria-labelledby = "dropdownMenu1">
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">Java</a>
      </li>
      
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">Data Mining</a>
      </li>
      
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">
            Data Communication/Networking
         </a>
      </li>
      
      <li role = "presentation" class = "divider"></li>
      
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">Separated link</a>
      </li>
   </ul>
   
</div>
 Options Alignment Align the dropdown menu to right by adding the class .pull-right to .dropdown-menu. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "dropdown">
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn dropdown-toggle" id = "dropdownMenu1" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Topics
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu pull-right" role = "menu" aria-labelledby = "dropdownMenu1">
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">Java</a>
      </li>
      
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">Data Mining</a>
      </li>
      
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">
            Data Communication/Networking
         </a>
      </li>
      
      <li role = "presentation" class = "divider"></li>
      
      <li role = "presentation">
         <a role = "menuitem" tabindex = "-1" href = "#">Separated link</a>
      </li>
   </ul>
   
</div>
 Headers You can add a header to label sections of actions in any dropdown menu by using the class dropdown-header. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "dropdown">
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn dropdown-toggle" id = "dropdownMenu1" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Topics
      <span class = "caret"></span>

 Bootstrap - Button Groups Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line. This is useful when you want to place items like alignment buttons together. You can add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with Bootstrap Button Plugin. Following table summarizes the important classes Bootstrap provides to use button groups ? Class Description Code Sample .btn-group This class is used for a basic button group. Wrap a series of buttons with class .btn in .btn-group. 
<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button1</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button2</button>
</div>
 .btn-toolbar This helps to combine sets of <div class = "btn-group"> into a <div class = "btn-toolbar"> for more complex components. 
<div class = "btn-toolbar" role = "toolbar">
   <div class = "btn-group">...</div>
   <div class = "btn-group">...</div>
</div> .btn-group-lg, .btn-group-sm, .btn-group-xs These classes can be applied to button group instead of resizing each button. 
<div class = "btn-group btn-group-lg">...</div>
<div class = "btn-group btn-group-sm">...</div>
<div class = "btn-group btn-group-xs">...</div>
 .btn-group-vertical This class make a set of buttons appear vertically stacked rather than horizontally. 
<div class = "btn-group-vertical">
   ...
</div> Basic Button Group The following example demonstrates the use of class .btn-group discussed in the above table ? 
<div class = "btn-group">
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 1</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 2</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 3</button>
   
</div>
 Button Toolbar The following example demonstrates the use of class .btn-toolbar discussed in the above table ? 
<div class = "btn-toolbar" role = "toolbar">
   
   <div class = "btn-group">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 1</button>
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 2</button>
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 3</button>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "btn-group">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 4</button>
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 5</button>
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 6</button>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "btn-group">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 7</button>
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 8</button>
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 9</button>
   </div>
   
</div>
 Button Size The following example demonstrates the use of class .btn-group-* discussed in the above table ? 
<div class = "btn-group btn-group-lg">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 1</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 2</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 3</button>
</div>

<div class = "btn-group btn-group-sm">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 4</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 5</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 6</button>
</div>

<div class = "btn-group btn-group-xs">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 7</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 8</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 9</button>
</div>
 Nesting You can nest button groups within another button group i.e, place a .btn-group within another .btn-group . This is done when you want dropdown menus mixed with a series of buttons. 
<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 1</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 2</button>
   
   <div class = "btn-group">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
         Dropdown
         <span class = "caret"></span>
      </button>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
         <li><a href = "#">Dropdown link 1</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Dropdown link 2</a></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
  
</div>
 Vertical Buttongroup The following example demonstrates the use of class .btn-group-vertical discussed in the above table ? 
<div class = "btn-group-vertical">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 1</button>
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Button 2</button>
   
   <div class = "btn-group-vertical">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
         Dropdown
         <span class = "caret"></span>
      </button>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
         <li><a href = "#">Dropdown link 1</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Dropdown link 2</a></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
  
</div>
 Bootstrap - Button Dropdowns This chapter will discuss about how to add dropdown menu to buttons using Bootstrap classes. To add a dropdown to a button, simply wrap the button and dropdown menu in a .btn-group. You can also use <span class = "caret"></span> to act as an indicator that the button is a dropdown. The following example demonstrates a basic single button dropdowns ? 
<div class = "btn-group">
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Default 
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>

<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Primary 
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
   
</div>
 Split Button Dropdowns Split button dropdowns use the same general style as the dropdown button but add a primary action along with the dropdown. Split buttons have the primary action on the left and a toggle on the right that displays the dropdown. 
<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default">Default</button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      <span class = "caret"></span>
      <span class = "sr-only">Toggle Dropdown</span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>

<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      <span class = "caret"></span>
      <span class = "sr-only">Toggle Dropdown</span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>
 Button Dropdown Size You can use the dropdowns with any button size ? .btn-large, .btn-sm, or .btn-xs. 
<div class = "btn-group">
   
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle btn-lg" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Default
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>

<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle btn-sm" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Primary
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
</div>

<div class = "btn-group">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-success dropdown-toggle btn-xs" data-toggle = "dropdown">
      Success
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </button>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
      <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
      
      <li class = "divider"></li>
      <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
   </ul>
   
</div>
 Dropup Variation Menus can also be built to drop up rather than down. To achieve this, simply add .dropup to the parent .btn-group container. 
<div class = "row" style = "margin-left:50px; margin-top:200px">
   
   <div class = "btn-group dropup">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
         Default
         <span class = "caret"></span>
      </button>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
         <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
         
         <li class = "divider"></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "btn-group dropup">
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
         Primary
         <span class = "caret"></span>
      </button>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu">
         <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
         
         <li class = "divider"></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
      </ul>
   </div>

 Bootstrap - Input Groups This chapter explains about one more feature Bootstrap supports, the Input Groups. Input groups are extended Form Controls. Using input groups you can easily prepend and append text or buttons to the text-based inputs. By adding prepended and appended content to an input field, you can add common elements to the user’s input. For example, you can add the dollar symbol, the @ for a Twitter username, or anything else that might be common for your application interface. To prepend or append elements to a .form-control? Wrap it in a <div> with class .input-group As a next step, within that same <div> , place your extra content inside a <span> with class .input-group-addon. Now place this <span> either before or after the <input> element. For cross browser compatibility, avoid using <select> elements here as they cannot be fully styled in WebKit browsers. Also do not apply input group classes directly to form groups. An input group is an isolated component. Basic Input Group The following example demonstrates basic input group ? 
<div style = "padding: 100px 100px 10px;">
   
   <form class = "bs-example bs-example-form" role = "form">
      <div class = "input-group">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">@</span>
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "twitterhandle">
      </div>
		
      <br>

      <div class = "input-group">
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">.00</span>
      </div>
		
      <br>
      
      <div class = "input-group">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">$</span>
         <input type = "text" class =" form-control">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">.00</span>
      </div>
   </form>
   
</div>
 Input Group Sizing You can change the size of the input groups, by adding the relative form sizing classes like .input-group-lg, input-group-sm, input-group-xs to the .input-group itself. The contents within will automatically resize. Following examples demonstrates this ? 
<div style = "padding: 100px 100px 10px;">
   
   <form class = "bs-example bs-example-form" role = "form">
      <div class = "input-group input-group-lg">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">@</span>
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Twitterhandle">
      </div>
		
      <br>

      <div class = "input-group">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">@</span>
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Twitterhandle">
      </div>
		
      <br>

      <div class = "input-group input-group-sm">
         <span class = "input-group-addon">@</span>
         <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Twitterhandle">
      </div>
   </form>
   
</div>
 Checkboxes and Radio Addons You can preappend or append radio buttons and checkboxes instead of text as demonstrated in the following example ? 
<div style = "padding: 100px 100px 10px;">
   
   <form class = "bs-example bs-example-form" role = "form">
      <div class = "row">
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               
               <span class = "input-group-addon">
                  <input type = "checkbox">
               </span>
               
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 --><br>
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               
               <span class = "input-group-addon">
                  <input type = "radio">
               </span>
               
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 -->
         
      </div><!-- /.row -->
   </form>
   
</div>
 Button Addons You can even preappend or append buttons in input groups. Instead of .input-group-addon class, you'll need to use class .input-group-btn to wrap the buttons. This is required due to the default browser styles that cannot be overridden. Following examples demonstrates this ? 
<div style = "padding: 100px 100px 10px;">
   
   <form class = "bs-example bs-example-form" role = "form">
      <div class = "row">
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               
               <span class = "input-group-btn">
                  <button class = "btn btn-default" type = "button">
                     Go!
                  </button>
               </span>
					
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
               
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 --><br>
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
               
               <span class = "input-group-btn">
                  <button class = "btn btn-default" type = "button">
                     Go!
                  </button>
               </span>
               
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 -->
         
      </div><!-- /.row -->
   </form>
   
</div>
 Buttons with Dropdowns Adding buttons with dropdown menus in input groups can be done by simply wrapping the button and dropdown menu in a .input-group-btn class as demonstrated in the following example ? 
<div style = "padding: 100px 100px 10px;">
   
   <form class = "bs-example bs-example-form" role = "form">
      <div class = "row">
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               
               <div class = "input-group-btn">
                  <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" 
                     data-toggle = "dropdown">
                     DropdownMenu 
                     <span class = "caret"></span>
                  </button>
                  
                  <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
                     <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
                     
                     <li class = "divider"></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
                  </ul>
               </div><!-- /btn-group -->
               
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 --><br>
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
               <div class = "input-group-btn">
                  
                  <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" 
                     data-toggle = "dropdown">
                     DropdownMenu 
                     <span class = "caret"></span>
                  </button>
                  
                  <ul class = "dropdown-menu pull-right">
                     <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
                     
                     <li class = "divider"></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
                  </ul>
               </div><!-- /btn-group -->
               
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 -->
         
      </div><!-- /.row -->
   </form>
   
</div>
 Segmented Buttons To segment button dropdowns in input groups, use the same general style as the dropdown button, but add a primary action along with the dropdown as can be seen in the following example ? 
<div style = "padding: 100px 100px 10px;">
   
   <form class = "bs-example bs-example-form" role = "form">
      <div class = "row">
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               
               <div class = "input-group-btn">
                  <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" 
                     tabindex = "-1">Dropdown Menu</button>
                  
                  <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" 
                     data-toggle = "dropdown" tabindex = "-1">
                     <span class = "caret"></span>
                     <span class = "sr-only">Toggle Dropdown</span>
                  </button>
                  
                  <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
                     <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
                     <li><a href ="#">Another action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
                     
                     <li class = "divider"></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  
               </div><!-- /btn-group -->
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
               
            </div><!-- /input-group -->
         </div><!-- /.col-lg-6 --><br>
         
         <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <div class = "input-group">
               <input type = "text" class = "form-control">
               <div class = "input-group-btn">
                  
                  <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" tabindex = "-1">
                     Dropdown Menu
                  </button>
                  
                  <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" 
                     data-toggle = "dropdown" tabindex = "-1">
                     
                     <span class = "caret"></span>
                     <span class = "sr-only">Toggle Dropdown</span>
                  </button>
                  
                  <ul class = "dropdown-menu pull-right">
                     <li><a href = "#">Action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Another action</a></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Something else here</a></li>
                     
                     <li class = "divider"></li>
                     <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
                  </ul>
               
               </div><!-- /btn-group -->

 Bootstrap - Navigation Elements Bootstrap provides a few different options for styling navigation elements. All of them share the same markup and base class, .nav. Bootstrap also provides a helper class, to share markup and states. Swap modifier classes to switch between each style. Tabular Navigation or Tabs To create a tabbed navigation menu ? Start with a basic unordered list with the base class of .nav Add class .nav-tabs. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>Tabs Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-tabs">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
 Pills Navigation Basic Pills To turn the tabs into pills, follow the same steps as above, use the class .nav-pills instead of .nav-tabs. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>Pills Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
 Vertical Pills You can stack the pills vertically using the class .nav-stacked along with the classes ? .nav, .nav-pills. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>Vertical Pills Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills nav-stacked">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
 Justified Nav You can make tabs or pills of equal widths as of their parent at screens wider than 768px using class .nav-justified along with .nav, .nav-tabs or .nav, .nav-pills respectively. On smaller screens, the nav links are stacked. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<p>Justified Nav Elements Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills nav-justified">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<ul class = "nav nav-tabs nav-justified">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
 Disabled Links For each of the .nav classes, if you add the .disabled class, it will create a gray link that also disables the :hover state as shown in the following example ? 
<p>Disabled Link Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   
   <li class = "disabled"><a href = "#">iOS(disabled link)</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<ul class = "nav nav-tabs">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   
   <li class = "disabled"><a href = "#">VB.Net(disabled link)</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>	
 This class will only change the <a>'s appearance, not its functionality. Use custom JavaScript to disable links here. Dropdowns Navigation menus share a similar syntax with dropdown menus. By default, you have a list item that has an anchor working in conjunction with some data-attributes to trigger an unordered list with a .dropdown-menu class. Tabs with Dropdowns To add dropdowns to tab ? Start with a basic unordered list with the base class of .nav Add the class .nav-tabs. Now add an unordered list with a .dropdown-menu class. 
<p>Tabs With Dropdown Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-tabs">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   
   <li class = "dropdown">
      <a class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown" href = "#">
         Java 
         <span class = "caret"></span>
      </a>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
         <li><a href = "#">Swing</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">jMeter</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
         <li class = "divider"></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
      </ul>
      
   </li>
	
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
 Pills with Dropdowns To do the same thing with pills, simply swap the .nav-tabs class with .nav-pills as shown in the following example. 
<p>Pills With Dropdown Example</p>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">VB.Net</a></li>
   
   <li class = "dropdown">
      <a class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown" href = "#">
         Java <span class = "caret"></span>
      </a>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
         <li><a href = "#">Swing</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">jMeter</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
         
         <li class = "divider"></li>
         <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
      </ul>
      
   </li>
	
   <li><a href = "#">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
 Bootstrap - Navbar The navbar is one of the prominent features of Bootstrap sites. Navbars are responsive 'meta' components that serve as navigation headers for your application or site. Navbars collapse in mobile views and become horizontal as the available viewport width increases. At its core, the navbar includes styling for site names and basic navigation. Default Navbar To create a default navbar ? Add the classes .navbar, .navbar-default to the <nav> tag. Add role = "navigation" to the above element, to help with accessibility. Add a header class .navbar-header to the <div> element. Include an <a> element with class navbar-brand. This will give the text a slightly larger size. To add links to the navbar, simply add an unordered list with the classes of .nav, .navbar-nav. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
			
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java 
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
			
      </ul>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Responsive Navbar To add responsive features to the navbar, the content that you want to be collapsed needs to be wrapped in a <div> with classes .collapse, .navbar-collapse. The collapsing nature is tripped by a button that has the class of .navbar-toggle and then features two data- elements. The first, data-toggle, is used to tell the JavaScript what to do with the button, and the second, data-target, indicates which element to toggle. Then with a class .icon-bar create what we like to call the hamburger button. This will toggle the elements that are in the .nav-collapse <div>. For this feature to work, you need to include the Bootstrap Collapse Plugin. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <button type = "button" class = "navbar-toggle" 
         data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#example-navbar-collapse">
         <span class = "sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
         <span class = "icon-bar"></span>
         <span class = "icon-bar"></span>
         <span class = "icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
		
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "collapse navbar-collapse" id = "example-navbar-collapse">
	
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
			
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java 
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
			
      </ul>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Forms in Navbar Instead of using the default class-based forms from Chapter Bootstrap Forms, forms that are in the navbar, use the .navbar-form class. This ensures that the form’s proper vertical alignment and collapsed behavior in narrow viewports. Use the alignment options (explained in Component alignment section) to decide where it resides within the navbar content. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <form class = "navbar-form navbar-left" role = "search">
         
         <div class = "form-group">
            <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Search">
         </div>
         <button type = "submit" class = "btn btn-default">Submit</button>
         
      </form>    
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Buttons in Navbar You can add buttons using class .navbar-btn to <button> elements not residing in a <form> to vertically center them in the navbar. .navbar-btn can be used on <a> and <input> elements. Do not use .navbar-btn nor the standard button classes on <a> elements within .navbar-nav. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <form class = "navbar-form navbar-left" role = "search">
         
         <div class = "form-group">
            <input type = "text" class = "form-control" placeholder = "Search">
         </div>
			
         <button type = "submit" class = "btn btn-default">Submit Button</button>
         
      </form>  
		
      <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default navbar-btn">Navbar Button</button>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Text in Navbar To wrap strings of text in an element use the class .navbar-text. This is usually used with <p> tag for proper leading and color. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <p class = "navbar-text">Signed in as Thomas</p>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Non-nav Links If you want to use the standard links that are not within the regular navbar navigation component, then use the class navbar-link to add proper colors for the default and inverse navbar options as shown in the following example ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <p class = "navbar-text navbar-right">
         Signed in as 
         <a href = "#" class = "navbar-link">Thomas</a>
      </p>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Component Alignment You can align the components like nav links, forms, buttons, or text to left or right in a navbar using the utility classes .navbar-left or .navbar-right. Both classes will add a CSS float in the specified direction. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      
      <!--Left Align-->
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav navbar-left">
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java 
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
      
      <form class = "navbar-form navbar-left" role = "search">
         <button type = "submit" class = "btn btn-default">Left align-Submit Button</button>
      </form> 
      
      <p class = "navbar-text navbar-left">Left align-Text</p>
      
      <!--Right Align-->
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java 
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>

   </div>
   
</nav>
 Fixed to Top The Bootstrap navbar can be dynamic in its positioning. By default, it is a block-level element that takes its positioning based on its placement in the HTML. With a few helper classes, you can place it either on the top or bottom of the page, or you can make it scroll statically with the page. If you want the navbar fixed to the top, add class .navbar-fixed-top to the .navbar class. The following example demonstrates this ? To prevent the navbar from sitting on top of other content in the body of the page, add at least 50 pixels of padding to the <body> tag or try your own values. 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
         
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Fixed to Bottom If you want the navbar fixed to the bottom of the page, add class .navbar-fixed-bottom to the .navbar class. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-bottom" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">SVN</a></li>
         
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java
               <b class ="caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Static Top To create a navbar that scrolls with the page, add the .navbar-static-top class. This class does not require adding the padding to the <body>. 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default navbar-static-top" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
         
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
				
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Inverted Navbar To create an inverted navbar with a black background and with white text, simply add the .navbar-inverse class to the .navbar class as demonstrated in the following example ? To prevent the navbar from sitting on top of other content in the body of the page, add at least 50 pixels of padding to the <body> tag or try your own values. 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-inverse" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Separated link</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#">One more separated link</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   
</nav>
 Bootstrap - Breadcrumb Breadcrumbs are a great way to show hierarchy-based information for a site. In the case of blogs, breadcrumbs can show the dates of publishing, categories, or tags. They indicate the current page's location within a navigational hierarchy. A breadcrumb in Bootstrap is simply an unordered list with a class of .breadcrumb. The separator is automatically added by CSS (bootstrap.min.css) through the following class ? 
.breadcrumb > li + li:before {
   color: #CCCCCC;
   content: "/ ";
   padding: 0 5px;
}
 The following example demonstrates breadcrumbs ? 
<ol class = "breadcrumb">
   <li><a href = "#">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">2013</a></li>
   <li class = "active">November</li>
</ol>
 Bootstrap - Pagination This chapter discusses about the pagination feature that Bootstrap supports. Pagination, an unordered list is handled by Bootstrap like a lot of other interface elements. Pagination The following table lists the classes that Bootstrap provides to handle pagination. Class Description Sample code .pagination Add this class to get the pagination on your page. 
<ul class = "pagination">
   <li><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">1</a></li>
   .......
</ul>
 .disabled, .active You can customize links by using .disabled for unclickable links and .active to indicate the current page. 
<ul class = "pagination">
   <li class = "disabled"><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">1<span class = "sr-only">(current)</span></a></li>
   .......
</ul>
 .pagination-lg, .pagination-sm Use these classes to get different size items. 
<ul class = "pagination pagination-lg">...</ul>
<ul class = "pagination">...</ul>
<ul class = "pagination pagination-sm">...</ul>
 Default Pagination The following example demonstrates the use of class .pagination discussed in the above table ? 
<ul class = "pagination">
   <li><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">1</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">2</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">3</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">4</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">5</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">&raquo;</a></li>
</ul>
 States The following example demonstrates the use of class .disabled, .active discussed in the above table ? 
<ul class = "pagination">
   <li><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">1</a></li>
   <li class = "disabled"><a href = "#">2</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">3</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">4</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">5</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">&raquo;</a></li>
</ul>
 Sizing The following example demonstrates the use of classes for sizing, .pagination-* discussed in the above table ? 
<ul class = "pagination pagination-lg">
   <li><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">1</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">2</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">3</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">4</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">5</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">&raquo;</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul class = "pagination">
   <li><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">1</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">2</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">3</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">4</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">5</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">&raquo;</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul class = "pagination pagination-sm">
   <li><a href = "#">&laquo;</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">1</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">2</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">3</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">4</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">5</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">&raquo;</a></li>
</ul>
 Pager If you need to create simple pagination links that go beyond text, the pager can work quite well. Like the pagination links, the pager is an unordered list. By default the links are centered. The following table lists the classes Bootstrap provides for pager. Class Description Sample code .pager Add this class to get the pager links. 
<ul class = "pager">
   <li><a href = "#">Previous</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Next</a></li>
</ul>
 .previous, .next Use class .previous to left align and .next to right-align the links. 
<ul class = "pager">
   <li class = "previous"><a href = "#">&larr; Older</a></li>
   <li class = "next"><a href = "#">Newer &rarr;</a></li>
</ul>
 .disabled Add this class to get a muted look. 
<ul class = "pager">
   <li class = "previous disabled"><a href = "#">&larr; Older</a></li>
   <li class = "next"><a href = "#">Newer &rarr;</a></li>
</ul>
 Default Pager The following example demonstrates the use of class .pager discussed in the above table ? 
<ul class = "pager">
   <li><a href = "#">Previous</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Next</a></li>
</ul>
 Aligned Links The following example demonstrates the use of classes for alignment, .previous, .next discussed in the above table ? 
<ul class = "pager">
   <li class = "previous"><a href = "#">&larr; Older</a></li>
   <li class = "next"><a href = "#">Newer &rarr;</a></li>
</ul>
 States The following example demonstrates the use of class .disabled discussed in the above table ? 
<ul class = "pager">
   <li class = "previous disabled"><a href = "#">&larr; Older</a></li>
   <li class = "next"><a href = "#">Newer &rarr;</a></li>
</ul>
 Bootstrap - Labels This chapter covers Bootstrap labels. Labels are great for offering counts, tips, or other markup for pages. Use class .label to display labels as shown in the following example ? 
<h1>Example Heading <span class = "label label-default">Label</span></h1>
<h2>Example Heading <span class =" label label-default">Label</span></h2>
<h3>Example Heading <span class = "label label-default">Label</span></h3>
<h4>Example Heading <span class = "label label-default">Label</span></h4>
 You can modify the appearance of the labels using the modifier classes such as, label-default, label-primary, label-success, label-info, label-warning, label-danger as shown in the following example ? 
<span class = "label label-default">Default Label</span>
<span class = "label label-primary">Primary Label</span>
<span class = "label label-success">Success Label</span>
<span class = "label label-info">Info Label</span>
<span class = "label label-warning">Warning Label</span>
<span class = "label label-danger">Danger Label</span>
 Bootstrap - Badges This chapter will discuss about Bootstrap badges. Badges are similar to labels; the primary difference is that the corners are more rounded. Badges are mainly used to highlight new or unread items. To use badges just add <span class = "badge"> to links, Bootstrap navs, and more. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<a href = "#">Mailbox <span class = "badge">50</span></a>
 When there are no new or unread items, badges will simply collapse via CSS's :empty selector, provided no content exists within. Active Nav States You can place badges in active states of pill and list navigations. You can achieve this by placing <span class = "badge"> to active links, as demonstrated in the following example ? 
<h4>Example for Active State in Pill </h4>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#">Home <span class ="badge">42</span></a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Profile</a></li>
   <li><a href = "#">Messages <span class = "badge">3</span></a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4>Example for Active State in navigations</h4>

<ul class = "nav nav-pills nav-stacked" style = "max-width: 260px;">
   <li class = "active">
      <a href = "#">
         <span class = "badge pull-right">42</span>
         Home
      </a>
   </li>
	
   <li><a href = "#">Profile</a></li>
	
   <li>
      <a href = "#">
         <span class = "badge pull-right">3</span>
         Messages
      </a>
   </li>
	
</ul>
 Bootstrap - Jumbotron This chapter will discuss one more feature that Bootstrap supports, the Jumbotron. As the name suggest this component can optionally increase the size of headings and add a lot of margin for landing page content. To use the Jumbotron ? Create a container <div> with the class of .jumbotron. In addition to a larger <h1>, the font-weight is reduced to 200px. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "container">

   <div class = "jumbotron">
      <h1>Welcome to landing page!</h1>
      <p>This is an example for jumbotron.</p>
      
      <p>
         <a class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg" role = "button">Learn more</a>
      </p>
   </div>
   
</div>
 To get a jumbotron of full width, and without rounded corners use the .jumbotron class outside all .container classes and instead add a .container within, as shown in the following example ? 
<div class = "jumbotron">
   
   <div class = "container">
      <h1>Welcome to landing page!</h1>
      <p>This is an example for jumbotron.</p>
      
      <p>
         <a class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg" role = "button">Learn more</a>
      </p>
   </div>
   
</div>
 Bootstrap - Page Header The page header is a nice little feature to add appropriate spacing around the headings on a page. This is particularly helpful on a web page where you may have several post titles and need a way to add distinction to each of them. To use a page header, wrap your heading in a <div> with a class of .page-header ? 
<div class = "page-header">
   
   <h1>
      Example page header 
      <small>Subtext for header</small>
   </h1>
   
</div>

<p>This is a sample text.This is a sample text.This is a sample text. This is a sample text.</p>
 Bootstrap - Thumbnails This chapter discusses about Bootstrap thumbnails. A lot of sites need a way to lay out images, videos, text, etc, in a grid, and Bootstrap has an easy way to do this with thumbnails. To create thumbnails using Bootstrap ? Add an <a> tag with the class of .thumbnail around an image. This adds four pixels of padding and a gray border. On hover, an animated glow outlines the image. The following example demonstrates a default thumbnail ? 
<div class = "row">
   
   <div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-3">
      <a href = "#" class = "thumbnail">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/kittens.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder thumbnail">
      </a>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-3">
      <a href = "#" class = "thumbnail">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/kittens.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder thumbnail">
      </a>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-3">
      <a href = "#" class = "thumbnail">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/kittens.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder thumbnail">
      </a>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-3">
      <a href = "#" class = "thumbnail">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/kittens.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder thumbnail">
      </a>
   </div>
   
</div>
 Adding Custom Content Now that we have a basic thumbnail, it's possible to add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails. Follow the steps below ? Change the <a> tag that has a class of .thumbnail to a <div>. Inside of that <div>, you can add anything you need. As this is a <div>, we can use the default span-based naming convention for sizing. If you want to group multiple images, place them in an unordered list, and each list item will be floated to the left. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "row">
   
   <div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-3">
      <div class = "thumbnail">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/kittens.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder thumbnail">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "caption">
         <h3>Thumbnail label</h3>
         <p>Some sample text. Some sample text.</p>
         
         <p>
            <a href = "#" class = "btn btn-primary" role = "button">
               Button
            </a> 
            
            <a href = "#" class = "btn btn-default" role = "button">
               Button
            </a>
         </p>
         
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "col-sm-6 col-md-3">
      <div class = "thumbnail">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/kittens.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder thumbnail">

 Bootstrap - Alerts This chapter will discuss about alerts and the classes Bootstrap provides for alerts. Alerts provide a way to style messages to the user. They provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions. You can add an optional close icon to alert. For inline dismissal use the Alerts jQuery plugin. You can add a basic alert by creating a wrapper <div> and adding a class of .alert and one of the four contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger). The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "alert alert-success">Success! Well done its submitted.</div>
<div class = "alert alert-info">Info! take this info.</div>
<div class = "alert alert-warning">Warning ! Dont submit this.</div>
<div class = "alert alert-danger">Error ! Change few things.</div>
 Dismissal Alerts To build a dismissal alert ? Add a basic alert by creating a wrapper <div> and adding a class of .alert and one of the four contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger) Also add optional .alert-dismissable to the above <div> class. Add a close button. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "alert alert-success alert-dismissable">
   <button type = "button" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert" aria-hidden = "true">
      &times;
   </button>
	
   Success! Well done its submitted.
</div>

<div class = "alert alert-info alert-dismissable">
   <button type = "button" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert" aria-hidden = "true">
      &times;
   </button>
	
   Info! take this info.
</div>

<div class = "alert alert-warning alert-dismissable">
   <button type = "button" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert" aria-hidden = "true">
      &times;
   </button>
	
   Warning ! Dont submit this.
</div>

<div class = "alert alert-danger alert-dismissable">
   <button type = "button" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert" aria-hidden = "true">
      &times;
   </button>
	
   Error ! Change few things.
</div>
 Be sure to use the <button> element with the data-dismiss = "alert" data attribute. Links in Alerts To get links in alerts ? Add a basic alert by creating a wrapper <div> and adding a class of .alert and one of the four contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger) Use the .alert-link utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert. 
<div class = "alert alert-success">
   <a href = "#" class = "alert-link">Success! Well done its submitted.</a>
</div>

<div class = "alert alert-info">
   <a href = "#" class = "alert-link">Info! take this info.</a>
</div>

<div class = "alert alert-warning">
   <a href = "#" class = "alert-link">Warning ! Dont submit this.</a>
</div>

<div class = "alert alert-danger">
   <a href = "#" class = "alert-link">Error ! Change few things.</a>

 Bootstrap - Progress Bars This chapter discusses about Bootstrap progress bars. The purpose of progress bars is to show that assets are loading, in progress, or that there is action taking place regarding elements on the page. Progress bars use CSS3 transitions and animations to achieve some of their effects. These features are not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and below or older versions of Firefox. Opera 12 does not support animations. Default Progress Bar To create a basic progress bar ? Add a <div> with a class of .progress. Next, inside the above <div>, add an empty <div> with a class of .progress-bar. Add a style attribute with the width expressed as a percentage. Say for example, style = "60%"; indicates that the progress bar was at 60%. Let us see an example below ? 
<div class = "progress">
   <div class = "progress-bar" role = "progressbar" aria-valuenow = "60" 
      aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 40%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">40% Complete</span>
   </div>
</div>
 Alternate Progress Bar To create a progress bar with different styles ? Add a <div> with a class of .progress. Next, inside the above <div>, add an empty <div> with a class of .progress-bar and class progress-bar-* where * could be success, info, warning, danger. Add a style attribute with the width expressed as a percentage. Say for example, style = "60%"; indicates that the progress bar was at 60%. Let us see an example below ? 
<div class = "progress">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-success" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 90%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">90% Complete (Sucess)</span>
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "progress">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-info" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 30%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">30% Complete (info)</span>
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "progress">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-warning" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 20%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">20%Complete (warning)</span>
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "progress">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-danger" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 10%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">10% Complete (danger)</span>
   </div>
</div>
 Striped Progress Bar To create a striped progress bar ? Add a <div> with a class of .progress and .progress-striped. Next, inside the above <div>, add an empty <div> with a class of .progress-bar and class progress-bar-* where * could be success, info, warning, danger. Add a style attribute with the width expressed as a percentage. Say for example, style = "60%"; indicates that the progress bar was at 60%. Let us see an example below ? 
<div class = "progress progress-striped">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-success" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 90%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">90% Complete (Sucess)</span>
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "progress progress-striped">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-info" role = "progressbar"
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 30%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">30% Complete (info)</span>
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "progress progress-striped">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-warning" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style="width: 20%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">20%Complete (warning)</span>
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "progress progress-striped">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-danger" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 10%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">10% Complete (danger)</span>
   </div>
</div>
 Animated Progress Bar To create an animated progress bar ? Add a <div> with a class of .progress and .progress-striped. Also add class .active to .progress-striped. Next, inside the above <div>, add an empty <div> with a class of .progress-bar. Add a style attribute with the width expressed as a percentage. Say for example, style = "60%"; indicates that the progress bar was at 60%. This will animate the stripes right to left. Let us see an example below ? 
<div class = "progress progress-striped active">
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-success" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 40%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">40% Complete</span>
   </div>
</div>
 Stacked Progress Bar You can even stack multiple progress bars. Place the multiple progress bars into the same .progress to stack them as seen in the following example ? 
<div class = "progress">
   
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-success" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 40%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">40% Complete</span>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-info" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 30%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">30% Complete (info)</span>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "progress-bar progress-bar-warning" role = "progressbar" 
      aria-valuenow = "60" aria-valuemin = "0" aria-valuemax = "100" style = "width: 20%;">
      
      <span class = "sr-only">20%Complete (warning)</span>
   </div>

 Bootstrap - Media Object This chapter discusses about Media object. These are abstract object styles for building various types of components (like blog comments, Tweets, etc.) that feature a left-aligned or right-aligned image alongside the textual content. The goal of the media object is to make the code for developing these blocks of information drastically shorter. The goal of media objects (light markup, easy extendability) is achieved by applying classes to some of the simple markup. There are two forms to the media object ? .media ? This class allows to float a media object (images, video, and audio) to the left or right of a content block. .media-list ? If you are preparing a list where the items will be part of an unordered list, use a class. useful for comment threads or articles lists. Let us see an example below of default media object ? 
<div class = "media">
   <a class = "pull-left" href = "#">
      <img class = "media-object" src = "/bootstrap/images/64.jpg" alt = "Media Object">
   </a>
   
   <div class = "media-body">
      <h4 class = "media-heading">Media heading</h4>

 Let us see an example of media list ? 
<ul class = "media-list">
   <li class = "media">
      <a class = "pull-left" href = "#">
         <img class = "media-object" src = "/bootstrap/images/64.jpg" alt = "Generic placeholder image">

</ul>
 Bootstrap - List Group The purpose of list group component is to render complex and customized content in lists. To get a basic list group ? Add the class .list-group to element <ul>. Add class .list-group-item to <li>. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<ul class = "list-group">
   <li class = "list-group-item">Free Domain Name Registration</li>
   <li class = "list-group-item">Free Window Space hosting</li>
   <li class = "list-group-item">Number of Images</li>
   <li class = "list-group-item">24*7 support</li>
   <li class = "list-group-item">Renewal cost per year</li>
</ul>
 Adding Badges to List Group We can add the badges component to any list group item and it will automatically be positioned on the right. Just add <span class = "badge"> within the <li> element. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<ul class = "list-group">
   <li class = "list-group-item">Free Domain Name Registration</li>
   <li class = "list-group-item">Free Window Space hosting</li>
   <li class = "list-group-item">Number of Images</li>
   
   <li class = "list-group-item">
      <span class = "badge">New</span>
      24*7 support
   </li>
   
   <li class = "list-group-item">Renewal cost per year</li>
   
   <li class = "list-group-item">
      <span class = "badge">New</span>
      Disocunt Offer
   </li>
	
</ul>
 Linking List Group Items By using the anchor tags instead of list items, we can link the list groups. We need to use <div> instead of <ul> element. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item active">
   Free Domain Name Registration
</a>

<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">24*7 support</a>
<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">Free Window Space hosting</a>
<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">Number of Images</a>
<a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">Renewal cost per year</a>
 Add Custom Content to List Group We can add any HTML content to the above linked list groups. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "list-group">
   <a href = "#" class = "list-group-item active">
      <h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">
         Starter Website Package
      </h4>
   </a>
   
   <a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">
      <h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">
         Free Domain Name Registration
      </h4>
      
      <p class = "list-group-item-text">
         You will get a free domain registration with website pages.
      </p>
   </a>
   
   <a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">
      <h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">
         24*7 support
      </h4>
      
      <p class = "list-group-item-text">
         We provide 24*7 support.
      </p>
   </a>
   
</div>

<div class = "list-group">
   <a href = "#" class = "list-group-item active">
      <h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">
         Business Website Package
      </h4>
   </a>
   
   <a href = "#" class="list-group-item">
      <h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">
         Free Domain Name Registration
      </h4>
      
      <p class = "list-group-item-text">
         You will get a free domain registration with website pages.
      </p>
   </a>
   
   <a href = "#" class = "list-group-item">
      <h4 class = "list-group-item-heading">24*7 support</h4>
      <p class = "list-group-item-text">We provide 24*7 support.</p>
   </a>
   
</div>
 Bootstrap - Panels This chapter will discuss about Bootstrap panels. Panel components are used when you want to put your DOM component in a box. To get a basic panel, just add class .panel to the <div> element. Also add class .panel-default to this element as shown in the following example ? 
<div class = "panel panel-default">
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
</div>
 Panel with Heading There are two ways to add panel heading ? Use .panel-heading class to easily add a heading container to your panel. Use any <h1>-<h6> with a .panel-title class to add a pre-styled heading. The following example demonstrates both the ways ? 
<div class = "panel panel-default">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      Panel heading without title
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      Panel content
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "panel panel-default">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">
         Panel With title
      </h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      Panel content
   </div>
</div>
 Panel with Footer You can add footers to panels, by wrapping buttons or secondary text in a <div> containing class .panel-footer. The following example demonstrates this. 
<div class = "panel panel-default">
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-footer">Panel footer</div>
</div>
 Panel footers do not inherit colors and borders when using contextual variations as they are not meant to be in the foreground. Panel Contextual Alternatives Use contextual state classes such as, panel-primary, panel-success, panel-info, panel-warning, panel-danger, to make a panel more meaningful to a particular context. 
<div class = "panel panel-primary">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">Panel title</h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "panel panel-success">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">Panel title</h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "panel panel-info">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">Panel title</h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "panel panel-warning">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">Panel title</h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
</div>

<div class = "panel panel-danger">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">Panel title</h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
</div>
 Panel with Tables To get a non-bordered table within a panel, use the class .table within the panel. Suppose there is a <div> containing .panel-body, we add an extra border to the top of the table for separation. If there is no <div> containing .panel-body, then the component moves from panel header to table without interruption. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div class = "panel panel-default">
   <div class = "panel-heading">
      <h3 class = "panel-title">Panel title</h3>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      This is a Basic panel
   </div>
   
   <table class = "table">
      <tr>
         <th>Product</th>
         <th>Price </th>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Product A</td>
         <td>200</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
         <td>Product B</td>
         <td>400</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
</div>

<div class = "panel panel-default">

 Panel with List groups You can include list groups within any panel. Create a panel by adding class .panel to the <div> element. Also add class .panel-default to this element. Now within this panel include your list groups. You can learn to create a list group from chapter List Groups. 
<div class = "panel panel-default">
   <div class ="panel-heading">Panel heading</div>
   
   <div class = "panel-body">
      <p>This is a Basic panel content. This is a Basic panel content.
         This is a Basic panel content. This is a Basic panel content.
         This is a Basic panel content. This is a Basic panel content.
         This is a Basic panel content.</p>
   </div>
   
   <ul class = "list-group">

 Bootstrap - Wells A well is a container in <div> that causes the content to appear sunken or an inset effect on the page. To create a well, simply wrap the content that you would like to appear in the well with a <div> containing the class of .well. The following example shows a default well ? 
<div class = "well">Hi, am in well !!</div>
 Sizing You can change the size of well using the optional classes such as, well-lg or well-lg. These classes are used in conjunction with .well class. These affect the padding, making the well larger or smaller depending on the class. 
<div class = "well well-lg">Hi, am in large well !!</div>
<div class = "well well-sm">Hi, am in small well !!</div>
 Bootstrap - Plugins Overview The components discussed in the previous chapters under Layout Components are just the beginning. Bootstrap comes bundled with 12 jQuery plugins that extend the features and can add more interaction to your site. To get started with the Bootstrap’s JavaScript plugins, you don’t need to be an advanced JavaScript developer. By utilizing Bootstrap Data API, most of the plugins can be triggered without writing a single line of code. Bootstrap Plugins can be included on your site in two forms ? Individually ? Using Bootstrap's individual *.js files. Some plugins and CSS components depend on other plugins. If you include plugins individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in the docs. Or compiled (all at once) ? Using bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Do not attempt to include both, as both bootstrap.js and bootstrap.min.js contain all plugins in a single file. All plugins depend on jQuery. So jQuery must be included before the plugin files. Check bower.json to see which versions of jQuery are supported. Data Attributes All of the Bootstrap plugins are accessible using the included Data API. Hence, you don’t need to include a single line of JavaScript to invoke any of the plugin features. In some situations it may be desirable to turn this functionality of Data API off. If you need to turn off the Data API, you can unbind the attributes by adding the following line of JavaScript ? 
$(document).off('.data-api')
 To turn off a specific/single plugin, just include the plugin's name as a namespace along with the data-api namespace like this ? 
$(document).off('.alert.data-api')
 Programmatic API The developers of Bootstrap believe that you should be able to use all of the plugins purely through the JavaScript API. All public APIs are single, chainable methods, and return the collection acted upon say for example ? 
$(".btn.danger").button("toggle").addClass("fat")
 All methods accept an optional options object, a string which targets a particular method, or nothing (which initiates a plugin with default behavior) as shown below ? 
// initialized with defaults
$("#myModal").modal()    

 // initialized with no keyboard                  
$("#myModal").modal({ keyboard: false })  

// initializes and invokes show immediately
$("#myModal").modal('show')                
 Each plugin also exposes its raw constructor on a Constructor property: $.fn.popover.Constructor. If you'd like to get a particular plugin instance, retrieve it directly from an element ? 
$('[rel = popover]').data('popover').
 No Conflict Bootstrap plugins can sometimes be used with other UI frameworks. In these circumstances, namespace collisions can occasionally occur. To overcome this call .noConflict on the plugin you wish to revert the value of. 
// return $.fn.button to previously assigned value
var bootstrapButton = $.fn.button.noConflict()

// give $().bootstrapBtn the Bootstrap functionality
$.fn.bootstrapBtn = bootstrapButton            
 Events Bootstrap provides custom events for most plugin's unique actions. Generally, these events come in two forms ? Infinitive form ? This is triggered at the start of an event. E.g. show. Infinitive events provide preventDefault functionality. This provides the ability to stop the execution of an action before it starts. 
$('#myModal').on('show.bs.modal', function (e) {
   // stops modal from being shown
   if (!data) return e.preventDefault() 
})
 Past participle form ? This is triggered on the completion of an action. E.g. shown. Bootstrap - Transition Plugin The transition plugin provides a simple transition effects. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need transition.js once alongside the other JS files. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Transition.js is a basic helper for transitionEnd events as well as a CSS transition emulator. It is used by the other plugins to check for CSS transition support and to catch hanging transitions. Use Cases A few examples of the transition plugin are ? Sliding or fading in modals. You can find an example in the chapter Bootstrap Modal Plugin. Fading out tabs. You can find an example in the chapter Bootstrap Tab Plugin. Fading out alerts. You can find an example in the chapter Bootstrap Alerts. Sliding carousel panes. You can find an example in the chapter Bootstrap Carousel Plugin. Bootstrap - Modal Plugin A modal is a child window that is layered over its parent window. Typically, the purpose is to display content from a separate source that can have some interaction without leaving the parent window. Child windows can provide information, interaction, or more. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need modal.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage You can toggle the modal plugin's hidden content ? Via data attributes ? Set attribute data-toggle = "modal" on a controller element, like a button or link, along with a data-target = "#identifier" or href = "#identifier" to target a specific modal (with the id = "identifier") to toggle. Via JavaScript ? Using this technique you can call a modal with id = "identifier" with a single line of JavaScript ? 
$('#identifier').modal(options)
 Example A static modal window example is shown in the following example ? 
<h2>Example of creating Modals with Twitter Bootstrap</h2>

<!-- Button trigger modal -->
<button class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-toggle = "modal" data-target = "#myModal">
   Launch demo modal
</button>

<!-- Modal -->
<div class = "modal fade" id = "myModal" tabindex = "-1" role = "dialog" 
   aria-labelledby = "myModalLabel" aria-hidden = "true">
   
   <div class = "modal-dialog">

            </button>
            
            <h4 class = "modal-title" id = "myModalLabel">
               This Modal title
            </h4>
         </div>
         
         <div class = "modal-body">
            Add some text here
         </div>
         
         <div class = "modal-footer">
            <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" data-dismiss = "modal">
               Close
            </button>
            
            <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary">
               Submit changes
            </button>
         </div>
         
      </div><!-- /.modal-content -->
   </div><!-- /.modal-dialog -->
  
</div><!-- /.modal -->
 Details of the preceding code ? To invoke the modal window, you need to have some kind of a trigger. You can use a button or a link. Here we have used a button. If you look in the code above, you will see that in the <button> tag, the data-target = "#myModal" is the target of the modal that you want to load on the page. This code allows you to create multiple modals on the page and then have different triggers for each of them. Now, to be clear, you don’t load multiple modals at the same time, but you can create many on the pages to be loaded at different times. There are two classes to take note of in the modal ? The first is .modal, which is simply identifying the content of the <div> as a modal. And second is the .fade class. When the modal is toggled, it will cause the content to fade in and out. aria-labelledby = "myModalLabel", attribute reference the modal title. The attribute aria-hidden = "true" is used to keep the Modal Window invisible till a trigger comes (like a click on the associated button). <div class = "modal-header">, modal-header is the class to define style for the header of the modal window. class = "close", is a CSS class close that sets style for the Close button of the modal window. data-dismiss = "modal", is a custom HTML5 data attribute. Here it is used to close the modal window. class = "modal-body", is a CSS class of Bootstrap CSS to set style for body of the modal window. class = "modal-footer", is a CSS class of Bootstrap CSS to set style for footer of the modal window. data-toggle = "modal", HTML5 custom data attribute data-toggle is used to open the modal window. Options There are certain options which can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript to customize the look and feel of the Modal Window. Following table lists the options ? Option Name Type/Default Value Data attribute name Description backdrop boolean or the string 'static' Default: true data-backdrop Specify static for a backdrop, if you don’t want the modal to be closed when the user clicks outside of the modal. keyboard boolean Default: true data-keyboard Closes the modal when escape key is pressed; set to false to disable. show boolean Default: true data-show Shows the modal when initialized. remote path Default: false data-remote Using the jQuery .load method, inject content into the modal body. If an href with a valid URL is added, it will load that content. An example of this is shown below ? 
<a data-toggle = "modal" href = "remote.html" data-target = "#modal">Click me</a>
 Methods Here are some useful methods that can be used with modal(). Method Description Example Options ? .modal(options) Activates your content as a modal. Accepts an optional options object. 
$('#identifier').modal({
   keyboard: false
})
 Toggle ? .modal('toggle') Manually toggles a modal. 
$('#identifier').modal('toggle')
 Show ? .modal('show') Manually opens a modal. 
$('#identifier').modal('show')
 Hide ? .modal('hide') Manually hides a modal. 
$('#identifier').modal('hide')
 Example The following example demonstrates the usage of methods ?

</div><!-- /.modal -->

<script>
   $(function () { $('#myModal').modal({
      keyboard: true
   })});
</script>
 Just click the Esc button and the modal window exits. Events Following table lists the events to work with modal. These events may be used to hook into the function. Event Description Example show.bs.modal Fired after the show method is called. 
$('#identifier').on('show.bs.modal', function () {
   // do something…
})
 shown.bs.modal Fired when the modal has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). 
$('#identifier').on('shown.bs.modal', function () {
   // do something…
})
 hide.bs.modal Fired when the hide instance method has been called. 
$('#identifier').on('hide.bs.modal', function () {
   // do something…
})
 hidden.bs.modal Fired when the modal has finished being hidden from the user. 
$('#identifier').on('hidden.bs.modal', function () {
   // do something…
})

 As seen in the above screen, if you click on the Close button i.e hide event, an alert message is displayed. Bootstrap - Dropdown Plugin Using Dropdown plugin you can add dropdown menus to any components like navbars, tabs, pills and buttons. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need dropdown.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage You can toggle the dropdown plugin's hidden content ? Via data attributes ? Add data-toggle = "dropdown" to a link or button to toggle a dropdown as shown below ? 
<div class = "dropdown">
   <a data-toggle = "dropdown" href = "#">Dropdown trigger</a>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu" aria-labelledby = "dLabel">
      ...
   </ul>
	
</div>
 If you need to keep links intact (which is useful if the browser is not enabling JavaScript), use the data-target attribute instead of href = "#"? 
<div class = "dropdown">
   <a id = "dLabel" role = "button" data-toggle = "dropdown" data-target = "#" href = "/page.html">
      Dropdown 
      <span class = "caret"></span>
   </a>
   
   <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu" aria-labelledby = "dLabel">
      ...
   </ul>
	
</div>
 Via JavaScript ? To call the dropdown toggle via JavaScript, use the following method ? 
$('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown()
 Example Within Navbar The following example demonstrates the usage of dropdown menu within a navbar ? 
<nav class = "navbar navbar-default" role = "navigation">

   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">TutorialsPoint</a>
   </div>
   
   <div>
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li class = "active"><a href = "#">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#">SVN</a></li>
         
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java 
               <b class="caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href = "#">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">EJB</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#">Jasper Report</a></li>

 Bootstrap - Scroll spy Plugin The Scroll spy (auto updating nav) plugin allows you to target sections of the page based on the scroll position. In its basic implementation, as you scroll, you can add .active classes to the navbar based on the scroll position. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need scrollspy.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage You can add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation ? Via data attributes ? add data-spy = "scroll" to the element you want to spy on (typically the body). Then add attribute data-target with the ID or class of the parent element of any Bootstrap .nav component. For this to work, you must have elements in the body of the page that have matching IDs of the links that you are spying on. 
<body data-spy = "scroll" data-target = ".navbar-example">
   ...
   <div class = "navbar-example">
      <ul class = "nav nav-tabs">
         ...
      </ul>
   </div>
   ...
</body>
 Via JavaScript ? You can invoke the scrollspy with JavaScript instead of using the data attributes, by selecting the element to spy on, and then invoking the .scrollspy() function ? 
$('body').scrollspy({ target: '.navbar-example' })
 Example The following example shows the use of scrollspy plugin via data attributes ? 
<nav id = "navbar-example" class = "navbar navbar-default navbar-static" role = "navigation">
   
   <div class = "navbar-header">
      <button class = "navbar-toggle" type = "button" data-toggle = "collapse" 
         data-target = ".bs-js-navbar-scrollspy">
         <span class = "sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
         <span class = "icon-bar"></span>
         <span class = "icon-bar"></span>
         <span class = "icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
		
      <a class = "navbar-brand" href = "#">Tutorial Name</a>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "collapse navbar-collapse bs-js-navbar-scrollspy">
      <ul class = "nav navbar-nav">
         <li><a href = "#ios">iOS</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#svn">SVN</a></li>
         
         <li class = "dropdown">
            <a href = "#" id = "navbarDrop1" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
               Java
               <b class = "caret"></b>
            </a>
            
            <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu" aria-labelledby = "navbarDrop1">
               <li><a href = "#jmeter" tabindex = "-1">jmeter</a></li>
               <li><a href = "#ejb" tabindex = "-1">ejb</a></li>
               
               <li class = "divider"></li>
               <li><a href = "#spring" tabindex = "-1">spring</a></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>

 Options Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. Following table lists the options ? Option Name Type/Default Value Data attribute name Description offset number Default: 10 data-offset Pixels to offset from top when calculating position of scroll. Methods .scrollspy('refresh') ? When calling the scrollspy via the JavaScript method, you need to call the .refresh method to update the DOM. This is helpful if any elements of the DOM have changed i.e if you have added or removed some elements. Following would be the syntax to use this method. 
$('[data-spy = "scroll"]').each(function () {
   var $spy = $(this).scrollspy('refresh')
})
 Example The following example demonstrates the use of .scrollspy('refresh') method ?

 Bootstrap - Tab Plugin Tabs were introduced in the chapter Bootstrap Navigation Elements. By combining a few data attributes, you can easily create a tabbed interface. With this plug-in you can transition through panes of local content in tabs or pills, even via drop down menus. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need tab.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage You can enable tabs in the following two ways ? Via data attributes ? you need to add data-toggle = "tab" or data-toggle = "pill" to the anchors. Adding the nav and nav-tabs classes to the tab ul will apply the Bootstrap tab styling, while adding the nav and nav-pills classes will apply pill styling. 
<ul class = "nav nav-tabs">
   <li><a href = "#identifier" data-toggle = "tab">Home</a></li>
   ...
</ul>
 Via JavaScript ? you can enable tabs using Javscript as below ? 
$('#myTab a').click(function (e) {
   e.preventDefault()
   $(this).tab('show')
})
 Here’s an example of different ways to activate individual tabs ? 
// Select tab by name
$('#myTab a[href = "#profile"]').tab('show')
 
// Select first tab
$('#myTab a:first').tab('show') 

// Select last tab
$('#myTab a:last').tab('show') 

// Select third tab (0-indexed)
$('#myTab li:eq(2) a').tab('show') 
 Fade Effect To get a fade effect for tabs, add .fade to each .tab-pane. The first tab pane must also have .in to properly fade in initial content ? 
<div class = "tab-content">
   <div class = "tab-pane fade in active" id = "home">...</div>
   <div class = "tab-pane fade" id = "svn">...</div>
   <div class = "tab-pane fade" id = "ios">...</div>
   <div class = "tab-pane fade" id = "java">...</div>
</div>
 Example An example of tab plugin using data attributes and fade effect is as shown in the following example ? 
<ul id = "myTab" class = "nav nav-tabs">
   <li class = "active">
      <a href = "#home" data-toggle = "tab">
         Tutorial Point Home
      </a>
   </li>
   
   <li><a href = "#ios" data-toggle = "tab">iOS</a></li>
	
   <li class = "dropdown">
      <a href = "#" id = "myTabDrop1" class = "dropdown-toggle" data-toggle = "dropdown">
         Java 
         <b class = "caret"></b>
      </a>
      
      <ul class = "dropdown-menu" role = "menu" aria-labelledby = "myTabDrop1">
         <li><a href = "#jmeter" tabindex = "-1" data-toggle = "tab">jmeter</a></li>
         <li><a href = "#ejb" tabindex = "-1" data-toggle = "tab">ejb</a></li>
      </ul>
      
   </li>
	
</ul>

 Methods .$().tab ? This method activates a tab element and content container. Tab should have either a data-target or an href targeting a container node in the DOM. 
<ul class = "nav nav-tabs" id = "myTab">
   <li class = "active"><a href = "#identifier" data-toggle = "tab">Home</a></li>
   .....
</ul>

<div class = "tab-content">
   <div class = "tab-pane active" id = "home">...</div>
   .....
</div>

<script>
   $(function () {
      $('#myTab a:last').tab('show')
   })
</script>
 Example The following example shows the use of tab plugin method .tab. Here in the example the second tab iOS is activated ?

 Bootstrap - Tool tip Plug-in Tooltips are useful when you need to describe a link. The plugin was inspired by jQuery.tipsy plugin written by Jason Frame. Tooltips have since been updated to work without images, animate with a CSS animation, and data-attributes for local title storage. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need tooltip.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage The tooltip plugin generates content and markup on demand, and by default places tooltips after their trigger element. You can add tooltips in the following two ways ? Via data attributes ? To add a tooltip, add data-toggle = "tooltip" to an anchor tag. The title of the anchor will be the text of a tooltip. By default, tooltip is set to top by the plugin. 
<a href = "#" data-toggle = "tooltip" title = "Example tooltip">Hover over me</a>
 Via JavaScript ? Trigger the tooltip via JavaScript ? 
$('#identifier').tooltip(options)
 Tooltip plugin is NOT only-css plugins like dropdown or other plugins discussed in previous chapters. To use this plugin you MUST activate it using jquery (read javascript). To enable all the tooltips on your page just use this script ? 
$(function () { $("[data-toggle = 'tooltip']").tooltip(); });
 Example The following example demonstrates the use of tooltip plugin via data attributes. 
<h4>Tooltip examples for anchors</h4>

This is a <a href = "#" class = "tooltip-test" data-toggle = "tooltip" 
   title = "Tooltip on left"> Default Tooltip</a>.

This is a <a href = "#" class = "tooltip-test" data-toggle = "tooltip" 
   data-placement = "left" title = "Tooltip on left">Tooltip on Left</a>.

This is a <a href = "#" data-toggle = "tooltip" data-placement = "top" 
   title = "Tooltip on top">Tooltip on Top</a>.

This is a <a href = "#" data-toggle = "tooltip" data-placement = "bottom"
   title = "Tooltip on bottom">Tooltip on Bottom</a>.

This is a <a href = "#" data-toggle = "tooltip" data-placement = "right" 
   title = "Tooltip on right">Tooltip on Right</a>
	
<br>

<h4>Tooltip examples for buttons</h4>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" data-toggle = "tooltip" title = "Tooltip on left">
   Default Tooltip
</button>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" data-toggle = "tooltip" 
   data-placement = "left" title = "Tooltip on left">
	
   Tooltip on left
</button>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" data-toggle = "tooltip" 
   data-placement = "top" title = "Tooltip on top">
   
   Tooltip on top
</button>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-default" data-toggle = "tooltip" 
   data-placement = "bottom" title = "Tooltip on bottom">
   
   Tooltip on bottom
</button>

<button type = " button" class = " btn btn-default" data-toggle = "tooltip" 
   data-placement = "right" title = "Tooltip on right">
   
   Tooltip on right
</button>

<script>
   $(function () { $("[data-toggle = 'tooltip']").tooltip(); });
</script>

Option Name Type/Default Value Data attribute name Description animation boolean Default: true data-animation Applies a CSS fade transition to the tooltip. html boolean Default: false data-html Inserts HTML into the tooltip. If false, jQuery’s text method will be used to insert content into the dom. Use text if you’re worried about XSS attacks. placement string|function Default: top data-placement Specifies how to position the tooltip (i.e., top|bottom|left|right|auto). When auto is specified, it will dynamically reorient the tooltip. For example, if placement is "auto left", the tooltip will display to the left when possible, otherwise it will display right. selector string Default: false data-selector If a selector is provided, tooltip objects will be delegated to the specified targets. title string | function Default: " data-title The title option is the default title value if the title attribute isn’t present. trigger string Default: 'hover focus' data-trigger Defines how the tooltip is triggered: click| hover | focus | manual. You may pass multiple triggers; separate them with a space. content string | function Default: '' data-content Default content value if data-content attribute isn't present delay number | object Default: 0 data-delay Delays showing and hiding the tooltip in ms — does not apply to manual trigger type. If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show. Object structure is ? 
delay: { show: 500, hide: 100 }
 container string | false Default: false data-container Appends the tooltip to a specific element. Example: container: 'body' Methods The following are some useful methods for tooltips ? Method Description Example Options ? .tooltip(options) Attaches a tooltip handler to an element collection.

 Bootstrap - Popover Plugin The popover is similar to tooltip, offering an extended view complete with a heading. For the popover to activate, a user just needs to hover the cursor over the element. The content of the popover can be populated entirely using the Bootstrap Data API. This method requires a tooltip. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need the popover.js and it has a dependency of the tooltip plugin. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage The popover plugin generates content and markup on demand, and by default places popover after their trigger element. You can add popover in the following two ways ? Via data attributes ? To add a popover, add data-toggle = "popover" to an anchor/button tag. The title of the anchor will be the text of a popover. By default, popover is set to top by the plugin. 
<a href = "#" data-toggle = "popover" title = "Example popover">
   Hover over me
</a>
 Via JavaScript ? Enable popovers via JavaScript using the following syntax ? 
$('#identifier').popover(options)
 Popover plugin is NOT only-css plugins like dropdown or other plugins discussed in previous chapters. To use this plugin you MUST activate it using jquery (read javascript). To enable all the popovers on your page just use this script ? 
$(function () { $("[data-toggle = 'popover']").popover(); });

 Bootstrap - Alert Plugin Alert messages are mostly used to display information such as warning or confirmation messages to the end users. Using alert message plugin you can add dismiss functionality to all alert messages. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need the alert.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include the bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage You can enable dismissal of an alert in the following two ways ? Via data attributes ? To dismiss via Data API just add data-dismiss = "alert" to your close button to automatically give an alert close functionality. 
<a class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert" href = "#" aria-hidden = "true">
   &times;
</a>
 Via JavaScript ? To dismiss via JavaScript use the following syntax ? 
$(".alert").alert()
 Example The following example demonstrates the use of alert plugin via data attributes. 
<div class = "alert alert-success">
   <a href = "#" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert">
      &times;
   </a>
   
   <strong>Warning!</strong> There was a problem with your network connection.
</div>
 Options There are no options here. Methods The following are some useful methods for alert plugin ? Method Description Example .alert() This method wraps all alerts with close functionality. 
$('#identifier').alert();
 Close Method .alert('close') To enable all alerts to be closed, add this method. 
$('#identifier').alert('close');
 To enable alerts to animate out when closed, make sure they have the .fade and .in class already applied to them. Example The following example demonstrates the use of .alert() method ? 
<h3>Alert messages to demonstrate alert() method </h3>

<div id = "myAlert" class = "alert alert-success">
   <a href = "#" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert">&times;</a>
   <strong>Success!</strong> the result is successful.
</div>

<div id = "myAlert" class = "alert alert-warning">
   <a href = "#" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert">&times;</a>
   <strong>Warning!</strong> There was a problem with your network connection.
</div>

<script type = "text/javascript">
   $(function(){
      $(".close").click(function(){
         $("#myAlert").alert();
      });
   });  
</script> 
 The following example demonstrates the use of .alert('close') method ? 
<h3>Alert messages to demonstrate alert('close') method </h3>

<div id = "myAlert" class = "alert alert-success">
   <a href = "#" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert">&times;</a>
   <strong>Success!</strong> the result is successful.
</div>

<div id = "myAlert" class = "alert alert-warning">
   <a href = "#" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert">&times;</a>
   <strong>Warning!</strong> There was a problem with your network connection.
</div>

<script type = "text/javascript">
   $(function(){
      $(".close").click(function(){
         $("#myAlert").alert('close');
      });
   });  
</script>   
 Try this code using the Try it editor. You can see that the close functionality is applied to all the alert messages i.e. close any alert message, rest of the alert messages also gets closed. Events Following table lists the events to work with alert plugin. This event may be used to hook into the alert function. Event Description Example close.bs.alert This event fires immediately when the close instance method is called. 
$('#myalert').bind('close.bs.alert', function () {
   // do something
})
 closed.bs.alert This event is fired when the alert has been closed (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). 
$('#myalert').bind('closed.bs.alert', function () {
   // do something
})
 Example The following example demonstrates the alert plugin events ? 
<div id = "myAlert" class = "alert alert-success">
   <a href = "#" class = "close" data-dismiss = "alert">&times;</a>
   <strong>Success!</strong> the result is successful.
</div>

<script type = "text/javascript">
   $(function(){
      $("#myAlert").bind('closed.bs.alert', function () {
         alert("Alert message box is closed.");
      });
   });
</script>  
 Bootstrap - Button Plugin Buttons were explained in chapter Bootstrap Buttons. With this plugin you can add in some interaction such as control button states or create groups of buttons for more components like toolbars. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need the button.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include the bootstrap.js or the minified the bootstrap.min.js. Loading State To add a loading state to a button, simply add the data-loading-text = "Loading..." as an attribute to the button element as shown in the following example ? 
<button id = "fat-btn" class = "btn btn-primary" data-loading-text = "Loading..." type = "button"> 
   Loading state 
</button>

<script>
   $(function() { 
      $(".btn").click(function(){
         $(this).button('loading').delay(1000).queue(function() {
            // $(this).button('reset');
         });        
      });
   });  
</script>
 When you click on the button the output would be as seen in the following image ? Single toggle To activate toggling (i.e. change the normal state of a button to a push state and vice versa) on a single button, add the data-toggle = "button" as an attribute to the button element as shown in the following example ? 
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary" data-toggle = "button">
   Single toggle
</button>
 Checkbox You can create group of checkboxes and add toggling to it by simply adding the data attribute data-toggle = "buttons" to the btn-group. 
<div class = "btn-group" data-toggle = "buttons">
   <label class = "btn btn-primary">
      <input type = "checkbox"> Option 1
   </label>
   
   <label class = "btn btn-primary">
      <input type = "checkbox"> Option 2
   </label>
   
   <label class = "btn btn-primary">
      <input type = "checkbox"> Option 3
   </label>
</div>
 Radio Similarly you can create a group of radio inputs and add toggling to it by simply adding the data attribute data-toggle = "buttons" to the btn-group. 
<div class = "btn-group" data-toggle = "buttons">
   <label class = "btn btn-primary">
      <input type = "radio" name =" options" id = "option1"> Option 1
   </label>
   
   <label class = "btn btn-primary">
      <input type = "radio" name = "options" id = "option2"> Option 2
   </label>
   
   <label class = "btn btn-primary">
      <input type = "radio" name = "options" id = "option3"> Option 3
   </label>
</div>	
 Usage You can enable buttons plugin via JavaScript as shown below ? 
$('.btn').button()
 Options There are no options. Methods Given below are some of the useful methods for buttons plugin ? Method Description Example button('toggle') Toggles push state. Gives the button the appearance that it has been activated. You can also enable auto toggling of a button by using the data-toggle attribute. 
$().button('toggle')
 .button('loading') When loading, the button is disabled and the text is changed to the option from the data-loading-text attribute of button element 
$().button('loading')
 .button('reset') Resets button state, bringing the original content back to the text. This method is useful when you need to return the button back to the primary state 
$().button('reset')
 .button(string) String in this method is referring to any string declared by the user. To reset the button state and bring in new content use this method. 
$().button(string)
 Example The following example demonstrates the use of the above methods ? 
<h2>Click on each of the buttons to see the effects of methods</h2>
<h4>Example to demonstrate .button('toggle') method</h4>

<div id = "myButtons1" class = "bs-example">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
</div>

<h4>Example to demonstrate  .button('loading') method</h4>

<div id = "myButtons2" class = "bs-example">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary" data-loading-text = "Loading...">
      Primary
   </button>
</div>

<h4>Example to demonstrate .button('reset') method</h4>

<div id = "myButtons3" class = "bs-example">
   <button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary" data-loading-text = "Loading...">
      Primary
   </button>
</div>

<h4>Example to demonstrate  .button(string) method</h4>

<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary" id = "myButton4" 
   data-complete-text = "Loading finished">
   Click Me
</button>

<script type = "text/javascript">
   $(function () {
      $("#myButtons1 .btn").click(function(){
         $(this).button('toggle');
      });
   });
   
   $(function() { 
      $("#myButtons2 .btn").click(function(){
         $(this).button('loading').delay(1000).queue(function() {
         });        
      });
   });   
   
   $(function() { 
      $("#myButtons3 .btn").click(function(){
         $(this).button('loading').delay(1000).queue(function() {
            $(this).button('reset');
         });        
      });
   });  
   
   $(function() { 
      $("#myButton4").click(function(){
         $(this).button('loading').delay(1000).queue(function() {
            $(this).button('complete');
         });        
      });
   });

 Bootstrap - Collapse Plugin The collapse plugin makes it easy to make collapsing divisions of the page. Whether you use it to build an accordion navigation or content boxes, it allows for a lot of content options. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need the collapse.js. This also requires the Transition Plugin to be included in your version of Bootstrap. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include the bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. You can use the collapse plugin ? To create collapsible groups or accordion. This can be created as in the sample example below ? 
<div class = "panel-group" id = "accordion">
   <div class = "panel panel-default">
      
      <div class = "panel-heading">
         <h4 class = "panel-title">
            <a data-toggle = "collapse" data-parent = "#accordion" href = "#collapseOne">
               Click me to expand. Click me again to collapse.Section 1
            </a>
         </h4>
      </div>
      
      <div id = "collapseOne" class = "panel-collapse collapse in">
         <div class = "panel-body">
            Nihil anim keffiyeh helvetica, craft beer labore wes anderson cred 
               nesciunt sapiente ea proident. Ad vegan excepteur butcher vice lomo.
         </div>
      </div>
      
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel panel-default">
      <div class = "panel-heading">
         <h4 class = "panel-title">
            <a data-toggle = "collapse" data-parent = "#accordion" href = "#collapseTwo">
               Click me to expand. Click me again to collapse.Section 2
            </a>
         </h4>
      </div>

      <div id = "collapseTwo" class = "panel-collapse collapse">
         <div class = "panel-body">
            Nihil anim keffiyeh helvetica, craft beer labore wes anderson cred nesciunt 
               sapiente ea proident. Ad vegan excepteur butcher vice lomo.
         </div>
      </div>
      
   </div>
   
   <div class = "panel panel-default">
      <div class = "panel-heading">
         <h4 class = "panel-title">
            <a data-toggle = "collapse" data-parent = "#accordion" href = "#collapseThree">
               Click me to expand. Click me again to collapse.Section 3
            </a>
         </h4>
      </div>
     
      <div id = "collapseThree" class = "panel-collapse collapse">
         <div class = "panel-body">
            Nihil anim keffiyeh helvetica, craft beer labore wes anderson cred nesciunt 
               sapiente ea proident. Ad vegan excepteur butcher vice lomo.
         </div>
      </div>
     
   </div>
</div>
 data-toggle = "collapse" is added to the link on which you click to expand or collapse the component. href or a data-target attribute is added to the parent component, whose value is id of the child component. data-parent attribute is added for creating the accordion like effect. To create simple collapsible without the accordion markup ? This can be created as in the sample example below ? 
<button type = "button" class = "btn btn-primary" data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#demo">
   simple collapsible
</button>

<div id = "demo" class = "collapse in">
   Nihil anim keffiyeh helvetica, craft beer labore wes anderson cred nesciunt
      sapiente ea proident. Ad vegan excepteur butcher vice lomo.
</div>
 As you can see in the example we have created a simple collapsible component, unlike accordion, we haven't added the attribute data-parent. Usage Following table lists the classes that the collapse plugin utilizes to handle the heavy lifting ? Class Description .collapse Hides the content. .collapse.in Shows the content. .collapsing Is added when the transition starts, and removed when it finishes. You can use collapse plugin in two ways ? Via data attributes ? Add data-toggle = "collapse" and a data-target to the element to automatically assign control of a collapsible element. The data-target attribute will accept a CSS selector to apply the collapse to. Be sure to add the class .collapse to the collapsible element. If you’d like it to default open, include the additional class .in. To add accordion-like group management to a collapsible control, add the data attribute data-parent = "#selector". Via JavaScript ? The collapse method can be activated with JavaScript as shown below ? 
$('.collapse').collapse()
 Options There are certain options which can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript are listed in the following table ? Option Name Type/Default Value Data attribute name Description parent selector Default ? false data-parent If selector is false, then all collapsible elements under the specified parent will be closed (similar to traditional accordion behavior - this dependent on the accordion-group class). toggle boolean Default ? true data-toggle Toggles the collapsible element on invocation. Methods Here is a list of some useful methods that are used with collapsible elements. Method Description Example Options ? .collapse(options) Activates your content as a collapsible element. Accepts an optional options object. 
$('#identifier').collapse({
   toggle: false
})
 Toggle ? .collapse('toggle') Toggles a collapsible element to shown or hidden. 
$('#identifier').collapse('toggle')
 Show ? .collapse('show') Shows a collapsible element. 
$('#identifier').collapse('show')
 Hide ? .collapse('hide') Hides a collapsible element. 
$('#identifier').collapse('hide')
 Example The following example demonstrates the usage of methods ? 
<div class = "panel-group" id = "accordion">
   <div class = "panel panel-default">
      
      <div class = "panel-heading">

 Events The following table lists a few events that can be used with the collapse functionality. Event Description Example show.bs.collapse Fired after the show method is called. 
$('#identifier').on('show.bs.collapse', function () {
   // do something
})
 shown.bs.collapse This event is fired when a collapse element has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). 
$('#identifier').on('shown.bs.collapse', function () {
   // do something
})
 hide.bs.collapse Fired when the hide instance method has been called. 
$('#identifier').on('hide.bs.collapse', function () {
   // do something
})
 hidden.bs.collapse This event is fired when a collapse element has been hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). 
$('#identifier').on('hidden.bs.collapse', function () {
   // do something
})

 Bootstrap - Carousel Plugin The Bootstrap carousel is a flexible, responsive way to add a slider to your site. In addition to being responsive, the content is flexible enough to allow images, iframes, videos, or just about any type of content that you might want. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need the carousel.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include the bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Example A simple slideshow below shows a generic component for cycling through the elements like a carousel, using the Bootstrap carousel plugin. To implement the carousel, you just need to add the code with the markup. There is no need for data attributes, just simple class-based development. 
<div id = "myCarousel" class = "carousel slide">
   
   <!-- Carousel indicators -->
   <ol class = "carousel-indicators">
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "0" class = "active"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "1"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "2"></li>
   </ol>   
   
   <!-- Carousel items -->
   <div class = "carousel-inner">
      <div class = "item active">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide1.png" alt = "First slide">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "item">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide2.png" alt = "Second slide">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "item">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide3.png" alt = "Third slide">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <!-- Carousel nav -->
   <a class = "carousel-control left" href = "#myCarousel" data-slide = "prev">&lsaquo;</a>
   <a class = "carousel-control right" href = "#myCarousel" data-slide = "next">&rsaquo;</a>
   
</div> 
 Optional Captions You can add captions to your slides easily with the .carousel-caption element within any .item. Place just about any optional HTML within there and it will be automatically aligned and formatted. The following example demonstrates this ? 
<div id = "myCarousel" class = "carousel slide">
   
   <!-- Carousel indicators -->
   <ol class = "carousel-indicators">
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "0" class = "active"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "1"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "2"></li>
   </ol>   
   
   <!-- Carousel items -->
   <div class = "carousel-inner">
      <div class = "item active">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide1.png" alt = "First slide">
         <div class = "carousel-caption">This Caption 1</div>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "item">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide2.png" alt = "Second slide">
         <div class = "carousel-caption">This Caption 2</div>
      </div>
      
      <div class = "item">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide3.png" alt = "Third slide">
         <div class = "carousel-caption">This Caption 3</div>
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <!-- Carousel nav --> 
   <a class = "carousel-control left" href = "#myCarousel" data-slide = "prev">&lsaquo;</a>
   <a class = "carousel-control right" href = "#myCarousel" data-slide = "next">&rsaquo;</a>+
</div> 
 Usage Via data attributes ? Use data attributes to easily control the position of the carousel. Attribute data-slide accepts the keywords prev or next, which alters the slide position relative to its current position. Use data-slide-to to pass a raw slide index to the carousel data-slide-to = "2", which shifts the slide position to a particular index beginning with 0. The data-ride = "carousel" attribute is used to mark a carousel as an animation starting at page load. Via JavaScript ? The carousel can be manually called with JavaScript as below ? 
$('.carousel').carousel()
 Options There are certain, options which can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript are listed in the following table ? Option Name Type/Default Value Data attribute name Description interval number Default ? 5000 data-interval The amount of time to delay between automatically cycling an item. If false, carousel will not automatically cycle. pause string Default ? "hover" data-pause Pauses the cycling of the carousel on mouseenter and resumes the cycling of the carousel on mouseleave. wrap boolean Default ? true data-wrap Whether the carousel should cycle continuously or have hard stops. Methods Here is a list of useful methods that can be used with carousel code. Method Description Example .carousel(options) Initializes the carousel with an optional options object and starts cycling through items. 
$('#identifier').carousel({
   interval: 2000
})
 .carousel('cycle') Cycles through the carousel items from left to right. 
$('#identifier').carousel('cycle')
 .carousel('pause') Stops the carousel from cycling through items. 
$('#identifier')..carousel('pause')
 .carousel(number) Cycles the carousel to a particular frame (0 based, similar to an array). 
$('#identifier').carousel(number)
 .carousel('prev') Cycles to the previous item. 
$('#identifier').carousel('prev')
 .carousel('next') Cycles to the next item. 
$('#identifier').carousel('next')
 Example The following example demonstrates the usage of methods ? 
<div id = "myCarousel" class = "carousel slide">
   
   <!-- Carousel indicators -->
   <ol class = "carousel-indicators">
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "0" class = "active"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "1"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "2"></li>
   </ol>   
   
   <!-- Carousel items -->
   <div class = "carousel-inner">
      <div class = "item active">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide1.png" alt = "First slide">

      });
      
      // Cycles the carousel to a particular frame 
      $(".slide-one").click(function() {
         $("#myCarousel").carousel(0);
      });
      
      $(".slide-two").click(function() {

 Events Bootstrap's carousel class exposes two events for hooking into carousel functionality which are listed in the following table. Event Description Example slide.bs.carousel This event fires immediately when the slide instance method is invoked. 
$('#identifier').on('slide.bs.carousel', function () {
   // do something
})
 slid.bs.carousel This event is fired when the carousel has completed its slide transition. 
$('#identifier').on('slid.bs.carousel', function () {
   // do something
})
 Example The following example demonstrates the usage of events ? 
<div id = "myCarousel" class = "carousel slide">
   
   <!-- Carousel indicators -->
   <ol class = "carousel-indicators">
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "0" class = "active"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "1"></li>
      <li data-target = "#myCarousel" data-slide-to = "2"></li>
   </ol>   
   
   <!-- Carousel items -->
   <div class = "carousel-inner">
      <div class = "item active">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide1.png" alt = "First slide">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "item">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide2.png" alt = "Second slide">
      </div>
      
      <div class = "item">
         <img src = "/bootstrap/images/slide3.png" alt = "Third slide">
      </div>
   </div>
   
   <!-- Carousel nav -->
   <a class = "carousel-control left" href = "#myCarousel" data-slide = "prev">&lsaquo;</a>
   <a class = "carousel-control right" href = "#myCarousel" data-slide = "next">&rsaquo;</a>
	
</div> 

<script>
   $(function() {
      $('#myCarousel').on('slide.bs.carousel', function () {
         alert("This event fires immediately when the slide instance method" +"is invoked.");
      });
   });
</script>
 Bootstrap - Affix Plugin The affix plugin allows a <div> to become affixed to a location on the page. You can also toggle it's pinning on and off using this plugin. A common example of this are social icons. They will start in a location, but as the page hits a certain mark, the <div> will be locked in place and will stop scrolling with the rest of the page. If you want to include this plugin functionality individually, then you will need the affix.js. Else, as mentioned in the chapter Bootstrap Plugins Overview, you can include the bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js. Usage You can use the affix plugin via data attributes or manually with your own JavaScript as discussed below. Via data attributes ? To easily add affix behavior to any element, just add data-spy = "affix" to the element you want to spy on. Use offsets to define when to toggle the pinning of an element. Example The following example demonstrates the usage through data attributes ? 
<div class = "container">
   <div class = "jumbotron">
      <h1>Bootstrap Affix Plugin example</h1>
   </div>
   
   <div id = "myNav"  data-spy = "affix" data-offset-top = "60" data-offset-bottom = "200">
	
      <div class = "col-md-3">
         <ul class = "nav nav-tabs nav-stacked affix" data-spy = "affix" data-offset-top = "190">
            <li class = "active"><a href = "#one">Tutorial One</a></li>
            <li><a href = "#two">Tutorial Two</a></li>
            <li><a href = "#three">Tutorial Three</a></li>
         </ul>
      </div>

 Via JavaScript ? You can affix an element manually with JavaScript as shown below 
$('#myAffix').affix({
   offset: {
      top: 100, bottom: function () {
         return (this.bottom = $('.bs-footer').outerHeight(true))
      }
   }
})

 Positioning via CSS In both the above situations, you must provide CSS for the positioning of your content. The affix plugin toggles between three classes, each representing a particular state ? .affix, .affix-top, and .affix-bottom. Follow the below steps to set your CSS for either of the above usage options. To start, the plugin adds .affix-top to indicate the element is in its top-most position. At this point no CSS positioning is required. Scrolling past the element you want affixed should trigger the actual affixing. This is where .affix replaces .affix-top and sets position: fixed; (provided by Bootstrap's code CSS). If a bottom offset is defined, scrolling past that should replace .affix with .affix-bottom. Since offsets are optional, setting one requires you to set the appropriate CSS. In this case, add position: absolute; when necessary. Options There are certain options which can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript as listed in the following table ? Option Name Type/Default Value Data attribute name Description offset number | function | object Default: 10 data-offset Pixels to offset from screen when calculating position of scroll. If a single number is provided, the offset will be applied in both the top and bottom directions. To provide a unique, bottom and top offset just provide an object offset: { top: 10 } or offset: { top: 10, bottom: 5 }. Use a function when you need to dynamically calculate an offset.
