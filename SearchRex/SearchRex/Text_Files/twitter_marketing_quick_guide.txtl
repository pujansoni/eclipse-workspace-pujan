Twitter is one of its kind that works on building fraternities of people sharing same or allied business industries and interests, running a campaign for marketing a business, which is far beyond maintaining one’s personal relationships. What is Twitter? Twitter is a social platform for sharing one’s views. The users can open their account with Twitter and broadcast their views in the form of short messages. These messages are popularly known as Tweets. The registered users can write and publish their Tweets. The unregistered users can only see others’ Tweets by following them. The people who follow you can see your Tweets in their list called Twitter Stream. It is not necessary to follow back a person who is following you. How Can I Use Twitter for Marketing? Twitter visitors often visit Twitter out of the motivation to know what is happening in the world overall or with respect to a particular subject. With hundreds of millions of users and over 500 million Tweets being sent each day, there is a great opportunity for businesses to reach a global audience of new and existing customers through Twitter. Conversations on Twitter are just like the face-to-face encounters you have with customers each day. Compelling content helps you attract new followers and keep them engaged over time, building awareness of your brand, and asserting yourself or brand as an authority in your industry or niche. Twitter Terminology Here are some common terms used in the domain of Twitter ? S.No. Term & Meaning 1 @ The @ sign is used to call out usernames in Tweets: "Hello @twitter!"

Twitter Marketing - Account and Profile Twitter being a social media platform can bring you enormous opportunities and potential to connect to the people. On this platform you can share what you want the world to see and want. Let us see how to create twitter account and manage the profile. Creating a Twitter Account To get started, first you’ll need to create an account and set up a profile. Go to the Twitter homepage. Locate the sign up box, which will lead you directly to the signup page. Enter your name, email address, and preferred password. Click on Sign Up. Tips on Selecting a Username When selecting a username, keep these simple tips in mind ? Use a relevant name. Your Twitter name should be relevant to your name or your company's name. Keep it short. The more characters that you use in your username, the less text characters will be used in Tweets directed to you. Be unique. Make your username easy to remember. Note ? You can tie only one email address to one Twitter account. A new page will come appear asking you to select a username. Twitter Account Profile Your Twitter profile shows the world who you are. It’s the first thing the audience will see when they connect with you on Twitter, so it’s important to make sure you get it right. The process below outlines the steps to create a Twitter business page to drive customers to your profile. Every element of your profile ? your photo, header bio and pinned Tweet (optional) ? should reflect your business identity and branding. This is your opportunity to showcase your best work. When designing your profile, view it as a business card. You have little space to put your most important information and make a lasting impact amongst the other online noise. Twitter Account Profile Elements Your Twitter account and profile is composed of these basic elements ? Username Location URL for Primary Website Brief Bio Profile Image Thumbnail - also known as an avatar Cover Image Background, Theme and Design Let’s explore more. Under the Account tab, your username and email address will already be created. Now it’s time to ensure the time zone is accurately represented. Timestamps are applied to all of your Tweets, so this is an important step not to overlook. In the More Info URL field, you’ll want to put the primary website that you’d like to direct visitors of your Twitter profile to if they would like to learn more about you or your brand. Typically, this is a primary business website, but it could also be a Facebook page, LinkedIn page, or a custom page created just for your Twitter audience. You’ll use the One Line Bio field to summarize yourself and your brand to the twitter audience in 160 characters or less. This can be edited at any time. It can be a straight-forward description, or an opportunity to show some of the personality that you want others to understand about your brand. Many recommend using keywords and hashtags in the profile to increase the number of people who find you when they search on Twitter. The Location field can be set to be as specific as you like. This is not only information that your Twitter friends (“tweeps”) will associate with your brand, but search engines will also identify you via this geographic designation. You can opt to not disclose a geographic area, designate a country, state, or city. Alternatively, you can set up Twitter on your mobile device to track your specific GPS location so that your profile location will update to where you are. Tips on Creating a Twitter Marketing Profile Here are few important tips to follow while creating your marketing profile ? Be sure to consider your marketing goals with Twitter when setting the location and choose the most appropriate setting for your audience. You can also choose to Choose to Show my Vine Profile on your Twitter profile (This feature is available only if you've connected your Twitter account to your Vine account). Don’t protect your updates. What’s the point in being on Twitter if people have to jump through hoops to follow you? It completely runs counter to the spirit of community. If you don’t want people to see your Tweets, maybe you should stick to LinkedIn and Facebook where your connections are typically your friends/associates in the real world. Twitter Profile Visuals Now let’s consider the visuals of your Twitter profile. A picture is worth a thousand words and on Twitter. On a social media channel where character count is limited, pictures are of the highest value. Many consider your profile image to be as important as your username on Twitter. The fact is that anyone on Twitter can see your profile image regardless of whether your profile is set to public or not. You can select to use a headshot image, scenery, or a logo, although most agree that images including your personal image tends to be most well received on Twitter. Furthermore, those headshot images that have someone smiling receive more engagement. Here are few recommendations on dimensions of profile images ? Header photo (1500x500 pixels) Profile photo (400x400 pixels) Theme color (only editable on twitter.com) You can customize the way your Twitter should look to you and to others. Under Settings ? Design option, you can get to see the following detailed options ? Other than your theme color, your design theme will not be visible on your profile or Home timeline. Customizing a Twitter Profile If you want to upload your own background image or customize the color scheme of your Tweet detail page, follow the steps below. Sign in to your Twitter account. Go to Settings. Click on the Design tab. Scroll down to the Customize your own section. Click on Change background to upload a background image. Check the box to Tile background if you want the selected picture to repeat across the background. Choose the Background position from left, center, or right. If the image isn't very large, choose the background color that will show behind the image. Choose a theme color Click on Save changes. Note ? Images justify to the top left of the screen. You cannot stretch your image to fit. It will display as the size you uploaded file must be smaller than 2MB. Customizing a Twitter Profile with Premade Theme This is how it goes ? Sign in to your Twitter account. Go to Settings. Click on the Design tab. You will see a Pick a premade theme menu. Select a premade theme of your choice. Click on Save changes at the bottom of the page when you're done. It's as simple as that! Twitter Marketing - The Followers Because everything shared on Twitter remains in the public domain, technically everyone has a voice and can be found on Twitter. However, it’s by curating the right followers you actually get heard by the mass audience. Like any friendship, a good relationship on Twitter is earned by participating in conversations, substantive information, and giving back to the community. Although it’s easy to get wrapped in the numbers of how many followers you have, this is really an opportunity where oftentimes quality can outrank quantity. It’s important to realize that there can be many motives for participating in the Twitter community - to socialize, network, debate, learn, enrich, promote, and entertain. Most probably engage for many of these reasons. Components of Twitter Twitter consists of three components ? You Your followers (those who follow you) Your following (those whom you follow) Why am I on Twitter? An obvious question a twitter account holder often tackles is, why am I on Twitter? The best way to figure out how to search is by defining some keywords that define the type of Twitter user you’d like to engage with. These keywords should be those that you’d use in the content of a Tweet or that you would hope those that would read your Twitter content to be interested in. With these keywords, it’s time to start searching for Tweeps (Twitter-friends) that are already chatting about these topics. After typing in your keywords into the search bar, Tweets will pop in search results in chronological order. Note, that under the More Options tab, you will have the opportunity to Save this Search for convenience. From here you have the opportunity to review the content, and if relevant to learn more about the user that shared the Tweet. Like what you see? Click on Follow. Depending on how specialized your marketing needs are and your industry niche, screening potential Twitter Tweeps may be a non-discriminatory process to collect a higher number of followers, or you may be quite selective to create a highly curated, active, and engaging audience. Considerations to Follow Others on Twitter The considerations when selecting those to follow (and things that others are looking at when they consider following you) are ? Does their bio indicate common interests? What is the ratio of followers versus following? Those with tons of followers but are following few are less likely to follow you back. How recent are their Tweets and are they Tweeting often? Is there anything from a recent Tweet in their feed that you can comment to and engage with? If you like the answers to the questions, start making friends… Click on Follow. Twitter will allow you to follow up to 2,000 people with no limits. After you reach this milestone, however, you have to get a certain number of those to follow you back before your following limit is increased. Twitter Marketing - Plain Tweets Attracting followers is harder than following on Twitter. The best place to start, however, is by jumping in the conversation. Those who Tweet more have more followers. But not just because of the sheer number of Tweets they send – but the content quality matters. Sending a Tweet from Twitter As found on Twitter.com, to send a basic Tweet, follow the given steps ? Sign in to your Twitter account. Type your Tweet into the textbox at the top of your Home timeline. Optionally, click on Tweet button in the top navigation bar. Make sure your update is fewer than 140 characters. Twitter counts them for you. Remaining characters are shown as a number below the textbox. Click on Tweet button to post the Tweet to your profile. You will immediately see your Tweet in the timeline on your homepage. Deleting a Tweet Make a mistake? Twitter can help you delete a Tweet you sent ? Sign in to your Twitter account. Visit your Profile page. Locate the Tweet you want to delete. Click the More icon (•••). Click Delete Tweet. Done! Your Tweet has been deleted. Note ? You cannot delete a Tweet sent by an account that you do not own. A few vital points as you start? If you receive a Tweet, reply back. Keep in mind what your twitter feed looks like. Just like any other social media channel, you want to make sure that what you are sharing en-suite reflects your marketing needs and strategy. If you are sharing a content from another source, be sure to include the twitter handle of the content owner. Not only will they appreciate knowing that you shared their content, they might even thank you for it and follow you back! Leave room for extra characters. Sure, you have 140 characters to use, but you might want to spare a few. Leaving extra characters at the end of your Tweet will enable others to retweet your content without having to edit it. Be mindful of hashtags. They help search, but using too many hashtags can also be seen as spam. Twitter Marketing - Image & Video Posts Everyone present on the Internet knows that images and videos take us closer to the real life experience than mere textual contents. Images and videos are a great way to draw attention to the content you share on Twitter and are very easy to insert into your Tweets. Let us see, how ?

When you add a photo, a shortened website link appears in your Tweet that your followers can click to see your photo. The website link for your photo will use a portion of the 140 characters allowed for a Tweet. If the character count for your Tweet is below 0 after adding your photo, shorten the characters so the link for your photo will be displayed in the Tweet completely. Tagging People in Twitter You can also tag people in photos by following the given steps ? Tap on Who’s in this photo?. Type in a full name of the person or @username. Tap on Done. Tags appear on photos in Tweets (as opposed to mentions which appear in the type of Tweet). Note ? Twitter accepts GIF, JPEG, and PNG files. Photos can be up to 5MB; animated GIFs can be up to 3MB. In-stream photos are shown at 440x220 pixels. Twitter Video Posts Twitter enables you to use videos to tell your story in real-life manner. By posting videos, you can connect to large audience and gradually grow it further. Twitter allots 30 seconds to capture a video as that is the best long a video should be. If it extends more than 30 seconds, it is observed that the audience loses its interest and might discontinue viewing it. Another great way to connect with your customers is replying to a Tweet with a video. You can put a face to a brand, show how to quickly use a product or address a specific question. Sharing Videos on Twitter There are three ways to share videos on Twitter ? Recording ?

Twitter Marketing - Hashtags The # symbol, called a hashtag, is used to mark keywords or topics in a Tweet. It was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages. People use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase (no spaces) in their Tweet to categorize those Tweets and help them show more easily in Twitter Search. Clicking on a hashtagged word in any message shows you all other Tweets marked with that keyword. Hashtags can occur anywhere in the Tweet – at the beginning, middle, or end; and can even become trending topics on Twitter. Considerations of Using Hashtags in Twitter A few key points regarding hashtags are ? If you Tweet with a hashtag on a public account, anyone who does a search for that hashtag may find your Tweet. Don’t #spam #with #hashtags. Don’t over-tag a single Tweet. Use hashtags only on Tweets relevant to the topic. Types of Twitter Hashtags There are the following prominent types and ways of using the hashtags ? Brand Hashtags Brand hashtags can be created to represent your brand consistently on Twitter. You’ll always use the same hashtag no matter what you are promoting. You create your own brand hashtag. Make it your company name, or a tagline that people know (or will know) about your business. Use it as your central business tag, that you - and your customers - can use anytime, and on any social site. Campaign Hashtags Campaign hashtags are used for each of your marketing campaigns and will have a relative short lifespan. For a campaign tag, make it a word or phrase that is unique to your shortterm contest or promotion Trending Hashtags A trending hashtag is nothing but a very popular hashtag topic. You probably know people talking about What’s trending now?; means they are referring to the hashtags that are the most talked about right now. Trending hashtags are changed continuously in real time. For example, a top 10 trends can set and vanish within minutes. When you see your business related trend, you can engage in it by using this tag. Content Hashtags These are the hashtags you can use in your posts. They are not branded and they are not used to define your business or marketing. They may or may not be trending. Content hashtags improve the SEO of your posts. Event Hashtags Event-based hashtags can be cool to include in a content update. An event could be anything from a local community fair, to a well-known global celebration, to a live product launch or a live webinar you’re hosting online. Location hashtags If you are a locally based business, you need to connect with your local customers. Use specific geo-targeted hashtags to get your business known in your city. Twitter Marketing - Retweets A retweet is a simple way to re-post someone else's Tweet. By retweeting, you can share another user's content to your followers and the Twitter community at large. There is no limit for the number of retweets a single Tweet can have, however, Twitter will only display the most recent 100 retweets. Also, retweets are counted against a user's 1,000 Tweet per day limit. How to Recognize Re-Tweets? According to Twitter.com ? Retweets look like normal Tweets with the author's name and username next to it, but are distinguished by the Retweet icon and the name of the user who retweeted the Tweet. If you see a message from a stranger in your timeline, look for retweeted by info in the Tweet — the retweeter should be someone you follow Sometimes people type RT at the beginning of a Tweet to indicate that they are reposting someone else's content. This isn't an official Twitter command or feature, but signifies that they are quoting another user's Tweet. Retweets may appear differently in third-party applications, and will show up in apps only if they are using Twitter's Retweet API. Many apps have built in their own version of retweeting — those Tweets are not treated as official Retweets on Twitter. To test, try retweeting from your favorite app, then check your profile on the web. Where do Retweets Appear? Here is where you can get to see the different tweets ? Tweets Retweeted by Your Followers You can see Retweets your followers have retweeted in your Home timeline. Retweets, like regular Tweets, will not show up from people you've blocked. Tweets that You Retweeted If you retweet someone you follow, it will be visible on your profile timeline. If you retweet someone you do not follow, it will be visible on both your home and profile timelines. Your Tweets that Others Retweeted Go to Notifications in the top navigation bar. In the Notifications section you will see all activity concerning your Tweets — including which have recently been retweeted and by whom Turning Retweets Off You can turn off Retweets for a specific user if you don’t like what they share. Select Turn off Retweets from the gear icon drop-down menu on a user's profile. Turning Retweets on or off is not retroactive; means you can't remove Retweets that are already in your timeline. It is not possible to turn off ALL Retweets from ALL users. Undoing or Deleting Retweets You can undo a Retweet you've made by clicking on Retweeted in the Tweet. This will remove the retweet from your timeline, but will not delete the original Tweet. Why Can't Some Tweets be Retweeted? Here are some reasons why some tweets can’t be retweeted ? If another user's Tweets are protected, you will not be able to retweet their content. If you see the Lock icon next to the user's name and information on their profile page or on their Tweets, their Tweets are protected and you will not be able to share their Tweets on your timeline through Twitter's Retweet feature. You can see their Tweets in your timeline because they have accepted your follow request, but because they have chosen not to share their Tweets publicly, their Tweets cannot be retweeted by you or anyone else. You cannot retweet your own Tweet. However, if your Tweets are public, others will be able to retweet you. Twitter Marketing - Lists A List on Twitter is a compiled group of Twitter users.

Viewing users will be able to follow and view the profiles of attributed accounts directly from the card. You’ll have the option to choose between Website Attribution and Creator Attribution. Website Attribution Indicates the Twitter account for the website or platform on which the content was published. Note that a service may set separate Twitter accounts for different pages/sections of their website, and the most appropriate Twitter account should be used to provide the best context for the user.

Summary Card ? Title, description, thumbnail, and Twitter account attribution Summary Card with Large Image ? Similar to a Summary Card, but with a prominently featured image. App Card ?

After testing in the validator or approval of your Player Card, Tweet the URL and see the Card appear below your Tweet in the details view. Use Twitter Card analytics to measure your results. Once the tags are live, you can test your Card using the Twitter Card Validator. Keep in mind that most cards are unexpanded in the twitter feed, so you need to make the tweet compelling enough to have a viewer click to see more.

Summary Cards The Summary Card can be used for many kinds of web content, from blog posts and news articles, to products and services. It is designed to give the reader a preview of the content before clicking through to your website. Example of a Tweet with a Summary Card ?

Also, you should not require users to sign in to your experience. Example of a Player Card on Twitter Twitter Marketing - Defining Strategy Every marketing activity you perform, from tweeting and texting to cold-calling, should be done for the sole purpose of accomplishing your brand’s end goals. You should have a regular rotation of content that will be discoverable and interesting to the people with related business interests and goals using the approaches above. What Should I Share on Twitter? Many of the questions you should be asking yourself when deciding what to share on Twitter that will resonate with your target audience are going to seem obvious ? What industries am I targeting? Who needs whatever value I am providing? What are their demographics? What key terms are they searching to solve their problems? Are my customers/clients/community members restricted to a certain geolocation? Many marketers employ the 80/20 principle when engaging on twitter. 80% of your Tweets should focus on driving interactions with your followers, such as Retweets, replies, and likes. Once you build some rapport, you can mix in direct offers or promotions that get followers to take actions, such as clicking on a link or making a purchase from your website. Knowing Performance of Tweets Be aware of how your followers react to your content. Certain tools allow you to track who unfollows you on Twitter. With unfollowstats.com for example, you can opt to receive daily digests on how people are interacting with you on Twitter, including follows and unfollows. You may not know the exact reason someone unfollowed you, but you may be able to gain insight into the cause. No matter what social-sharing platform you’re using, it should offer data on how your Tweets are performing. Both Buffer and Hootsuite provide ways to see a quick snapshot of how the Tweets are performing. Building the Brand on Twitter If you want real success on Twitter and you want to build your brand on Twitter, there are a few key pointers to employ ? Use your brand name as your Twitter name. It may seem obvious, but it needs to be reminded. If branding a company is your topmost priority, use your logo as your Twitter portfolio photo. You should Tweet 10 to 20 times a day to keep your brand name in the Twitter stream. Schedule the Tweets that have links to valuable content and complement that with 10 or so personalized Tweets where you are interacting with other Twitter users. Reply to Everything! Really, everything. Learn to give. To build a strong brand on Twitter you will need to give back as much as you get. Share content from your tweeps, retweet, and favorite relevant content. Follow at least two new people a day. Follow back anyone who followed you. It’s the best way to keep the followers! Click on Followers and then follow anyone in your stream that you are not connected with. Boosting Business Credibility on Twitter Your username affects perceptions of the credibility of your message. Research shows that messages coming from topical usernames (PsychologyForGrowth, AllScience) received a higher credibility rating than traditional names (Alex_Brown), and much higher than internet names (tenacious27, crazydog33). Here are some tips on credibility boosting ? Whatever you write in the Bio section of your profile, should reflect your ideas and Tweets that you share. Remember that unfollowing someone takes a lot less decision than to follow someone. Always use a headshot (unless you’re a branded business) of yourself, and try to smile as it helps to convey your personality more. Non-standard grammar is the greatest hampering factor in credibility on Twitter. If you want to be seen as credible, avoid wrtng msgs with shrtr wrds or fewr letrs. People hate being spammed or sold to. Provide real value to your followers by giving away great free content. Answer questions. Write articles. Share videos. Retweet other people’s content that is relevant to your market place. Your followers will recognize your Tweets as valuable and useful to them, and will be much more likely to keep track of your Tweets in the future. Find the other authorities within your niche or related niches and become twitter friends with them. Then become real friends with them. Interacting with the other authorities means you can retweet their content, keep up-to-date with the current trends and paves the way for joint ventures etc. Twitter Marketing - Reputation Management Good reputation has far more value than money. A substantial reduction in negative word of mouth can boost sales. Managing your reputation on Twitter is crucial, if you are using Twitter to market your product, business, or brand. Using Google Alerts for Reputation Management Google Alerts is a great tool to ensure you don’t let an online mention of your brand go unnoticed. You need to follow these simple steps ? Go to the Google Alerts website. Enter your company name, brand, or other industry keywords in the Search Terms text box. Save it as an Everything alert type. You can thus receive daily notifications of all news articles, websites, blogs, videos, and groups that mention your keywords. Using IFTTT for Reputation Management Another resource is If This Then That (IFTTT), which automates simple online tasks by using one of the most basic principles: If this happens, then do that. IFTTT lets you set up rules (called recipes) for everything from getting the latest weather updates as a text message to automatically sending Instagram photos to Twitter (or any other platform). You can create a recipe by choosing a trigger channel (the “if this happens” part) and an action channel (the “then do that” part). To monitor what people are saying about your company, set up a recipe that scans RSS feeds of important industry websites, then sends you a daily email alert with the results—IF [website] mentions your company, THEN receive an email alert. Social Mention returns results based on the sentiment of social media buzz around your company. You can monitor multiple websites in one place and even find out which keywords people use when talking about your company. To set up Social Mention monitoring, type your search term(s) in the text box and choose a channel such as blog, microblog, bookmark, image, video, or question. You can sort results by date, source, and time.
