The Magento architecture comes with Models, Views and Controllers. User Request ? The user sends a request to a server in the form of request message where web browsers, search engines, etc. act like clients. View ? View represents the data in particular format. It is the user interface which is responsible for displaying the response for user request. It specifies an idea behind the presentation of the model's data to the user. Views are used to reflect "how your data should look like". Controller ? The controller is responsible for responding to user input and perform interactions on the data model objects. It uses models to process the data and send responses back to the view. Model ? The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It contains logic of the data and represents basic data object in the framework. It responds to request from the view and to the instructions from the controller to update itself. Database ? Database contains the information which is requested from the user. When the user requests data, view sends requests to the controller, the controller requests from the model and the model fetches the required information from the database and responds to the user. WSDL ? WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language. It is used for describing web services and how to access them.
