Just as there are so many notes or colors, there are only so many flavors – it’s how you combine them that sets you apart. …Wolfgang Puck, American Chef, Restaurateur, and Occasional Actor. Food Production and its related operations are integral elements of hospitality management, hotel management, and restaurant businesses. It requires a skilled staff who can produce a wide variety of quality foods. In addition, the culinary staff of a hotel or a restaurant is also required to produce food in a large quantity. Let us start with understanding the basic term ‘Cookery’ in detail. What is Cookery? Cookery is an art and science of preparing food for consumption by using heat. Cookery is an age-old practice. A primitive human must have found a piece of meat or vegetable cooked in the bushfire by chance. He must have found it edible, chewable and easy to consume. Probably, he even must not have cooked deliberately until he knew how to create fire. The simplest method of cooking was holding a piece of meat or vegetable in the fire directly, which is still in practice, with a little sophistication. From the age-old cooking practices to cooking for fine dining, cookery has come a long way with the evolution of humans, their skills, diverse cultures, and the equipment. Today, cookery is an inseparable part of our lives that rules our tongues and hearts. Why Cook Food? We can have some foods in the raw form too, such as salads and fruits but we need to cook certain foods such as beans and meat to make them edible. In addition, if we eat some vegetables without cooking, they can transfer harmful bacteria or substances into our bodies. For example, uncooked beans contain anti-digestive enzymes. Uncooked capsicum (Bell Pepper) contains Capsaicin that can create burning of stomach lining. Cooking helps to destroy unwanted substances present in the food and unwelcomed effects of consuming it. There are many reasons behind cooking food. Some of them are ? To make the food digestible. To kill any harmful bacteria present in it. To make appearance of the food pleasant. To change its physical and chemical form. Let us now see the organization of the Kitchen Department. Kitchen Staff (Brigade de Cuisine) The kitchen staff (brigade de cuisine) needs to work harmoniously to avoid possibility of any error. The kitchen staff is organized in the following way ? The responsibilities of kitchen staff are as follows ? S.No. Role & Responsibilities 1 Chef de Cuisine Main cook. Overall management of kitchen and staff, supervising, creating new recipes, and training apprentice. 2 Sous Chef Deputy cook. Takes charge in the absence of Executive cook. 3 Chef Tournant Has skills and knowledge of every section.

Design Considerations of a Commercial Kitchen Since a large quantity and variety of food is produced in the professional kitchens, various designs are considered before setting up a kitchen. The food production managers must consider the following factors with respect to the kitchen. Restaurant menu and service types Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning Employee workflow Storage, food production, cleaning, and service space Equipment Drainage and plumbing Communication among employees Safety of employees and property Typical Layouts of a Commercial Kitchen Some typical layouts of a commercial kitchen are given below. Island Layout In this type of layout, the cooking ranges, ovens and other cooking equipment are placed together at the center of the kitchen. The other sections are placed along the wall in order to follow a concentric design. Any section can be an island depending on the requirements. It is an open layout that favors staff communication. It also leaves an adequate open floor space for cleaning. This layout is followed in large kitchens. Zonal Layout The total kitchen space is divided into different zones for various activities. The principle equipment are located along the walls. This layout follows an appropriate order. In this layout, staff communication and supervision are easy as the central space is completely open. Assembly Line Layout In this layout, kitchen equipment is organized in a row. The food preparation space is kept at one end and the service space at the other. The areas for cleaning/washing and storage/receiving are behind the assembly line to keep them separate from the main busy space. This allows the cooks to send the food quickly down the line. This layout provides very high efficiency, and excellent communication and workflow. This layout is very effective in case of the establishments with a limited menu with large momentum. Terms Used in Food Production Operations Here are some common terms used in the domain of Food Production and Operations ?

Food Operations – Kitchen Equipment & Fuel Good kitchen equipment is expensive but most items last a lifetime and will pay for themselves over and over again. …Delia Smith, English Cook and TV Personality. Commercial kitchen equipment need to produce food for a large number of consumers. It needs to be robust, durable, and easy to operate. The equipment should consume less electricity, improve the productivity of food production operations, and must be eco-friendly. Last but not the least, it should serve its purpose effectively. Most kitchen equipment are operated electronically. There is a wide range of cooking, cutting, baking, and cleaning equipment available for the kitchen staff. Let us introduce ourselves to some typical kitchen equipment. Commercial Food Production Equipment Here are some basic food production equipment. Burners They are used for cooking, boiling, and steaming. They often operate on Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). Now induction burners and hot plates are available, which operate on electricity. They come with open top, mesh top, or flat top. Cooking Ranges Cooking range is the most versatile equipment operating on either LPG or electricity. The name implies, it can perform a range of functions such as cooking, frying, boiling, grilling, and baking. It comes in two basic versions ? Restaurant range ? Less expensive, good for less food volume, and is stand alone. Heavy duty range ? Expensive, suits a large volume of food production, and can be banked with other ranges using a battery. Cooking ranges come with multiple burners usually 4 to 8, depending upon the volume of food to be handled. Ovens They are used for cooking, baking, roasting, and browning. They operate either on LPG or electricity. There are various oven models such as Rack with the option of rotating or steady racks, Deck, and Tunnel depicting their shape and working style. Rack oven ? It contains a set of stacked racks often placed equidistant, one above the other in a tall stainless steel frame. This oven is good to produce large volume of food items such as breads, cookies, and croissants. Deck oven ? It contains racks or rotisseries that can cook various meats such as chicken, duck, lamb, etc. simultaneously and evenly. They also come in baking deck and pizza deck variants. The number of decks are generally up to four. Tunnel oven ? It comes in direct heat and indirect heat variants. It is suitable for high temperature baking. There are myriad number of ovens available in the market, which vary according to the energy they consume, the manner of heating food, sizes, and shapes. Griddles They are flat plates made of iron, stainless steel, or aluminium, which transfer heat to the food. Griddles are prone to heat loss when the plate is partially unused. They are mainly used for preparing breakfast items such as omelets, scrambled eggs, patties, sandwiches, burgers, and pancakes. Normally, the residual grease needs to be wiped out occasionally from the surface to prevent tempering. In case of steel griddles, caramelization occurs if the surface is not kept clean. Teflon surface griddles are more durable and efficient. Pans and Cooking Spoons There are a wide range of pans, pots, and spoons used for cooking. Pans ? Depending upon the type of cooking, the cook selects a pan. The pans serve the purpose of shallow frying, boiling, and stir frying. Pots ? The pots are used for cooking and preparing stocks. They are generally accompanied with lids. The steamer is used to prepare steamed food such as rice, momos, and idlis (fluffy rice dumplings). There are two variants ? shallow and deep. Spoons ? The spoons help to check the thickness of liquids, tenderness of solids, stir, and turn the food in the pots and pans. Various spoons used during cooking are skimmer, turner, masher, ladle, fork-spoon, and utility spoon. Kettles The kettles are used for cooking, warming, and storing food. They are two layered pots- one inside the other with a gap in between for steam. They are usually jacketed, agitator tilting for better view and food handling. The kettles also have a product discharge valve that provides an efficient transfer of kettle product to a service area without damaging delicate food items. Deep kettles are best for soups, gravies, spaghetti sauces, pie fillings, and puddings as the quality of these food items remains the same irrespective of their volume and frequent stirring. Lentils, beans, and pasta can be cooked in deep kettles. The shallow kettles are best for cooking and warming stews, patties, steamed vegetables, where this kettle offers better view and less food handling. Vegetable Cutters/Choppers The cutters or choppers are used in cutting, dicing, shredding, and slicing vegetables in various shapes and sizes. They are also used to cut bread into small pieces for puddings or soups. The handheld cutters are used for cutting fruits, salads, etc. for presentation. Cutters are made of either plastic or stainless steel. Some cutters come with single or multiple wheels with zig-zag or plain edge. Some cutters have round small bowl-like shape to cut round pieces of fruits. Mixers The overhead motor vertical mixer is most commonly used in commercial food production units. Mixers are used for mixing and blending. There are broadly two types of mixers ? table mounted and floor mounted. Mixers have the following standard accessories ? Flat beater ? Mashing and beating foods of medium consistency such as boiled potatoes. Wire whipper ? whipping cream, eggs, frosts and other light foods that contain air. It works on high speed. Dough arm ? It handles heavy and bulky ingredients such as bread dough at low speed. Cookers and Steamers Commercial cookers and steamers largely operate on electricity. The cooks use these for cooking rice, lentils, and vegetables. The steamers are used for preparing steamed food such as Idli (a type of fluffy rice dumpling), momos, and dhokla. Fryer Some food items are prepared by immersing them in heated oil in a fryer. There are two basic versions of a fryer ? Electric fryer and Gas fryer. The frying time and oil temperature varies directly with the food type and the size of the fryer. It consists of a fryer basket and heating element and a thermostat controls a fryer. The fryers are used to fry potato chips, Pooris (fried Indian bread), doughnuts, begels, onion rings, shrimp, fish, chicken, okra, and zucchini. Juicer Juicers extract juices and pulps from fruits and vegetables. It operates on electricity and speeds up the juice production process. The fruits are added in the juicer from the top. It separates the juice and left over peels and unused fibers from the fruits. There are three types of juicers ? Centrifugal ? It works by crushing fruits. It is quick and yields plain juice. Masticating ? It works longer to yield juice of specified texture and consistency. Twin-gear ? It uses various gears and membranes to yield best quality juice of almost any fruit, carrot, tomato, or leafy vegetables. It also helps to prevent oxidation of the juice. It is very useful in preparing juices and pulps for breakfast, for meals as appetizers, and for using them in cocktails, mocktails, and smoothies. Maintenance Equipment in Commercial Kitchen We will discuss here a few important maintenance equipment used in professional kitchens. Dish Washer It can wash multiple dishes and bowls simultaneously. It is an automatic machine but needs human interaction for loading used dishes into dish racks and unloading clean dishes after wash cycle. It eliminates a great effort required for traditional dish washing. There are two basic types of dishwasher ? Door-type ? It is large machine. It can clean from 50 to 125 dish racks depending upon the size of the machine. Under-counter ? It is smaller and can fit under the kitchen platform. Both dishwashers give sparkling clean dishes. Glass Washer It washes and dries almost 2000 glasses per hour. There are two types of glass washers ? rotary and pass-through. They are mostly used at bars for washing glasses of various shapes meant for various beverages. Dish Warmer It can dry as many as 1800 dishes an hour and eliminates the possibility of contamination caused by conventional drying methods. It conducts speedy washing of dishes. It also keeps the micro organic particles depositing at bay for long time. Special Equipment in Commercial Kitchen There are a few special equipment used in commercial kitchen to make the tasks easy. Nut cracker It is used to crack the shells of hard nuts such as almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, pine nuts, palm nuts, and pistachio. Some machines are also capable of shelling watermelon and pumpkin seeds, and peeling peanuts, cashew nuts and almonds. Shredders A shredder cuts the fruits and vegetables into string-like fine pieces, which are useful in salads and vegetarian cookery. Kitchen Knives Knives are used across various small volume dicing, cutting, slicing, carving, and filleting. There are various knives used for different cutting and carving purposes ? Paring knife ? It is used for fine cutting work, removing onion skins, and cutting small fruits. Utility knife ? It is used in general purpose cutting and scraping. Steak knife ? It is used for cutting steaks. Santoku knife ? Originated in Japan, this knife is used for cutting, dicing, and mincing. (Santoku = Three virtues) Chef’s General knife ? It is a multi-purpose knife used on multiple commodities such as vegetables, fruits, meat, and poultry. Serrated knife (Bread Knife) ? It has a long thin blade with serrated edge that provides sawing-like motion. It is used to slice certain foods with firm skins or outer layers such as bread, tomatoes, and capsicums. Boning/Filleting knives ? They come with a narrow, sharp, and flexible blade and a protruding heel near the handle. They can run along the bones of flat fish or ribs smoothly. Carving knife ? This knife comes with a long, thin and sharp blade to ensure neat and accurate cutting. Slicing knife ? It has a long sharp blade that tapers at the end and helps slicing fruits and vegetables finely. Turning knife ? It is an essential component to present the food in a unique way. This knife has a small curved blade that is used to carve the vegetables into the shape of a container. Cleaver ? It is a butchers’ knife. It is very strong and sharp to cut through large pieces of meat such as pork and beef. Now let us see the fuels typically used in commercial kitchen for cooking. Fuels and Energy Used for Cooking Fuel is a prime necessity in cookery. There are various types of fuels used for cooking food. Mainly two types of fuels are used in food production ? Solid fuels and Liquid fuels. Wood Fuel It can be acquired from logs, wood chips, and bamboo pellets. Seasoned logs are more popular in commercial kitchen as they contain less moisture. The more the moisture, more is the smoke created while burning. Though it is easily available, it requires a separate storage space at commercial food production end. Its calorific value is around 3500 Kcal/kg for moist wood and up to 4700 Kcal/kg for dry wood. Charcoal It is obtained by slow heating of wood, animal or vegetable remains in the absence of oxygen. Charcoal is easily available and widely accepted as commercial cooking fuel. It produces less smoke than wood fuel. It also requires separate storage space. Its calorific value is around 7500 Kcal/kg. Solid fuels are useful in direct heating ovens, three stone stoves, tandoor, and barbeques. This fuel can emit carbon or ash particles while burning. Solid fuels give gradual heating. The initial cost is low. It also gives a tempting smoky aroma to the baked/roasted food. Liquid Propane It is nothing but LPG, a mixture of propane and butane gases that exist in liquid state at room temperature. The LPG is highly inflammable and burns with a blue flame without emitting smoke, and it can be controlled precisely. Its calorific value is around 1000 Kcal/kg. Kerosene It is also a petroleum product used in commercial kitchens for cooking. The liquid fuels produce heat almost instantly. The initial cost can be high. They are convenient to use but risky if proper safety precautions are not followed while handling these fuels. Electricity Though electricity is considered as an alternative fuel under energy power, it is the most commonly used heat energy for cooking. Most of the commercial cooking appliances operate on electricity. Electricity provides instant heating. The heat can be regulated as per the requirement. It is easy to access, though the initial cost of wiring may be considerable. Food Production Operations - Veg Cookery To be interested in food but not in food production is clearly absurd! …Wendell Berry, American environmentalist, a Poet and a Farmer. Vegetarian cookery involves preparing food by using cereals, grains, lentils, vegetables, fruits, soya, tofu, seeds, spices, herbs, and nuts. Animal products such as milk, curd and honey are also used in this cookery. Vegetables are very important ingredients in various cuisines around the world. Vegetarian cookery provides a wide range of eye-pleasing colors, texture, fiber, and vitamins. It also provides low calories as compared to non-vegetarian cookery. Introduction to Grains Grains are small dry seeds consumed worldwide. They are popular as one of the important ingredients of vegetarian cookery due to their nutrient value and ease of availability. The grains are of two types ? Cereals They are the seeds obtained from various grass plants such as Wheat, Rice, Barley, Ragi (Malt), Jowar, Bajra, Maize, and Millet. In most of the countries, they are consumed as a part of staple food. Pulses They are the seeds obtained from vain and shrub plants such as peas, Bengal Gram, Horse Peas, Chick Peas, and Indian Beans.

They are best when consumed cooked. Some vegetables such as sun-dried tomatoes are used in Italian cuisines. To make pickles, vegetables are often for longer shelf life. Vegetables are often used not only in fresh form but also in dried or pickled form. Classification of Vegetables In vegetarian cooking, vegetables are the prime ingredients. Let us see their classification on the basis of their place in the context of plant structure. Leafy Vegetables They are the leaves of the vegetable plant. They can be either consumed directly or cooked. They can be used in salads for direct consumption, in gravies, soups, and other foods. They have short shelf life, say a couple of days. For example, fenugreek, spinach, dill, curry leaves, cilantro, parsley, mint, oregano, thyme, basil, and leeks of onion and garlic. These vegetables may have pests on the back of their leaves. Hence while selecting the fresh and good quality leafy vegetable, the buyer needs to be careful. In addition, they must be cleansed thoroughly before using to wash off any pesticides present on the leaves. Root Vegetables They are the roots of the plant. For example, Radish, beet root, turnip, Malanga, and carrot. They can be consumed raw or cooked after cleaning off the soil properly. Root vegetables must be preferably peeled before using. They are used for preparing stews, side dishes and salads. Stem Vegetables They are the useful stems of the plant and have high quantity of mass. They can be cut, chopped, or diced. They can be consumed raw or cooked. Their shelf life is longer than leafy vegetables but shorter than bulb vegetables. For example, Asparagus and lotus stem. The North Indians use lotus stem in pickles. Tuber Vegetables Tuber vegetables are the swollen part of the stem that grows underground. Potatoes are used all over the world in a wide range of cuisines. Fresh ginger and turmeric are used to prepare pickles and pastes. For example, Potato, Ginger, Turmeric, and artichoke are some of the stems, which grow underground. Fruit Vegetables They are the fruits of a plant and are called culinary fruits. They grow in large quantity. Some of them can be eaten raw and rest all need cooking. They need to be cleaned, cut into pieces, and grilled or cooked for consumption. The chefs require to pay extra attention while cutting for the presence of any pests inside these vegetables. For example, Eggplant, green chilies, coconut, Ladies finger (okra), tomatoes, cucumber, various types of gourds, pumpkin, and various colored bell peppers (capsicums), drumsticks. Fruit vegetables are used to make stock, soups, and stews. Bud Vegetables They are prominently the bud part of their plant. For example, Lettuce and cabbage. They appear as if unopen or bloomed at the time of their harvesting. They are mostly consumed directly. Lettuce is used in sandwiches and salads. Cabbage is an important ingredient in South Asian cuisines. Bulb Vegetables A bulb is an underground part of the plant where nutrients are stashed. These bulbs are one of the main ingredients in cookery. They are used to flavor soups and stews. They are also used in seasoning various dishes. They have longer shelf life than any other type of vegetable. For example, onion and garlic. Flower Vegetables They are the flowers of vegetable plant. They are cut into pieces and cooked to make stews. They also need thorough washing to remove the pests or tiny insects. For example, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Moringa (Flower of drumstick plant), Artichoke. Fungi Vegetable Commonly used fungi is mushroom. They are consumed as staple diet all over the world. There are many types of edible mushrooms with various shapes and colors. Mushrooms are also used in preparation of sauce. Fruits used in Cuisines The fruits are dominant ingredient in fruit salads, smoothies, desserts, and gravies. They are best when consumed ripe and fresh. In Asian subcontinents, some fruits like raw jackfruit and papaya are cooked into stew. Raw bananas are used to make crispy chips. Raw mango and ripe tamarind are dried and powdered to use in Indian kitchen. Sweet fruits and berries are preserved in sugar syrup to increase their shelf life. They are also used as ingredients in dessert preparation. Classification of Fruits Fruits can be divided into the following categories depending on the context of their culinary prospects. Pulpy Fruits They are mostly hard in raw form and become tender when they ripe. These fruits yield soft pulp of thick consistency when crushed. The pulp is often used in preparing desserts, cakes, tarts, pies, candies, ice creams, and smoothies. For example, Mango, Papaya, banana, muskmelon, pineapple, custard apple, wood apple, mud apple, kiwi, fig, passion fruit, apple, pear, and plum. Some pulpy fruits such as fig and passionfruit have small soft seeds, which bring crunchiness; but some fruits like guava and wood apple contain multiple small and hard seeds. Such seeds need to be separated while getting pure pulp of the fruit. Juicy Fruits These fruits give juice of thin consistency when squeezed or crushed. The juice is strained to separate any small fruit particles left while crushing. The clear juice is then used for sorbets, mocktails, and organic colored ice cubes. Juices are combined with corn syrup and sugar to prepare juice drinks and fruit nectars or nectar blends. Citrus Fruits ? These fruits are often divided into segments that contain small sacks filled with juice. Citrus fruits contain Citric Acid, a natural preservative that adds sour taste to the sweet ripen fruit. They have leathery and colorful outer peel. Their peel (also called zest) has a strong aroma. The zest is often used in cuisines for presentation and in preparing marmalades. Some citrus fruits are shown below Non-Citrus fruits ? They are non-acidic alkaline fruits. Ripen non-citrus fruits taste sweeter than ripen citrus fruits. Here are some non-citrus fruits ? Dry Fruits They are fruits with no water content. Their water is removed by either natural or artificial method of drying. They shrink with mild change in color after drying and have longer shelf life than fresh fruits. For example, Raisins are made by drying good quality grapes. Dried Apricots, Figs, Kiwis, (Prunes) and Dates are the most common varieties of dry fruits. Dry fruits are used in ice creams, and healthy milk based cold drinks. They are best paired with chocolates and cakes. They are used in preparing desserts and presentation of food. Berries They are small, pulpy and juicy fruits of bright glossy colored peels. They are consumed worldwide. They can be eaten fresh or used in preparing tarts, pies, cakes, and candies. Some of them are used in preparing jams and sweet pickles. Here are some berries ? Vegetable Stock and Broth Stock is a flavored liquid obtained by boiling vegetables in water or other liquid such as wine. It is the basis of soups and sauces. In classic vegetarian stock preparation, the chef often simmers portions of vegetables such as carrots, onions, garlic, pumpkin, and celery (often called mirepoix) accompanied with a small porous bag of cotton that contains spices or herbs. The aroma of spices or herbs is introduced into the stock enhancing its flavor. The stock preparation is started with immersing pieces of desired vegetables into cold water and boiling them on low flame slowly. The stock is boiled for 20 to 30 minutes. Once it reaches room temperature, the stock is stored in a container without adding salt. Its shelf life can be 3 to 4 days if stored in the refrigerator. The shelf life can be extended by boiling it again. The difference between the stock and the broth is that the broth is served as a finished dish whereas stock is the base for further cooking. Also, the stock does not contain any solids but the broth may contain vegetable pieces or noodles. Vegetable Soups Soup is a type of liquid food prepared using vegetable stock. There are three types of soups. They are ? Clear Soup It is a see-through watery soup without pieces of vegetable or noodles in it. This soup can quench hunger and fulfil the requirement of liquid in the body. It is a good appetizer. Thick Soup It is thickened by use of roux, rice flour, potato starch, or cream. These agents blend well with other foods. The thickening may vary depending upon the agent used. Use of a roux creates a smooth and even texture. The roux is cooked along with the longer-simmering vegetables until the desired color is reached. Then the stock is added slowly by stirring constantly to avoid lump formation. As the soup warms, it thickens. Pureed Soup It is prepared by cooking starchy or leafy vegetables in the stock and pureeing the ingredients finely. It generally does not require thickening agent.

Food Operations - Non-Veg Cookery “The only time to eat diet food is while you are waiting for the steak to cook.” … Julia Child, Late American Chef, Author, and TV Personality. Non-veg cookery involves preparing food using eggs, meat, pork, and seafood. There is a very wide variety of non-vegetarian cookery around the world. In some parts of the world, the meat of wild animals is barbequed (often called Brai in Africa) and consumed. A large number of snacks, breakfast items, and main course non-veg dishes can be cooked using various meats. Let us learn about different types of non-veg items. Classification of Eggs Eggs are staple non-veg food. They are used in baking and preparing desserts like mousse. There are many varieties of labelled eggs in the market. Let us understand what those labels mean. Omega-3 Eggs The hens are fed with omega-3 fatty acid sources, such as flax seed. The hens are enclosed in cages, and are kept away from accessing litter, perches or nests. Nest-laid Eggs This means the hens can access their nests or perch within their cage. Eggs of Cage-free Hens Cage-free hens are not confined to a cage, however, that does not mean they have access to the outdoors. Eggs of Free-run Hens Free-run hens can wander around a confined open space, perch, access their nests, but may not access outdoors or natural light. Eggs of Free-range Hens Under good weather conditions, the free-range hens are permitted to wander in open-range barns, and access their nests, perches, litter, outdoors, and natural light. Organic Eggs The hens are fed with 100% organic feed. They are always provided with clean, fresh water. These eggs are most costly. The hens with white feathers and white ear lobes lay white eggs. The ones with brown feathers and red ear lobes lay brown eggs. There is zero nutritional difference between the two eggs. Eggs Sizes Eggs are sized according to their weight. There are various sizes of eggs such as: between 53 - 63gm are Medium, between 63 - 73gm are Large, and the ones weighing more than 73g are Extra Large. Classification of Meats Meat comes from cattle and poultry. They are raised at farms with proper feeding and care. The meat from cattle is more commonly known as red meat. There are various types of meats. Red Meats Red meat can be of the following types ? Beef ? It comes from cattle over 12 months old. This meat is dark red in color with a thick layer of white fat. The meat is hard and thick. Veal ? It is the meat of cattle less than 3 months old. It is deep pink with medium layer of white fat. Veal is lean and tender as compared to beef. Pork ? It is the meat of domestic swine (pig). The meat is light pink in color with a thick layer of creamy-white colored fat. Ham ? It is the meat of pork leg. Bacon ? It is the tender meat of pig’s belly. Pork ribs ? It is the meat around pig’s ribs. Lamb ? It is the tender meat of sheep or goat aged less than one year. It is light red and soft as compared to mutton. Mutton ? It is the meat of sheep or goat older than one year. It is maroon-red colored meat, harder than lamb meat and gives strong flavor. Game Meat (Venison) ? It is the meat of any animal that is hunted for food instead of raised in the farms. It includes the meat of Rabbit, Pheasant, Wild duck, deer, or sometimes a bigger animal like bison. It has strong flavor. The game meat is widely consumed in Africa. Meats take longest time to cook in non-veg cookery. Shelf life of meat is 3 to 4 days in refrigerator or a couple of months in freezer. Poultry It is the meat of domestic fowls such as chicken, duck, goose, or turkey. Good poultry meat comes from well-fed hygienic hens. The poultry must be with well distributed fat and blemish free skin. The dressed poultry is slaughtered, de-feathered, and ready to roast whole bird without head and clamps. Poultry gets cooked faster than red meats but quicker than fish and shell fish. Sausage The sausages are cured and uncooked meat rolls. Sausages are prepared by blending any ground or minced meat with breadcrumbs, starch or flour, and spices, and filling the mixture into casings of various diameter and lengths. At the time of consumption it is cut into slices, often called salamis. Classification of Sea Foods The sea foods mainly is divided into two categories ? Fish ? They are fish with fins and internal skeleton. For example, Tuna, Mackerel, and King fish. Shell Fish ? They are fish with shell but no internal bone structure. For example, Crabs. Let us understand more about Fish. Fish Fish can be cut for cooking in the following form ? Complete ? As caught. Dressed ? Fins, tail, scales, and head removed. Drawn ? Viscera removed. Steak ? Cut into cross section slices, each slice containing a part of bone. Fillets ? Boneless sides of fish; with or without skin. Tranches ? Pieces of fillets. Butterfly Fillet ? Both sides fillets kept naturally joint while cutting. Fish with clear and bulging eyes, firm body, and without foul odor is considered fresh. Let us discuss more about shellfish ? Shellfish Shellfish can be further divided into the following categories ? Mollusks ? They are soft sea animals with shell. There are three types of mollusks namely Bivalves ? They have a pair of hinged shells. For example, Clams, Scallops, and Oysters. Univalves ? They have a single shell. For example, Abalone and Conch. Cephalopods ? They have prominent head and tentacles. For example, Octopus and Squid. Crustaceans ? They have segmented shells and joint legs. For example, Lobster, Shrimp, and Crab. If the tail of Lobster snaps back after pressing, it is fresh. If shrimps are odorless, shells attached firmly, and with bulging eyes, then they are fresh. If the clams and oysters are firmly closed, they are fresh. Storing and Cooking Fish Fish and shellfish are stored either cooked or raw in freezer, or just raw in crushed ice. Fish should be cleaned and scaled properly before cooking. Intestinal track of shrimps need removal. Being tender, fish and shellfish need cooking at moderate temperatures. Small pieces of fish can be cooked directly from freezer. Cooked fish need careful handling to avoid them falling apart. Meat Stock and Fish Stock Meat or Fish Stock is a flavored liquid obtained by boiling meat or fish in water. It is the basis of non-vegetarian soups and sauces. For stock preparation, the chef simmers portions of Veal, Beef, Chicken bones, or Fish bones. The simmering is carried out for longer time than vegetable stock. Bone simmering takes even longer than meat simmering. To shorten the simmering time of bones, they are pressure-cooked. The spices or herbs and salt are added to enhance the flavor. The stock is boiled for 30 to 40 minutes and removed from heat. Once it reaches room temperature, the stock is stored in a container. It lasts fresh for 3 to 4 days if stored in the refrigerator. By boiling it again, its shelf life can be extended. Meat and Fish Soups Soups is a type of liquid food prepared using meat or fish stock as per the choice. There are two types of soups. Clear Soup It is the soup with thin consistency and transparent appearance without pieces of meat or noodles. It is made of meat stock. There is no thickening agent added either. This soup has high proteins and can quench hunger largely. Thick Soup It is thickened by use of roux, rice flour, or starch. The thickening agents blend well with other foods. Different thickening agents provide different consistency. The cartilage and connective tissue in the bones thicken the liquid and bring flavor to the stock. As the meat also provides some amount of fat, the meat soups appear oily too. Some famous meat soups are ? Chicken Soup ? Juliennes of cooked chicken + chicken stock + vegetables. Callaloo ? Thai soup made of cooked crab meat and okra. Clam Chowder ? Cooked and scooped clams + potatoes and onions + bacon. Egg Drop ? Chinese soup made of beaten eggs + chicken broth + black pepper powder + spring onion. Erwtensoep ? A traditional soup from Netherlands, served with sliced sausages. Goulash ? Hungarian soup made of beef + onions + red peppers + paprika powder. Lobster Bisque ? French soup made from Lobster stock. Meat Sauces Sauce is a liquid, semi-liquid, or creamy food cooked by blending multiple other foods with ground meat. They enhance the taste and moisture in the main food. Meat sauces coat pastas or steaks. Their vibrant colors also increase aesthetic appeal of the food. Non-Veg Salads Non-veg salad is made by combining shreds or stripes of cooked chicken, pieces of sausages, or small cubes of cooked mutton, beef, or pork. Egg salad is made up of boiled eggs or scrambled eggs chunks. Fish salads are made of cooked fish stripes in pair with various salad dressings. The pieces of non-veg are often paired with salad vegetables such as tomatoes, celery, lettuce, onions, and cilantro, and some flavorful salad dressings. Pairing chopped salamis or sausages is a great way of preparing non-veg salad. For example, Tuna Salad, Scallops Salad, Chicken Salad. Seeds, Nuts, Herbs, & Spices Just as food absorbs the flavor of spices, it absorbs the attitude of those who cook and serve it. …Anonymous.

Food Operations - Methods of Cooking Cooking is like love, it should be entered into with abandon or not at all. …Harriet Van Horne, American newspaper columnist & film critic When it comes to the cookery part of food production operations, it is very important to select an appropriate cooking method. The cooking method has a direct impact on the taste, texture, appearance, and flavor of the resulting food product. There are three types of cooking used widely ? Dry heat cooking Moist heat cooking Combination cooking Dry Heat Cooking This cooking involves cooking food without using water or stock. It is a quick method to cook food, in which the food items come out a little crisp. Generally small, tender, and thin food items are cooked using oil under dry heat cooking methods. The resulting food has nice smoky aroma because of caramelization and browning. The following dry heat cooking methods are popular ? Broiling It involves cooking the food items by exposing it directly to heat such as open fire, coal, grill or electric coil. Meat steaks and whole fish are broiled. Grilling It is a method of cooking by placing the food on a mesh of cast iron. Millard reaction brings flavor to the food being cooked. The resulting food is quite dry, reduced with oil. It is ideal for small to medium shaped meat cuts, vegetables, tofu, or cottage cheese. Roasting It is a way of cooking food by exposing it to dry radiant heat over open fire, in oven, or at times within surrounding hot embers, sand, or stones. Vegetables, meat, corn on cob, potatoes, and sweet potatoes are roasted. Baking It is a manner of cooking food by exposing it to prolonged dry heat, normally in an oven, hot embers, or on hot stones. The heat is gradually transferred from the surface of the food item being baked to its center which gives it a firm dry crust and a soft center. Baking needs high temperature control. Breads, cookies, pies, and tarts are baked. Sautéing It is frying the food items with little oil in a pan exposed to high heat. The food in the pan requires stirring and tossing so that it does not burn because of high heat. Shallow Frying It promotes browning and Maillard reaction. The food is cooked in more amount of oil than used in sautéing to that a surface of the food is always in contact with the oil. The food is turned occasionally till it gets cooked evenly. Deep Frying The food is immersed in the ample amount of oil that is heated up to its smoking point. The food is turned for even cooking. The resulting food is very crispy. Fritters, Potato chips, Pakoras (Onion-Chick Pea flour fritters), and Vadas are deep fried. Moist Heat Cooking This cooking is carried out by immersing the food item in a liquid such as water, stock, or wine; at various temperatures ranging between 60oC to above 100oC. Following are some of the essential stages of moist heat cooking ? Poaching It is done by heating liquid to temperature around 70oC to 85oC where liquid in the pan is hot but not bubbling hot. The bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan or pot. Poaching is used for very delicate food items such as fish or eggs. Simmering It is done by immersing food item completely in the liquid and heating it at 85oC to 95oC; the temperature is hotter than that in poaching. Bubbles form and gradually rise to the surface. It is the standard method followed for preparing soups and stocks. Boiling It is carried out at the hottest temperatures of the three techniques; above 100oC. The high temperature toughens some foods such as meat and eggs. It breaks delicate food items such as fish and vegetables. Steaming It is carried out by heating the liquids like water past its boiling point (212o F) and generates steam. Steam carries more heat than boiling water. It is the most appropriate method for cooking seafood, vegetables, and other delicate food items. Combination Cooking It involves both; use of dry heat as well as moist heat cooking. Combination cooking is performed as slow cooking. It is an excellent way of cooking thick vegetables and tougher meat cuts. There are two basic types of this cooking ? Braising It includes two step cooking with light frying of food and then immersing it in liquid to make stew. In the first step, the food is fried with adequate oil. While frying or sautéing, the heat is transferred to food via pan. In the next step, a liquid is added to it and the food is cooked while the pan is covered with a lid. This way, the steam is caught in the pan and the heat is transferred to the food by convection. Meat curries and stews are braised. Braising is used to cook large portions of meats such as beef, pork, and game. The meat cuts are often immersed partially. Stewing This is also very similar to braising as far as the cooking steps are concerned. Stewing uses small to medium uniform cuts of tender meat such as poultry or lamb, or vegetables. In case of stewing, the cuts of meat or vegetables are completely immersed in the liquid. Stewing takes little lesser time than braising. Food Production Operations - Planning Menu What nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast? …Anthony Bourdain, American Chef and TV Personality. In food production and operations, planning of menu is an important task. If the chef plans the menu in advance, it is easy to deliver ready food items on time. A ready menu can help organize the food preparation and ensures the chef cooks not only tasty but also healthy and nutritious food. It also helps in reducing wastage of food items and cooking fuel resources, and thus saves money. Menu planning also facilitates purchasing and storing required food items. If a food preparation organization is providing multiple cuisines from all over the world, menu planning makes the theme easy. What is Menu? Menu is the detailed list of food items offered at the food service establishment. Menu planning is nothing but selection of menu for an occasion or otherwise. Menu can be different for different meals of the day such as breakfast, lunch, brunch, and dinner. What is Course? It is a sequential serving of dishes or the sets of dishes under a meal. A meal can contain at least three to at the most eleven courses. There are two prominent types of menus ? The food menu, beverage menu, and bar menu. Food Menus The structure of food menus largely depends on the type of cuisine, time of the day, and serving styles. The dinner menu is generally arranged course wise. For Example, Appetizers, Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages. Types of Food Menus There are various types of food menus ? d' hôte ?

Food Operations - Introduction to Bakery You are the boss of that dough. …Julia Child, American chef, author, and TV personality. Bakery can extend into past years of history. Romans first came with the art of baking and due to globalization it spread worldwide. Baked foods are healthy, tasty, and flavorful. They are in demand on special occasions such as weddings, parties, and social feasts. What is Baking? Baking is a manner of cooking food by exposing it to direct heat or heated stones for long time under controlled temperature. Baking is not just limited to cakes, breads and biscuits but practically a wide range of sweet and savory foods such as pies, cookies, tarts, Baati (Indian baked bread consumed in North-West region), Rodgaa (Indian baked bread consumed in east Maharashtra region of India), and snacks can be baked. Baked food often comes up with aromatic food. There are five basic ingredients required for baking ? Flour Sugar Margarine Baking Soda/Powder Salt Commodities Used in Baking Given below are some food commodities used in baking ? Flour ? It is the basic ingredient of baking cookies, breads, cakes, muffins, pizzas, tarts, and pastries. Its variants are self-rising flour, wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cake flour, etc. Essence ? It is an extract acquired from a plant or other matter used for flavoring food. Some typical essence are almond, vanilla, saffron, lemon and rose. Margarine or Butter ? Margarine is made of refined vegetable oil, water, and milk. Butter is made of processing milk. These both are called shortening. Sugar ? It is used as food sweetener. Eggs ? They are used as leavening and binding agents and they can bring moisture in the cakes. The chefs need to add either yogurt or applesauce in eggless cakes. Baking Powder/Yeast ? It is used as a rising/leavening agent that gives softness and fluffy texture to cakes and breads. The baking powder is white fine powder made of Sodium Bicarbonate, Potassium Bitartrate, and corn starch. The yeast comes in two variants ? dry and liquid. Cocoa Powder ? It is used for introducing chocolate flavor to the food. Chocolate slabs ? They are used for acquiring flakes by grating and then using the flakes for garnishing and decorating cakes. They come in the variety of chocolate-milk-sugar proportion. Now chocolate drops or chips are also available in the market. Fruit Jams ? They are used for decorating sweet baked products. Milk ? It is used for softening batter for the cakes, breads, and cookies. Salt ? A pinch of salt is added into batter of sweet baked products to balance the taste of Baking powder and sugar. Some typical equipment required in baking are ? Ovens ? They are used as a heating chambers for baking. Direct heat large kilns and modern electric ovens are used in food preparation units. The electric ovens provide high degree of precise temperature control and uniform heat. Mixing Machine ? It is used to mix all bread or cake ingredients together into soft dough or batter. Tins ? There are tins with various shapes and sizes used in baking. They create the resulting baked product in attractive shapes. Icing Bag with Nozzles ? The icing bags hold the icing. They are used in decorating cakes in a large variety of ways using nozzles of catchy shapes and widths. They provide a great way of filling small glasses and molds in a sophisticated manner. Baking Parchment ? It is a cellulose-based paper used as a non-stick surface. It is often thin and disposable. Knives ? Bakery knives are used for cutting loafs, cakes, and handling pieces of cakes. Cake Stands ? They are required to keep cakes of multiple tiers. Some of them are rotary. They provide circular motion that makes the process of cake decoration easy. Spatula ? They are flat tip spoons, used to fold the batter and fill the icing bag. Spatulas often have rubber tips. Basic Bread Fabrication Bread fabrication is a complex process. Once started, it cannot be interrupted, as timing is very important for bread making. There are 12 important stages of baking a bread. Weighing Ingredients During this stage, the chef assembles all the required ingredients and weigh them properly to ensure a good quality final product. Preparing Ingredients The chef selects an appropriate flour and sieves it. The chef also prepares yeast mixture by adding right amount of water of right temperature into the dry yeast. Mixing the Ingredients Mixing the ingredients is not as simple as it sounds. There are various factors that need consideration such as room temperature, flour temperature, speed of machine, the timings of adding various ingredients like margarine, sugar, yeast etc. Bulk Fermentation During bulk fermentation, the yeast acts on sugar in the flour and releases carbon dioxide and alcohol while it respires. The gas makes the flour dough rise and the alcohol brings flavor to the bread. The longer the fermentation, the more intense the aroma. Folding/Degassing Folding a dough is superior to simply punching it down. Folding involves gently kneading the dough into parts and new rolls. Degassing is a very important piece of the bread jigsaw. It removes some of the carbon dioxide and redistribute the food for yeast so that the yeast can resume to their meal. Dividing A large dough is divided into several smaller portions to make loaves or buns. Benching At this stage, the dough is kept for a while so that the gluten can rest and shaping becomes easy. This time is not more than a few minutes. Shaping At this stage, the baker shapes the bread for various looks such as loaves, buns, begels, baguette, rolls, sticks, and other various shapes. Shaping affects the physical form of the bread. Proofing Once the dough is made into a desired shape, the baker keeps it for the final fermentation before it enters the oven. Proofing affects the chemical form of the bread. Baking The baker preheats the oven and keeps the doughs into it under a controlled temperature. Cooling In this stage, the baker takes out the bread and sets on the racks for exposing it to the air for cooling. Some breads such as baguette are eaten at room temperature. The bread is thus ready to be consumed. Types of Cakes Cakes are named according to the way they are prepared. S.No. Type & Preparation 1 Butter cakes They contain fat such as butter. It starts with beating sugar and butter together until the sugar dissolves partially and then adding dry and wet ingredients alternatively. The resulting cake is light and rich with moisture. For example, Pound cake made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. 2 Layer Cakes They also contain butter and can be made by arranging layers of different butter cakes. For example, Golden cake, Birthday cake. 3 Sponge cake They do not contain fat or leavener such as baking powder. The preparation starts with whipping eggs or egg whites such that it becomes fluffy with air. Dry ingredients are sifted and folded in gently. During baking, the air expands to rise the cake on its own. It gives extremely light and spongy but less moist cake. 4 Angel Food Cake It contains egg whites and no egg yolks. Preparation starts with beating egg whites until they are firm and adding dry ingredients gently. This cake is very white and delicate. It is often paired with addition of fruits. It is cooled by inverting it on the cooking rack. 5 Genoise It is a kind of sponge cake made with whole eggs. In the preparation, eggs and sugar are combined and whipped in the pan kept over simmering water. They are sliced into thin horizontal layers and stacked with alternate layers of cream/frosting and slices to create layered cake. For example, Swiss roll. 6 Flourless Baked Cake It does not contain flour. All ingredients are folded gently and poured into a pan that is kept in a larger pan which is partially filled with water. This water bath is arranged to reduce effect of strong heat from oven to this delicate cake. For example, cheese cake. 7 Flourless Unbaked Cake They are chilled instead of baking. The bottom is often crusted with a layer of cake and on the top of it whipped cream and egg white is added. For example, Chocolate mousse. Pastry It is a dough often used for preparing both, sweet and savory meals. It contains flour, shortening like butter or oil, sugar, water, and salt. A filling is put inside the pastry and it is baked to get resulting food with crispy coat. There are various pastries made such as short crust pastry, puff pastry, and Filo pastry. For example, pastry is used for pies, puffs, croissants, and tarts. Pastes, Creams, Fillings, and Sauces Baked items often look and taste good when paired with fillings and creams, and topped with sauces. They bring tempting presentation to the main cake or bread and also extend their flavor. Pastes Pastes are the compound of fruit pulp, lemon juice, and sugar. The bakers often add light spices such as cinnamon or cardamom, which go well with the sweet taste. Some widely used pastes in bakery are ? Apple paste Banana paste Coconut paste Guava paste Mango paste For preparing savory puffed pastries, ginger-garlic paste is also used. Creams Their texture changes as per the amount of butterfat they contain. The higher the butterfat contents, less whipping is required to get thick cream. Half and Half/Single Cream ? It contains around 15% fat. It cannot be whipped as it contains proportion of cream and milk as 50:50. It goes well with coffee or on cereal. Whipping Cream ? It contains around 30% fat and it is thick enough to be whipped. Double Cream ? It contain around 48% fat. It cannot get whipped well. Fillings The fillings have a strong foot in the domain of desserts, cakes, and other bakery products. The fillings provide delicate flavor and aroma. A perfect filling has a good spreading ability and consistency. Some of the widely used fillings are ? Chocolate filling Coffee fillings Almond filling Cashew nut filling Hazelnut filling Peanut filling Sauces Various sweet sauces often known as dessert sauces are used with cakes and desserts that take them to the next heights. They contribute flavor and moisture to the dessert. The dessert sauces are made by combining cooked fruit pieces, sugar, and liquid caramel or light alcohol such as wine. Some popular ones are crème Anglaise, classic caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, strawberry sauce, raspberry sauce, blueberry sauce, butterscotch sauce, and fruit curds.

Food Production Operations - Indian Cooking Indian food is like classical music raga- it takes time to build up to a crescendo. … Shobhaa De, Indian Model and Author. Indian cuisine boasts about the widest variety of tastes, exotic aromas, and preparation methods. Being a country of diverse culture, the taste and preparation of food changes every few hundred kilometers along with the language dialects. North Indian food is completely different in terms of look, flavor, and taste from South Indian food. Similarly, East-Indian food is totally different in its form than the food from West-Indian lands. Indian cuisine is recognized as part of different regions such as Asamese, Andhrite, Bengali, Gujrati, Kashmiri, Marathi, Punjabi, South Indian, and many more. Widely Used Ingredients in Indian Cuisine There are some special ingredients that an Indian kitchen stocks. The stock includes some gourmet dairy products such as Ghee and Paneer. These two dairy products are used in preparing sweets as well as savory dishes. Ghee Ghee is nothing but clarified butter, which is superior to the ordinary butter in terms of contents and flavor. The procedure of preparing this dairy product is little lengthy but the efforts and time spent on their preparation are worth the aroma and body they deliver to the food. The procedure goes as follows ? Accumulate 8 parts of full cream of milk in a large deep pan. Add 2 parts of thick sour curds and mix well and keep aside for 4 to 5 hours. When the entire cream turns sour, beat it with the electric beater for around 20 minutes using water as required. This action separates butter and white buttermilk. The buttermilk is used in preparing a savory dish called Kadhi. It can be consumed as an appetizer too. Take out butter in a heavy bottom pan. Heat it on low flame till you get to see brownish golden burnt milk solids deposited at the bottom of the pan and a transparent golden ghee on the top of it. Paneer This is a basic ingredient of Paneer based gravies and desserts. Boil 2 liters milk in a deep pan. When it is coming to full boil, add 2 to 3 tbsp vinegar into it. Stir for a while occasionally. Boil for a few minutes further till you get to see milk chunks separated from thin white whey. Place a clean cotton cloth with edges spread outwards in another deep pan. Put water separated milk solids into the cloth. Assemble the edges of cloth to drain the whey completely and you get Paneer. Cut into pieces of desired shape and store in the freezer. Some other important ingredients kept handy are ? Dalia ? Coarsely broken wheat. It is used to prepare a porridge-like snack. Semolina (Suji) ? Finely broken wheat. It is used to prepare Halwa or Upma. Beaten Rice (Poha) ? Dry, flat, flaky rice used in preparing various snacks. Puffed Rice (Murmura) ? It is roasted rice in special kiln to make it puffed. It is used to make a spicy snack called Chiwda. Jaggery (Gud) ? thick boiled and solidified pulp of sugarcane juice. It is added in lentils and veg dishes to balance hot and sour taste. Vermicelli (Semiyan) Long and thin spaghetti made of wheat flour. They are used for cooking a dessert named kheer and a snack named Upma. Kokum ? They are the dried peels of a fruit from a plant belonging to Mangosteen family. They leave dark red juice when soaked in warm water. This juice is used in preparation of seafood gravies, and a spicy savory chilled drink named Solkadhi. Kokum gives sour taste to the food and can be replaced by Aamchur or Tamarind Pulp. Tamarind ? It is a pod-like, flat, long, and pulpy fruit with greenish brown shell as thick as egg shell. Inside, there is a brown fruit held with ridges. Both raw and ripe tamarind is used in chutneys and gravies. Puffed Split Chick Peas (Chana) ? Chick peas are roasted to make them puffed and they are shelled. These puffed peas are used in preparing snacks like Chiwda, toffees like Chikki, and chutneys. Importance of Chhonk in Indian Cuisine Chhonk (popularly known as Tadka) is a cooking method by which aroma of various spices extracted and incorporated in the food. Five main ingredients are put in chhonk by heating oil in a pan: Mustard seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida, turmeric powder, and curry leaves. Sometimes finely chopped green chili or garlic, juliennes of ginger, ginger-garlic paste, fennel seeds, or red chili powder, is added to release their aroma. These ingredients can vary according to the cuisine. The chhonk not only adds aroma of spices to the food but also acts as a hunger inducing medium. Indian Veg Stews Indian cookery offers a very wide variety of stews preparation. The vegetable stews are made of diced vegetables. The vegetables are cooked by combining them with various spice mixes. For thickening the stew, either grated coconut, peanut, tomato, or onion pastes are used. Then they are seasoned with chhonk.

Other Indian Daals In India, field beans, moth beans, green beans, black-eyed beans and horse beans are often sprouted and cooked with grated coconut, chopped onion and tomatoes, and ginger-garlic paste. Indian Flatbreads Indian flatbreads form a major part of the main course. They are prepared from the dough of wheat flour, gram flour, or all-purpose flour. The doughs are gently rolled on a smooth platform using a rolling pin to get them in the form of flat thin disks. These disks are generally termed as Rotis. The Rotis are baked on a flat pan or skillet called Tawa. There are myriad types of Indian flatbreads when it comes to the composition of ingredients and method of preparation. Plain Roti This is a flatbread prepared in most regions of India. It is prepared using wheat flour dough, little oil, and some salt for taste. Ingredients ? 2 cups whole wheat flour, ½ tbsp. salt, 2 tbsp. oil, ½ tea spoon salt, water. Preparation ? Mix the flour and salt and knead it into a fine dough using water and oil. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each dough into the shape of flat disks. Bake them on both sides on a heated Tawa. In large food preparation units, kneading and rolling equipment as well as automatic roti making machines are used that prepare ready to eat Rotis. Rumali Roti (Rumali = Like Handkerchief) This is a very thin roti eaten with stews and lentils. The name comes from its thin form and way of folding, similar to a handkerchief. Ingredients ? Same as plain roti ingredients; with 1 cup whole wheat flour replaced by 1 cup all-purpose flour. Plus 4 tbsp Ghee. Preparation ? Mix the flour and salt and knead it into a fine dough using water and oil. Divide the dough into 16 equal portions. Roll two small doughs into the shape of small flat disks. Apply ghee or oil on one of them. Place the second rolled disk on the first one. Without sealing edges, roll them together into large flat and thin disk. Bake them on both sides on a heated Tawa. When each side is baked properly, separate the two layers and fold them as a fold of a handkerchief. Paratha It is cooked by stuffing some cooked dry vegetables little mashed and spiced in the dough and rolling into thick disk. Ingredients ? For dough, same as roti. Plus any dry stuffing made by cooked vegetables. It can be made of cooked potatoes, cauliflower, cottage cheese, or any other vegetable of choice and imagination. Preparation ? Prepare dough by following first two steps of Roti. Take a small dough. Roll it into 3 inch diameter disk. Place a small serving of the stuffing on it and bring the edge of the disk together and seal them to make a ball. Flatten it slightly. Apply some flour and roll it gently. Bake it on both sides using ghee or butter. Puri It is puffed bread. Ingredients ? 2 cups wheat flour, 1 teaspoon sugar, ½ tbsp. salt, water and oil for deep frying. Preparation ?

Knead into a very soft dough and let it stand in warm place for 20 minutes. Make 8 equal portions of the dough. Take a small dough and roll it into 3 inch diameter round disk. Spread little ghee or butter. Fold the disk half. Apply ghee again on the visible surface and fold it to bring a look of a circle’s quarter. Roll it into flat little thick disk, which should resemble a triangle with rounded corners. Bake it on both sides till half done. Place it on the wire rack and hold the rack directly on the flame. Turn the naan and let it bake on the other side till done completely. The naan looks thick bread with bubbly surface. Applying ghee on the top of the hot naan gives butter naan version. It tastes good with any spicy veg or non-veg gravy. Bhatura It is similar to Puri in appearance but it is bigger and puffier than Puri. The dough for Bhatura is prepared using little curds, water and salt. It is consumed with spicy chick-pea gravy. This pairing is popularly known as Chana-Bhatura.

Food Operations - Kitchen Communication There's a bond among a kitchen staff, I think. You spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family. …Gordon Ramsay, British Chef and Restaurateur. Every commercial business needs effective communication and commercial kitchen is not an exception. Places like commercial food preparation units, communication is vital to execute the culinary operations successfully and smoothly. In the domain of commercial kitchen, if the right information is shared at the right time with the right person, it can help to increase kitchen productivity. Role of a Kitchen Manager The kitchen manager is a chief chef of the kitchen who is responsible for overall operation of the kitchen. Being the leader of a busy team, the kitchen manager needs to be quick at solving real problems occurring in the kitchen. The kitchen manager’s responsibilities include ? Ensuring all food items are prepared and served according to the preparation unit’s recipes, portioning, cooking, and serving standards. Monitoring and controlling the inventory of kitchen items. Supervising the food preparation activities in the kitchen. Supervising if hygiene and cleanliness standards are met. Scheduling the staff according to the working time. Training the new staff. Monitoring equipment maintenance issues. Play active role in achieving the financial target of the food preparation unit. Creating food plans and budget plans for special occasions. Recording key pieces of information such as staff schedules, employee performance and attendance, food and beverage sale, customer’s lost and found, and duty reports in a timely manner. Taking Orders Taking orders from the customer or guests is a two way communication process. Let us say there are two persons, the guest and the server. The guests prefer to place order to a knowledgeable or qualified server. The server must ? Be aware of basic food preparation, recipes of various food items on the menu. Have an eye for detail and accurate in recording the order. Know the slang/local words used by the customers. Be able to describe preparation in words shortly. Know the time required to prepare menu items. Know what accompaniments go well with each menu item and which menu items complement each other. Know the prices for each item offered on the menu. Be polite and friendly; but not casual. Not assume anything about the customer even if the customer is a frequent visitor. The customers often ask questions about the preparation of the food, serving size in case of beverages, pizza, and otherwise, filling and cooking types in case of sandwiches, subs, and pizzas, and toppings in case of pastries and ice creams. The server must record every detail by communicating with the guest clearly. Executing Orders The server manually hands over the order in the kitchen to begin preparation of the dishes. Once the order is in hand, the team work shows up in execution. The Chef de cuisine, the sous chef, the line chefs, runners, and other staff; all need to work harmoniously in the kitchen. They need to communicate clearly to avoid any unwelcomed outcomes in the process of food preparation as well as service of food. To avoid communication loopholes, each member of the kitchen staff must ? Understand the role and responsibility of oneself as well as other team members. Be willing to share information and experiences with each other. It is important especially when the duty shift changes. Must know all the areas in the kitchen and the places of preparation equipment, serving equipment, and ingredients store. Be willing to support less-skilled or new staff member. Be able to deliver the best results in the least possible time. Previous Page Print Next Page   Advertisements Write for us FAQ's Helping Contact © Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved. go
